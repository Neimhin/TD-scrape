          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The people voted "Yes" in the referendum on the stability treaty.  We would all agree that, as we knocked on doors and travelled the country, there was a genuine fear among the people regarding the future prospects for their children, the country and, more important, dealing with the wider eurozone crisis which is having a direct impact on prospects here.  The Taoiseach was in contact with Chancellor Merkel last Friday and it appears that, for the first time, he raised with her the bank debt issue and, in particular, the promissory note issue.  The feedback from the conversation does not seem to be positive, particularly from German officials who have been quoted as saying it would send a negative signal.  In perhaps what was the understatement of the year one of them said, "We do not see need for movement at the moment."  It is generally accepted that the eurozone is facing a make or break crisis.  What is required is substantial change and decisive intervention, including a uniform bank debt resolution regime, a deposit guarantee scheme modelled on the American system and a central fund to aid the recapitalisation of risky but saveable European banks.  Even agreeing to all of this in principle would bring immediate relief to the markets.  However, every time a story points to progress, Germany quickly rubbishes any prospect of same.  Germany is entitled to its views and assert its position, but its policy position is profoundly wrong and not serving the euro well.  The time has come for the German authorities and the Chancellor to be told directly that either there will be a radical move on euro level involvement in sovereign bonds or the European Union will be dragged into much deeper and sustained economic decline.  It is also time for other eurozone countries, including Ireland, to point out that the euro has benefited Germany enormously, particularly in terms of the surpluses it has enjoyed for a number of years and which it is so reluctant to share.  The Irish people have tackled our deficit problems with great fortitude, sacrifice and urgency, but a significant proportion of our bank-related debt was incurred only because of wider European fears of contagion.  That argument no longer holds water, and the claim that any deal in regard to Ireland's bank debt would set an unacceptable precedent is rubbish at this stage.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_3">When the Taoiseach raised this issue with Chancellor Merkel, did he request specifically a write-down of Irish bank debt, particularly in regard to the promissory note, or a restructuring thereof?  Will he indicate exactly what he requested of the Chancellor during that particular conversation and her response to him on the bank debt issue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I thank the Deputy for his question.  As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, he will appreciate how these discussions and negotiations take place.  I very much welcome the very strong, clear and decisive decision of the Irish people last week in respect of the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty.  I thank Deputy Martin and his party and all of those across civil society who supported it.  Were we meeting in this House today with a negative impact from the putting of that question to the people, we would be in a very different position.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have always said that the banking situation was a separate question from that which the people were asked last week in the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty.  After the decision in the referendum became clear, I spoke to Prime Minister Monti, the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Barroso, the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande and Prime Minister Rajoy, to whom I made it perfectly clear that this was the decision of the Irish people following a vigorous campaign in respect of the fiscal stability treaty, both for and against.  I emphasised that the people were very clear in their view as to their positioning in so far as the euro was concerned, in terms of being a member of the eurozone and the European Union.  I also made it clear to the leaders that it was perfectly obvious that a resolution needs to be brought about in respect of the banking situation.  This is a tortuous and complex process and there are no simple, quick-fix solutions.  I remind Deputy Martin that named officials quoted in newspapers are not politicians.  I made the point last week, standing on the steps of Government Buildings with the Tánaiste, that this is a situation which requires consideration, assessment and decision by political leaders, not technocrats or officials, notwithstanding the important role they play.  It is a question for politicians and political leaders to decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">I happened to be one of the first to make the point, in Dublin Castle some weeks ago, regarding the possibility of licensing the European Stability Mechanism for direct injection into the banking situation.  I am glad this position has gained credence with a number of countries and leaders.  I am also happy to note that Europe is now having a proper debate, and the construction of a proper debate, on the question of a separation of the sovereign from bank debts.  This is the start of a strategy which I hope will bring a political conclusion to the issue.  As Deputy Martin is well aware, an assessment is going on in Spain in respect of the liabilities of Spanish banks.  I note the comments yesterday by Spain's budget Minister, Mr. Montoro, in this regard.  An election will be held in Greece on 17 June and the French national elections will take place this month.  The ratification process in regard to the fiscal treaty is ongoing in several countries, as well as the process of the European Commission presenting its medium and longer-term proposals to deal both with the banking situation and longer-term issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">In my talks with European leaders I clearly stated the reasons, from my perspective, that the Irish people gave a resounding and decisive answer to the question they were asked.  I also pointed out that the question of the banking problem in the eurozone must now be dealt with, and dealt with politically.  In that regard, I am writing to all of the leaders today and we will continue to negotiate as we have done, both with the troika and leading on to the question as to what can happen in respect of possible changes to the ESM.  That is an issue I intend to pursue vigorously with leaders as appropriate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I asked the Taoiseach a very simple question: what did Chancellor Merkel say to him?  He raised these issues with her, but what did she say in response?</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The Taoiseach mentioned officials and so on.  The Canadian Prime Minister put it succinctly when he said we were four years into the crisis and still trying to get a sense of what the game plan was at European leaders' level.  That is what external commentators are saying about the succession of European summits.  Every summit in the past 15 months was said to be a breakthrough in dealing with the crisis only for hopes to be dashed within months.  Now Spain is on the precipice.  Its budget Minister has said the doors to the markets are no longer open to Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The Taoiseach raised the issue of the ESM and said that in his view it should be used and have its mandate changed to facilitate the recapitalisation of and aid banks.  We support that, but why are we debating the ESM legislation today without that mandate?  The German Chancellor has opposed changing the mandate of the ESM to facilitate the recapitalisation of banks.  Did she say this to the Taoiseach in her conversation with him this week?  He said he had advocated this change to the mandate.  Did he say this to the Chancellor and what did she say in response?  What did she say to him about a decisive intervention to change what was happening at European level?  We did not advocate a "Yes" vote on the debt issue.  We clearly separated it, unlike some of the Taoiseach's Ministers who subsequent to the vote again raised it.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">We need a deal on the bank debt issue to ensure sustainability into the future.  That is the fundamental issue in regard to the Irish position.  The European Union needs a different approach to the issue in terms of the sustainability of the euro.  The House will debate and pass the ESM legislation today, yet the Taoiseach advocated that the mandate of the ESM needed to change.  I have had no indication from him as to whether the Chancellor agrees with him.  What did he say to her?  What did she say to him about Irish bank debt?</p>

          <p eId="para_13">Are there secrets between the Germans and the Irish?  I will put it this way to Deputy Micheál Martin who is well aware that this is not like a situation in which the British Prime Minister, for instance, may find himself where there is a Prime Minister, a Parliament and a bank.  In this case there are 17 Prime Ministers, 17 Parliaments and one bank.  As these Parliaments and Prime Ministers have different views, it is not a case of starting a process in which there is consensus across the board.  In fact, at the European Council meeting at which the issue growth was discussed I also raised the question of the possibility of licensing the ESM in respect of a direct injection into banks and separating sovereign debt from bank debt.  That view was shared by quite a number of other leaders.  It is the right argument the European Union should now make.  The point is that 17 Governments, 17 Parliaments and one bank have to-----</p>

In our view, the outcome represented more the fear of the people than the will of the people, but we respect the result and congratulate the Government and Fianna Fáil.  It is funny to listen to Fianna Fáil having a sham fight with the Government, but we congratulate them all on the success of their campaign.  The Taoiseach must now deliver on and fulfil his referendum commitments to remove the burden of the banking debt from Irish citizens and initiate genuine job stimulus projects.

We have had discussions about this for a long period.  All of the prime ministers, and the president, to whom I spoke understand that this month of June will see the French elections and the Greek elections, and the result of the assessment of the Spanish banks and the extent of the liability there.  The issues that will be put forward by the European Commission in respect of proposals for medium and longer term solutions here will be the focus of the attention of the decision to be made, arrived at or put on the table at the June meeting.

          <p eId="para_92">There were firm commitments made by the Taoiseach and by the Government side to have a genuine jobs stimulus.  The Taoiseach was converted to the notion of growth in the course of all of this, although there was not a mention of the word "growth" when he came back with the treaty.  The Taoiseach also made a commitment in terms of removing the bank burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">I wish the Taoiseach well with all of his telephone calls, but he did not tell us what those he telephoned stated to him.  He did not even tell us what he stated to them.  The problem is - this is the crux of it - the Taoiseach never raised these issues at summits or at meetings with other European leaders.  He has told us that on many occasions in the Dáil.  In fact, he boasted here that he would never have the word "defaulter" on our foreheads.  He has never raised the issue of bank debt.  The Taoiseach has now had a road to Frankfurt conversion, but there is a credibility issue in him persuading European leaders, who see the "Yes" vote as an endorsement of their policies.  Who could blame them, seeing as the Taoiseach has continuously echoed their policies?  The Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel are on the same page on austerity and all of these other right-wing ideological positions.  Leaving aside the Taoiseach's failure to tell us the outcome of his telephone conversations, he should tell us how he will get the burden of this bank debt relieved from taxpayers here and how he will initiate Government-led and EU-led jobs stimulus initiatives.  He should forget about all of those to whom he spoke last week.  That was grand.  As I stated, my party wishes the Taoiseach well.  The Taoiseach should tell us how he will do this.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_87">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_94">There will be statements later on the European Council meeting.  There will be plenty of opportunity in the House to discuss the response by Government of the bringing forward of a stimulus package in respect of growth and investment, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will present that in due course here.  There is much consideration and much work going on.  Deputy Adams will be aware that both Deputy Howlin and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had intensive discussions with the EIB only a few weeks ago in respect of blockages in the system for PPPs and the opportunity for further investment from the EIB in sustainable infrastructure projects.  The Minister will bring in his proposal in that regard shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">The question I discussed with Chancellor Merkel was that fiscal discipline and growth are not two polar ends; they are compatible.  If one has good housekeeping rules, which is what the fiscal stability treaty is about, and one puts these together with a growth and investment and stimulus plan, it would bring the most beneficial results for people in terms of investment for job opportunities and work.  This will be the focus for meetings in future arising from discussions at the last Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Let no one run away with the idea that there is a simplistic solution to what is involved.  Deputy Adams should note that even if one had agreement with the majority of leaders on a particular strategy, the changes and the valuations required, and the processes and the legal systems involved in various countries are tortuous and complex.  As someone who has been through the peace process here and who understands the way very sensitive negotiations, to which he was a party for many years, proceed, he will appreciate that it is not always possible to give the final result of all the words and issues spoken.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Anyway, my message in writing and to the individual leaders is that this issue must be dealt with by political leaders who must make political decisions in respect of dealing with this crisis.  It is the right argument and the right discussion to be involved in with regard to the separation of sovereign debt from bank debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">I note Deputy Adams's comments about the burdens here.  He could do his bit when he leaves the Chamber today by announcing that the his legal team will not accept any fees for the stunt he pulled down at the High Court as a matter of public interest.</p>

Like all Members, I welcome the Taoiseach's forthrightness in ringing the German Chancellor and stating that, whether at a political level or otherwise, we want a bank deal on the agenda.  We should see more of that and we should have seen more of it before now.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">I welcome the decision of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to state that any deal given to Spain as part of the coming bailout, which is inevitable, should not be on more favourable terms than those given to Ireland, and, if they are more favourable, then we should benefit from them retrospectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">This is exactly the stance which I hope the Taoiseach and others will take to the summit in Europe and to the multiple telephone conversations in future.  There is a danger, not as a result of this referendum, that the big countries in Europe will continue to get preferential treatment regardless of the result of this referendum.  They may be right or wrong but the Government, Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have stated that this result gives them added clout - I gather the phrase used was "authority in Europe" - which they can bring to the table at the summit at the end of June.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Given that the summit will be about growth, will the Taoiseach spell out whether he will bring the issue of banking debt to the political leaders in attendance?  The Tánaiste has stated the greatest boost that could be given to growth would be to secure some relief on the bank debt.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance he will have this issue placed on the agenda as part of the promised growth pact?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_107">Deputy Ross should understand the Government and I do not seek any congratulations.  As he is well aware, once the Bill was published, the referendum issue became the people's property and it was, therefore, the people's decision.  It is the Irish people who the Deputy would be right to congratulate on the clarity and decisiveness of their decision.  The Deputy put together a Private Members' Bill which was unconstitutional in the sense that it sought to defer a decision which had become the property of the people.  The Bill could not apply because had it been followed through, it would have meant that it may not have been able to hold any future referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">I assure Deputy Ross that the issue of the bank crisis will be on the agenda.  I assume it will be a central issue for the June meeting and it may become necessary to have some serious reflection on it before the end of June.  I do not know when the report on the assessment of the Spanish banks' liability will become fully known but it is an issue about which I spoke to Prime Minister Rajoy.  As the Deputy is aware, a deep and intensive analysis of the scale of that liability is taking place as we speak.  It does not follow automatically that a decision to extend a particular facility to a country would apply across the board.  However, there is certainly a strong case for political justice to be seen to be done in respect of facilities being given to one country or another.  The Irish case is very well known to all of the leaders to whom I spoke, to the extent that I made it perfectly clear that the Irish people's view is that a deal on the bank crisis would have very beneficial effects for this country, both in terms of our capacity to meet our debt liabilities and our ability to become the first eurozone country to emerge from a programme, which would also be in Europe's interest.  These issues all form part of the discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">While Ireland is not the biggest country or most powerful economy, Irish people have taken many difficult decisions and have had to put up with the consequences of these decisions in the country's longer-term interest of emerging from the programme.  I assure Deputy Ross that, from a political perspective, the Government will not waste any opportunity to make the case, not only from our national perspective but also as a member of the eurozone, that politicians - political leaders - now need to make political decisions on the strategy for the road ahead.  I temper that by stating we will not have a quick fix decision which will apply in this case because, as I indicated to Deputies Martin and Adams, all of these matters involve tortuous and complex discussions from legal, constitutional and financial perspectives across 17 different parliaments and with one bank involved.  The issue is central to the agenda and will be central to the June meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I look forward not to a quick fix but an early result and early relief on the bank debt.  I will flag an issue to the Taoiseach, having flagged it previously, because it is becoming much more dangerous.  Reports are emerging from Germany and the Bundestag that the German Parliament will not be able to ratify the treaty without the support of the Opposition because a two thirds majority is required.  Today's edition of<i>The Irish Times</i> reports that the German opposition is demanding as the price for its support the introduction of a financial transactions tax.  If that is the price of their support, I see a real danger that the big countries, including France, as President Hollande is also in favour, will decide that a financial transaction tax will be part of the funding of the growth package.  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that Ireland, due to the vulnerability of the IFSC, will block any attempt to impose such a tax?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_95">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_111">I do not want to interfere in the process of the French national elections.  I spoke to President Hollande about our situation and about the fact that he has his elections this month.  I do not wish to interfere either in the process of ratification of another country.  As the Deputy is aware, like minded parties in different countries will put forward different views.  However, while there was much discussion at the last European Council meeting about growth and investment, it took place among the 27 member states, rather than the 25 member states that support the fiscal stability treaty.  The growth, investment and stimulus agenda concerns all 27 member states and cannot just be applied to 25 states.  Any decisions on changes to taxes in respect of EU treaties require unanimity, and there was violent opposition at a number of meetings to issues like financial transaction taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I do not wish to speak for the opposition parties in Germany, nor do I wish to interfere in any way in that country's ratification process, and I made that perfectly clear to the Chancellor.  The Spanish assessment, the Greek elections, the French elections and the presentation by the Commission of its medium and longer term proposals are all part of the intensive political discussions now taking place and which will continue for quite some time.  I have already made it perfectly clear that Ireland does not support a financial transaction tax, unless it applied in a global sense and there was no competitive disadvantage applied to the IFSC in Dublin that would not apply in London.  Deputy Ross is aware that 35,000 people work in the IFSC, which is a fundamental part of the economic infrastructure of our country.</p>

These are two major pieces of legislation to institutionalise in EU treaties new funding mechanisms which will have massive implications for European taxpayers and are linked with torturous austerity for ordinary people across Europe.  It beggars belief the Government is proposing the use of the guillotine after only a few hours of debate on both Bills.  These issues should have been the subject of massive national debate in the last two months, but because the Government concentrated on badgering and blackmailing the people in the course of the referendum campaign on access to the European Stability Mechanism-----</p>

In this case the changes are to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty.  Given the fundamental changes included in the Bill, it is imperative that it be thoroughly scrutinised.  The guillotine should be removed and there should be a proper debate.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael, when in opposition, argued, for the same reasons, that debates on substantial and important Bills should not be a guillotined and that time should be allowed for full and comprehensive debates on them.</p>

All the Government is allowing is a few hours of debate on the ESM.  Serious issues are contained within the ESM.

The establishment of a permanent fund to help countries that are in trouble is a welcome mechanism that will be permanent and long standing.  It will help Europe and the eurozone of which we are a member.  I have always been somewhat perplexed by the knee-jerk reaction and negativity towards the establishment of the ESM.

We have spent recent weeks discussing Europe in general on the hustings and the House should be in a position to facilitate a longer debate, if necessary, either today on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which is a specific measure to amend Article 136, or on the ESM Bill proper.  The Taoiseach indicated today that he is in favour of changing the mandate of the ESM in terms of its capacity to lend directly to banks and ailing banks, and that he had suggested such, which is a view held across Europe.  The Minister might clarify the position.  Would it require an amendment, for example, to the proposed Bill that is being put before us tomorrow?  I would welcome a comment from the Minister in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">The Minister was missing in action for several weeks and his reappearance on polling day was telling.  He more or less said to people, "I have not gone away; I will be back."</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Today there are thousands of students sitting the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  Our best wishes go to all of them.  Students who will sit the examinations next year, however, will not have the benefit of the comprehensive career guidance service they have enjoyed in recent years.  One of the most misguided and savage cuts in last year's budget concerned the decision to axe in its entirety the career guidance service which was singled out above and beyond any other teaching service within second level school provision.  There is no point in the Minister for Education and Skills shaking his head.  That is the reality of what happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">Despite the provisions included in the Education Act which underpin and support the provision of a professional career guidance service in the education system, the damage of this budget cut is serious and will undermine the capacity of career guidance teachers to help students in the most challenging times of their lives in the latter half of their second level schooling.  Will the Minister indicate to the House when the education and training boards Bill, the further education and training authority Bill and the education Bill will be published?  Will he utilise the opportunity provided by these Bills to reverse the cut in question?  Will he ensure legislatively that school management and principals will at least provide some semblance of a career guidance service for students, given the savage and discriminatory and selective targeting of the career guidance service in the last budget?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
          <p eId="para_306">At the outset I thank again the Technical Group for affording me some of its speaking time on this Bill, which deals with two key areas of political funding and the chronic under-representation of women in the political system.  We must make strong efforts to bring about improvements in these two areas because of their importance to the system as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">This Bill is a blunt instrument in achieving gender balance.  Any reasonable measure to improve gender balance is right and proper but we must look behind the numbers at the reasons so few women offer themselves for elections in the first instance.  We must also scenario-test the 30% figure.  What if a political party does not have the required 30% of women offering for selection?  Politics is a career and lifestyle choice for women and men, and we must look behind the statistics to see how we can address the structures of a political career and open it for women.  Should we penalise political parties which do not nominate women candidates?  It may be that women do not offer to stand in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">There is a fundamental question about the lifestyle and career demands and constraints of this job.  Women bring their own special and particular perspective to politics and life, not necessarily because of innate talents but because of life experience.  Women are more likely to be carers and, unfortunately, the majority of lower-paid workers are female.  Females are more likely to be close-knit in the community.  The poor gender balance in this Oireachtas has been an historical problem and I would welcome any move to address it.  We must be careful that if this Bill is introduced, it should not make matters worse.  Simply having token female candidates just to comply with legislation could possibly be the greatest insult of all to the mná na hÉireann.  Instead of improving matters, we could make it worse with tokenism.  That would be completely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">As I noted at the outset, we must look beyond the numbers to ask why so few women take up opportunities to stand before the public for election to political life.  Why are women not choosing to become career politicians?  Throughout our history, women who have gone forward for election have been great public representatives and very successful.  They have made a big contribution to Irish political life.  Nevertheless, there has not been proportionate representation over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Are the workings of this House and politics in general so out of touch with the concept of family life that they affect the decisions made by women?  As a rural Deputy I am away from home three nights every week, and even when at home, the 166 Deputies are completely immersed in constituency work.  It is a strange irony that as we debate this issue of gender balance, the role of politician remains the only job where somebody does not receive maternity or paternity leave.  I suggest that we consider in more detail the reasons women are not putting themselves forward for election.  If we can establish what are the barriers, we can rectify the problem, and with natural progression, the number of female Members will rise.  I would welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Much money is required to become a public representative.  Nobody in this House would deny that, and the funding must come from either the candidates' resources or political donations and fund raising.  We require an open and transparent method of showing where the money comes from.  I agree fully with that principle.  Over the full length of this country there are community groups which must provide audited accounts on a yearly basis to the Companies Registration Office or friendly societies.  This same principle should and could apply to all political parties, with audited accounts to be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis.  In the raising of funds, the public wants politicians to be open and straightforward about where the money comes from.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">There is nothing wrong with normal fund raising for political campaigns.  Once the process is transparent, there can be nothing wrong with it.  We must be careful not to bring elitism into politics; this would happen if only people with the resources to run a campaign could become candidates either in local or national elections.  The fact that money is required to run a campaign should not be a barrier to people going before the electorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">With the House of Lords or the system of representation in America, massive sums of money are required and only wealthy people need apply.  That would be awful.  If we consider the people who have represented constituencies at local and national level, we can see examples of great politicians coming from a background of limited means.  If those people had to fund their own campaigns without the benefit of normal fund raising, they may never have been elected to represent constituencies in the first instance.  We should be acutely aware of that issue and we should not go down a road where the only people who could run as politicians are those who would have personal funding for campaigns.  I know one thing from past experience: Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party all have a common denominator.  They would like it to be increasingly difficult for Independent candidates to get elected.  It is well known the larger parties would be much happier if Independent candidates did not exist at all.  There is, however, a place in Irish political life, locally and nationally, for representatives who are not tied to a party.  I have the utmost respect for the party system, the parties themselves and the way they are run, but there is a place in political life for Independent candidates.  That has been proven over the years by Independent Members of this House and of local authorities who did great work locally and nationally for their electorates.  I never want to see a situation where, because of funding, larger parties could squeeze out Independent candidates at local or national level.  It would not be good for democracy or society.  The extra competition and pressure from Independent Members can be seen daily in the Dáil where there are a variety of Independent Members from completely different backgrounds who all bring their own special contribution to this House.  That has worked and I would always want it to be possible for Independent Members to be here, because that is good, right and proper.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I compliment the registrars of electors on the work that is often done unnoticed in every constituency.  They do Trojan work, especially in recent years with so many people coming to Ireland from other countries and registering to vote in local elections.  These people also enjoy the democratic right to cast a vote.  The registrars and enumerators who check who is who are all to be complimented in a special way because they are a key part of our electoral system.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">When speaking about the right to vote, I must point out it is ridiculous that referenda and local and national elections are held at times when it is difficult for students to get home to vote.  I cannot see what the hang-up is for the present Government and previous ones in allowing for voting to take place on a Saturday.  The public buildings are available and the schools that are used as polling stations are closed.  It makes no sense.  Is the Government afraid of allowing young people the democratic right to exercise their vote?  Does the Government wish to exclude them from the system?  Is the Government afraid of a backlash from students?  What is the rationale behind holding elections when students cannot cast their votes?  It is questionable and I would like a direct answer to that query.  It is an issue that arises continually but about which nothing is ever done.  Last week voting took place on a Thursday which deprived young people of the right to vote.  That is wrong and I am completely opposed to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Putting in place a gender balance commitment for political parties, where there will be fines and possible media ridicule if the correct number of female candidates is not run, is the wrong way to go.  I would like to see more women involved in the political system but we cannot force people to do something they do not want to do.  In my local authority, I have seen ladies who were there before my time being joined by younger women and they all made a massive contribution to those local authorities.  They were exceptionally hard working and dedicated to those they represented.  I knew them personally and none of them could have been forced into politics.  They went into politics because they wanted to do it and it was in their blood.  They wanted to be public representatives and had what it took to be good public representatives.  Forcing parties and coercing people into a way of life in which they might not be interested is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The imposition of fines on parties is ridiculous.  It is the wrong way to go about it.  The political system itself and the way the Oireachtas is run is one of the reasons people with young families would consider politics a difficult way of life.  Undoubtedly, the law of averages dictates there are more women in Ireland today who would be excellent public representatives if they wanted to do it, but it is impossible to make someone go into a way of life he or she does not want.  We must be careful about what we are doing with this legislation.  I do not want to pass a Bill that will make the situation worse, and there is nothing worse than tokenism.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I am friendly with people who work in the political party system and I have heard the amounts raised by national collections are falling all the time.  The days of the golf classics, where political parties could raise massive sums, are also gone because people do not have spare cash to support political parties in the way they did in the past.  We must still be able to do that.  It is not beyond the realms of possibility to come up with a system that will be fair to the parties and the Independents while the public will be able to see what is being done is all above board.  Of course, bad things happened in Ireland in the past, as happened in every country when it came to political funding.  We want to get away from that.  I want to ensure this Bill will be acceptable to the public and as we move forward from here, funding of the political system is open, fair and transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I compliment the work of the Standards in Public Office Commission because a new system was introduced in recent years.  I know this from my time as a director of elections on numerous occasions.  One must account for everything in the running of a campaign, including what comes in, what goes out and what happens in the middle.  We were grappling with this in the late 1990s when the new system was introduced.  People are getting better at it because they are getting to know the system better and understand the rules.  I acknowledge, on behalf of politicians and, particularly, directors of elections who are responsible for accounting for the money, the assistance and guidance we received which we needed as we were coming around to a new system.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I thank the Technical Group for giving me time to contribute.  We have to be careful to avoid tokenism to ensure we end up with a system that will be fair to women who want to enter politics and that will not be worse than the current one.  Political funding must be open and transparent.  At the end of every year community groups must provide audited accounts; there is no reason, therefore, that the funding of politicians and political organisations should not be transparent and open to scrutiny because, at the end of the day, when people do their business right, they have nothing to hide or be worried about.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
          <p eId="para_321">I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  First, the House must acknowledge the level of political apathy in Ireland.  My constituency had the highest turnout in the recent referendum, but the figure did not even reach 60%.  When such a high proportion of the people are so disconnected from politics that they do not even show up to vote, it highlights the fact that we have a serious problem.  This is most evident in local elections in which often a candidate can be elected with a few hundred votes and have extensive rezoning powers.  We have had a long discussion about various tribunals and the inappropriate use of powers by local authorities.  When examining how we can address the issues of political reform and the funding of political parties, we have to look fundamentally at the disconnect between the public and the political system.  The local government reform proposals that will, I hope, be brought before the House will address this because the connectivity between the taxes people pay and the representation they receive is hugely important.  The dynamic in local elections is completely different from that on the doorstep in a general election.  Even at this most fundamental level of our governance system where politics start, we are not making that connection properly.  People do not see the connectivity between their vote, the representation they receive, the services provided and the accountability they require.  If it breaks down at local level, it makes sense that the connectivity between the public and politics in a general election will be similar.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The level of voter turnout is a problem in poorer areas, while the lack of political participation is a particular problem among younger age groups.  I wonder about the validity of people only being allowed to vote once they reach 18 years of age.  I acknowledge this issue will be up for discussion in the constitutional convention which I hope will be assembled shortly.  When a young person turns 18 years, it is potentially the first time he or she will be disconnected from his or her community and live away from home.  It is the first time he or she will have the opportunity to vote.  The education system has responded by introducing a new civics course, CSPE, but I am informed by student bodies that it is not extensive enough.  Some strides have been made in the education system to awaken political interest among the student body, but a lowering of the voting age allied with local government reform and making a connection between voting and the responsibilities of local government could change voter and political apathy.  However, there is a sense that there are strokes and corruption in politics.  Comments are made to Members and councillors all the time about brown envelopes and so on.  Anybody who visits the Chamber realises it is particularly dysfunctional and not representative of society.  It reminds me of going to UCD on my first day as a young student and realising some people walked around as if they owned the place because, effectively, they did.  I get the same feeling walking into the Chamber because generations of certain families have served in the House and these Members feel like they own the place.  When I consider that 87% of the membership is male, it makes me realise something is wrong.  Only three Members are openly gay, which is unrepresentative of the people we are trying to represent.  Almost every Member is exclusively middle class and 100% of us are white.  If we are serious about addressing the issues in the country, the Oireachtas must be more representative of those we are trying to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I attended a report launch yesterday by the integration centre.  The speakers referred to the integration of new communities in Ireland, the stresses and strains in communities and the positive impact sport could have.  They spoke glowingly about the fact that one only had to be resident in Ireland for six months to have a vote in local elections.  That is a positive development, but it is clear that even though 13% of the population are not originally from Ireland, nobody in the Chamber comes from that background.</p>

        <heading>European Council: Statements</heading>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_163">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_326">I am pleased to have the opportunity to brief the House on the outcome of the informal meeting of the European Council on 23 May, especially in the wake of the outcome of last week's referendum.  The decision the people took last week was another positive step on our road to economic recovery.  It was a forward-looking choice that sent a signal well beyond these shores that Ireland was serious about tackling its problems, securing its recovery and charting a clear path to growth.  It removed any lingering doubt about Ireland as a place in which to invest and do business.  It made us more attractive to those looking for locations in which to build their businesses and create jobs.  Ireland already had an excellent offer to make.  The decision taken last Thursday strengthens it further.  It brings greater security, greater certainty and greater confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the steadfastness of the people and the courage and determination with which they have faced up to the exceptional difficulties with which we have had to grapple as a country in recent years.  We have had to take painful decisions which have real consequences in the lives of real people.  It has not been easy for anyone and is particularly challenging for some.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Last Thursday, however, the Irish people stood above the fray and pointed to the type of future they wish to build together with our partners in Europe.  I assure them that the Government is keenly aware of the exceptional burden of responsibility it carries as a result.  As I said throughout the campaign, the stability treaty will not solve all of our problems, but it is one of the foundation blocks on which our economic recovery will be built.  Its endorsement by the Irish people greatly strengthens the Government's hand as we face into another important meeting of the European Council later this month.  Building on the informal discussions that took place last month, that meeting will seek to forge an effective growth agenda for Europe as a necessary complement to the new treaty.  Ireland will be a fully active participant in a process during which critical decisions will be made for all member states, and for eurozone members in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">An urgent part of that agenda must be an effort to stabilise the European banking sector.  It is a fundamental aspect of settling the crisis in the eurozone and something to which this Government is committed to working urgently to solve.  The Irish people have made enormous sacrifices to contribute to the economic recovery of Ireland and of Europe.  I set this out in clear terms when I spoke to the many European leaders who offered their congratulations on the referendum outcome.  I told them that we must urgently turn our collective minds not only to growth but also to ensuring a solution to Europe's banking difficulties and to addressing the related question of debt sustainability.  Ultimately, that must mean severing the link between sovereign debt and banking debt and thus ending the vicious cycle which continues to allow pressure on one to amplify pressure on the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I have no doubt that a comprehensive solution or solutions will be found and that addressing Ireland's situation will be part of that.  We know how difficult - indeed, dangerous - the situation can become when the link between the sovereign and banking debt is allowed to weigh down recovery.  Our national experience of that pernicious link counts for a great deal as we move to contribute to the solution at a European level.  We do not advocate that others follow the path foisted on us.  Experience of the crisis has shown that while Europe does not always move as swiftly as some, including this Government, would like, a consensus is eventually found in favour of progress.  The time for action has arrived.  These problems will only be solved when political leaders face up to the responsibilities arising from the crisis and make political decisions accordingly.  On many occasions we have seen what was previously unthinkable become today's commonplace thinking.  I remain confident that a consensus will be reached on dealing with the banking issues, and I hope it will be reached urgently.  It may involve the European Stability Mechanism or other European institutions.  In any case, it is the result, not the form, that counts, and I will work creatively and constructively with partners to bring about that result.  I assure the House and the Irish people that, together with my colleagues in government, including the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, I will put Ireland's case as strongly and robustly as I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Europe needs a success and Ireland can offer one.  There is a European interest in ensuring our debts are manageable and that our banking burden is acknowledged and addressed.  Last week's decision was a strong and positive one for Ireland which allows us to move forward with a focus on the growth agenda that was the subject of the informal meeting of the European Council on 23 May and which will be the main focus when we meet again at the end of the month.  Discussion at the informal meeting was, as the President of the Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, intended, free and open, although no conclusions were adopted.  The Commission put forward a range of ideas and issues that were discussed and referred to at the meeting, including the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, bank restructuring and a return to normal lending, the adequacy of financial firewalls, and new sources of revenue such as financial transaction taxes, energy taxation and measures to combat tax evasion.  Needless to say, we did not agree with all of these proposals.  There were also proposals regarding steps and conditions for the joint assurance of debt.  In respect of structural reforms, there was a suggestion that member states implement EU recommendations as part of the European semester process, and reference was made to the opportunities arising from the Single Market, the single patent, the digital economy, network industries and so on.  There was also discussion, in reference to targeted investments, regarding Structural Funds, project bonds, a European Investment Bank capital increase, the future budget of the EU and the cohesion and competitiveness agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Although no conclusions were agreed, there was sufficient consensus to enable the President to identify a number of key themes and issues for the discussion ahead.  First, it was clear that all subscribed to the view that actions aimed at growth must complement and not detract from efforts to ensure fiscal consolidation.  There will be no sustainable recovery without sustainable finances.  Second, the process of structural reform through the Europe 2020 process must continue.  Last week the Commission brought forward its most comprehensive assessment yet of where each member state stands and the steps each must now take.  In Ireland's case the recommendation was that we continue to press forward with implementation of our EU-IMF programme.  For many others, the Commission pointed to the need to tackle some very difficult and sensitive issues, including pension and labour market reforms, in the interests of building a sustainable future.  I strongly urge partners to take these recommendations on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Third, the President, Mr. Van Rompuy, identified three pillars of a growth strategy for Europe.  The first pillar is mobilising EU policies to support growth fully, which means making urgent progress on important legislative proposals such as the Single Market Act and the energy efficiency directive.  Plans for implementing the European patent must be finalised by the end of the Danish Presidency.  This is something Ireland has long supported as having the potential significantly to reduce costs for innovative businesses.  The few remaining outstanding issues in this regard must finally be put to bed.  Mr. Van Rompuy also called on colleagues to ensure the full and consistent implementation of existing legislation.  This is an area in which Ireland has been pressing forward, with our most recent results on the Internal Market "scoreboard" the best we have achieved so far.  We are determined to maintain our strong performance in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The second pillar identified by Mr. Van Rompuy is the stepping up of efforts to finance the economy through investments and improved access to credit, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which EU funds can play an important part.  In our discussion, many pointed to the role the European Investment Bank could play and, in this context, it has been asked to consider an increase in its capital for financing projects across the EU by our June meeting.  There was also much discussion of the potential of project bonds, and a welcome for the recent agreement between the Council and the European Parliament enabling the launch of the pilot phase this summer as a first step.  I put forward the proposition that these bonds should apply to projects other than transcontinental infrastructure, that is, that they should be applicable in a national context, subject to appropriate conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Commission is also to report this month on the reprogramming of the current Structural Funds to support growth, jobs and training.  We will also discuss at our next meeting how the Union's new budget, the multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, can be geared to growth and job-creating policies.  I made the case very strongly at the meeting that we live in exceptional times when exceptional measures are needed.  Any new initiatives in the area of financing will be very welcome and will help to create the stimulus Europe needs.  However, they must be focused on those member states that have borne the brunt of the crisis and where they can have maximum impact.  We cannot allow questions of scale and of bureaucracy to determine the shape of our strategy.  There are other issues that arise in this context, including the question of a financial transactions tax, in respect of which I again made the Government's position clear, namely, that we could not support a measure which placed us at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The third pillar identified by the President is job creation.  We must ensure a job-rich recovery in Europe.  The Government has already demonstrated the priority we attach to this agenda through our action plan for jobs and the pathways to work policy.  Mr. Van Rompuy called for greater prominence to be given to national jobs plans in the Europe 2020 process and for better synergy between European and national instruments, including the Structural Funds, with a particular focus on combating youth unemployment.  These issues - mobilising European policies, better financing of the economy and job creation - will be at the heart of our discussions when we meet later this month.  The banking situation will also be part of that agenda.  Our discussion last month also pointed to the need for a longer-term debate about how to take economic and monetary union to a new stage.  The President is currently working with the Presidents of the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Euro Group on what the main building blocks of this might be and how the work should be taken forward.  He will report back on this discussion at our next meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Last month's meeting of the European Council was an important staging post ahead of the one that will take place at the end of this month.  There are vital issues at stake in terms of building economic recovery and securing growth.  Nothing could be more important, here or in Brussels.  Following the outcome in the referendum last week, Ireland is now in a stronger position to advance and defend its interests and the Government will continue to leave no stone unturned in this regard.  We are committed to an Irish recovery and to a European recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">We are committed to a strong and stable euro and to a credible and durable monetary union.  I look forward to participating in a full and active way in the important and critical discussions that lie ahead and I will keep the House fully informed of these discussions as they take place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_339">Will the Taoiseach organise the distribution of an up-to-date text of his speech because there were a number of significant insertions, in particular in the middle after he said there were no conclusions to the summit?  I know we can access the speech later but it would be useful if it could be sent to us.  Clearly, the Taoiseach's speech illustrates how quickly the situation is moving.  Belatedly at the end of his speech, he mentioned that banking would be on the agenda, although the script writer did not have banking as one of the key issues for the next meeting.  The issues were job creation, better financing of the economy and mobilising European policies, and the Taoiseach added the banking situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Over the past year and a half, we have had a steady stream of these European Union statements.  In its contributions, Fianna Fáil has concentrated on making constructive suggestions rather than join other voices on this side of the House who prefer to attack everything and pretend there are easy answers.  We believe this crisis is too serious for the type of politics which the Government used to win votes in the general election and others are now following.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Today, I will again propose specific actions which need to be taken by the leaders of Europe.  However - I have to be quite clear in this - the refusal of the Taoiseach and his colleagues to show any ambition or urgency is becoming ever more stark.  It remains the case that in the 15 months this Government has been in office ,nobody has set out clearly what it is that Ireland is pushing for in Europe.  All we have seen is support for the proposals of others once they look as if they have a chance of being accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The most recent informal summit of EU leaders was another in a long line of meetings where nothing concrete was achieved and Europe's problems continued to mount.  Indeed, the Taoiseach in his speech more or less accepted that when he said there were no definitive conclusions.  Events have already overtaken the empty optimism and vague generalities which the Taoiseach issued when the meeting concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">After four years of emergency meetings, the situation today is that Europe is on the edge of a deeper and more profound crisis.  Last year there was a chance for bold action to keep the eurozone intact and stop the domino effect of countries being driven out of the bond market.  That chance was wasted because of a reluctance to take any bold action.  An incremental approach of doing the minimum possible to get some relief continues to do immense damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Today, it is accepted by nearly everyone that the eurozone will lose at least one member.  The sovereign debt crisis has escalated with Spain and Cyprus requiring help, perhaps as soon as in the next few days, and Italy may shortly follow.  Allied to this, the financial system is again in turmoil with emergency funding being all that is holding it together.  Where last year the issue was maintaining a 17-member eurozone, now the issue is whether we can prevent a lost decade of deflation and unemployment which will be felt far beyond Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">This is no time for sitting back and respecting the niceties of established protocol.  There is an emergency under way which can only be addressed if the leaders of Ireland and Europe take radical and rapid steps.  We need a real diplomatic initiative which reaches agreement within weeks and not the months being signalled.  Specific actions are required to restore the fiscal, financial and employment situation in Europe.  The time has come for Ireland to say unequivocally what it is calling for and for a real diplomatic initiative to be launched behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Last week's referendum gives us real credibility in this task.  We need to follow it up with real action and not just statements targeted at the Irish media.  During one of these debates last year I said that protecting the democratic legitimacy of our engagement with the European Union was absolutely essential.  This legitimacy has been built up over the course of 50 years but will disappear if the people are excluded from important decisions.  For this reason, my party was the first to call for a referendum on the stability treaty, arguing that the Government's preferred route of parliamentary ratification could cause immediate and lasting damage.  Thankfully, the Attorney General was able to convince her colleagues to proceed with a referendum.  While the rushed manner of the vote maximised the risks, the outcome was a decisive one.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Just as important the Irish people have said very clearly they want Ireland to participate in a wider European effort to tackle this crisis.  They have rejected unilateral and isolationist policies and reaffirmed their belief in a Union which has enabled immense progress which remains intact, even today.  They are angry with the failures of Europe's leaders but they still see Europe as the only context in which we can grow and prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">There has been an effort by anti-EU groups to diminish the result by claiming that it was secured by scare tactics.  The same people based their entire campaign on claims that the treaty's passage would lead to a slash-and-burn policy for public services and the end of all national sovereignty.  For some the campaign was just an opportunity to seek political gain, the clearest example of this being last week's High Court case to get publicity rather than address a serious issue.  The people saw through these cynical tactics and passed the referendum by an overwhelming margin.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">During the campaign I spent as much time as possible engaging directly with people in their homes and communities.  I found the thousands of people to whom I talked to be highly engaged with all the issues surrounding the treaty.  They had an instinctive understanding of the need to put aside party politics.  The people have spoken and we need to be careful neither to over-claim or dismiss what they have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The result says three significant things.  It says that Ireland understands the need for a credible mechanism to ensure sustainable public finances over the long term, that we want to have the possibility of accessing EU funding if this is the only affordable way of paying for public services, and that we want Europe to lead a solution to the crisis in which we and many other countries are caught.  As anyone who pays even basic attention to the news can see, the treaty is not capable of solving the crisis by itself.  It is one part of a wider framework.  This treaty should have been accompanied by other measures.  It has been claimed that going first with the fiscal controls is necessary to get others to agree more radical steps.  The time for those steps is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The sovereign debt market for all but a handful of eurozone countries is either closed or becoming unsustainably expensive.  In most cases, this is in no way justified by the fundamentals of the countries concerned.  Britain and the United States of America have higher debt and deficit levels than the eurozone and yet their costs of borrowing are actually falling.  A fundamental design flaw of the euro remains that investors can be unsure about the redemption of their bonds because of the absence of a lender of last resort.  This is driving up risk and effectively closing down the market.  By its secondary market bond purchases, the European Central Bank has made matters worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The only conceivable alternative which can reduce risk and lower the cost of borrowing is for the joint guaranteeing of government bonds.  These have been termed eurobonds and they would mean higher costs for a handful of countries but they would immediately return long-term stability to the market.  The adoption of the stability treaty gives a credible legal foundation for the controls necessary to make eurobonds work.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The financial system is also engulfed in a spiralling crisis and various stress tests did not restore confidence.  It is effectively paralysed and causing immense hardship by refusing to lend to businesses and families.  In Spain and elsewhere banks need urgent funding to stay open.  This is not coming from investors and requests are already being made for EU funding.  Compounding this problem is the fact that there is no uniform framework for winding up failed banks.  As a result, every bank failure brings with it the threat of unknown contagion.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">In so far as it is possible to get agreement on anything, there is agreement that the eurozone desperately needs uniform bank regulation, including a uniform bank resolution regime, a common deposit guarantee modelled on the American system and a central fund to aid the recapitalising of weak but saveable banks.  Even agreeing this in principle would bring immediate relief to the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Unfortunately, every time there is a story pointing to some progress, another quickly follows saying that Germany will not agree.  In regard to desperately needed financial reform, the head of Germany's powerful regional banks wrote at length on Monday about how they think things should remain as they are.  Martin Wolf summarised a growing despair with Germany's position last week when he wrote that its position on the seven main proposals to stop a meltdown in the euro appears to be no eurozone bonds, no increase in funds available to the ESM, no common backing for the banking system, no deviation from fiscal austerity, no monetary financing of governments, no relaxation of eurozone monetary policy and no powerful credit boom in Germany.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Germany is entitled to its views and to assert its position without being faced with the insulting and infantile idea that it is trying to dominate Europe.  However, the German Government and Parliament are profoundly wrong.  A major reason for this is their determination not to relive the country's traumatic past.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Let us be clear: Germany and other countries such as the Netherlands are right when they say the financing of governments by central banks puts upward pressure on inflation.  However, what the inflation hawks are missing is the fact that economic trouble always and everywhere comes from deflation or excessively low inflation.  The hyper-inflation of the 1920s is worth studying, but it has little relevance to the modern economy of Europe or the ability of central banks to fund expansions within safe limits.  Recent research has made the point that extremism was actually fostered during the severe deflation which came later.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">There is no point denying how the German mindset has been scarred by events at a time when money was so devalued that it took a suitcase full of bank notes to buy a loaf of bread.  German monetary orthodoxy served the country well when it had a national currency, but it has not served and is not serving the euro well.  The time has come for Germany to be told very directly that there will either be a radical move on euro level involvement in sovereign bonds or Europe will be dragged into a much deeper and longer economic decline.  It is also time for countries to point out how the euro has directly enabled a large part of the surpluses which Germany is so reluctant to share.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The comment yesterday from Berlin about not setting a precedent by refinancing or reducing Ireland's bank-related debts was depressingly ignorant regarding everything that had happened in the past three and a half years.  It does not indicate that Ireland has put its position forcefully.  Although Ireland has tackled its deficit problems with urgency and great sacrifice by its people, a significant proportion of the bank-related debt was incurred only because of wider European fears of contagion.  These fears are not a feature and the claim that an unacceptable precedent could be set is nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Ministers are wrong in talking about getting ESM funds for bank debts.  This would solidify the debt and simply reduce the interest rate to a reasonable level.  Ireland should not have to carry the debt in this manner.  Given the technical reality that it cannot simply be written off, it can be placed on a level where it places no serious burden on our search for debt sustainability.  If those concerned really want Ireland to show the way out of th crisis, having extremely long terms for this debt and at a negligible rate is the main way they can do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Last year the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste delivered many speeches in Dublin in which they praised themselves for launching a diplomatic initiative.  They never actually got around to doing more than giving these speeches.  We had a ridiculous situation where they claimed credit for an interest rate reduction which was four times what they had asked for and extended to every country.  They have been timid and reluctant to set out a strong position and push for it.  Ireland must stand up and say exactly what it is in favour of and work with others to get it.  When even restrained newspapers are talking about the risk of economic meltdown, there is no time left for hesitation.  The people of Ireland have said they will do nothing to make circumstances worse.  They have shown their desire for the European Union to take a lead.  What we need now are leaders who are capable of rising to the challenge.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
          <p eId="para_362">It is less than a week since the people voted on the fiscal treaty - the austerity treaty.  Almost as soon as the votes had been counted, Government sources began to leak that the Government was seeking a better deal on the bank debt on the back of its referendum victory.  The Taoiseach has told us that he spoke to Ms Angela Merkel on Friday, but he has refused to tell us what she said to him.  Yesterday the spokesperson for the German Finance Minister rejected firmly the Government's advances and said firmly that Germany saw no need for movement.  That is hardly surprising, given the refusal by the Taoiseach to pursue these issues since he took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">One of the critical matters at this point relates to the interpretation of the vote in the referendum.  The Government's European counterparts have interpreted the outcome of the Irish vote as an endorsement of the policies of austerity and bank bailouts.  This is hardly surprising, given the Taoiseach's support for these positions.  The authorities do not realise or perhaps have chosen to ignore the reality that a large section of the citizens in Ireland who voted "Yes" did so through gritted teeth in the face of Government and Fianna Fáil scare tactics.  The strong "No" vote and the acknowledged reluctance of a section of "Yes" voters show that a very large percentage are opposed to the Government's austerity policies and the hand-over of Irish fiscal powers to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">It is up to the Taoiseach to fulfil his referendum commitments to remove the burden of the banking debt from taxpayers and initiate job stimulus projects.  The Government promised jobs, investment and stability, on which Sinn Féin will be holding it to account.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have famously reneged on all of their major election promises and must not do so on their referendum promises.  They should not regard the result as an endorsement of their austerity policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I have said to the Taoiseach before, albeit not in a personal manner, that he needs to stand up for the interests of Irish citizens.  It is not acceptable for him to continue to sit on the sideline in the hope some other state will negotiate a deal from which Ireland could benefit.  For example, the Spanish Government is seeking EU assistance in dealing with its banking crisis to avoid heaping the burden of bad banking debt on the shoulders of its citizens, as Fianna Fáil and the Green Party did in this state.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Taoiseach may recall that Sinn Féin has argued consistently for the banking debt to be kept within the banking sector, separate from sovereign debt.  Until last week, the Taoiseach rubbished this idea.  I welcome his apparent and belated adoption of Sinn Féin policy.  Sinn Féin was the first party in the Dáil to argue that the current level of Government debt was unsustainable.  We all now acknowledge that the debt needs to be reduced significantly.  There is a compelling case for the writing down of bad banking debt.  However, this can only be secured if the Government seeks it and follows up with a very serious political effort in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">In January the Taoiseach told the Dáil that he had never sought a write-down of Irish debt and that we would not have the term "default" written on our foreheads.  At some point he needs to spell out when he changed his position on this issue.  He knows by now that if he does not seek a debt write-down, he will not get one.  He needs to spell out exactly how he plans to convince European leaders to agree to a fair deal for Ireland.  Some proponents on the Government side argue that the Taoiseach does not want to show his negotiating position.  However, he is showing it to us when he says his policy is working and that Ireland can and will play its part, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The informal summit had as its focus job creation and growth.  When the Taoiseach came back with the treaty - I read his speech again - he never once mentioned job creation, despite my challenging him on that occasion.  We have argued consistently for a focus on job creation and growth, which need to be central to the debate.  One cannot cut one's way out of a recession.  The jobs and growth strategy needs to be central to any strategy to deal with the current economic crisis.  I, therefore, welcome the Taoiseach's late-in-the-day conversion to the jobs and growth agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Taoiseach promised clarity during the referendum campaign, but he seems to be arguing that austerity and stimulus can go hand in hand.  They cannot; it is not possible.  It is interesting that throughout the debate the Government has blamed officials at European level for spreading stories, as it did this morning, although it makes full use of officials to engage in spin, as it did last week.  It seems no firm conclusions were reached at the informal summit, as is clear from the Taoiseach's notes, except that the attendees at the crisis meeting agreed to call another crisis meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">In the Taoiseach's statement he pays tribute to the steadfastness of the people.  I agree with him.  We are no mean people.  We have the ability, culture, history, tenacity and determination to survive this crisis.  We have survived worse in our proud history.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Taoiseach notes that this crisis has not been easy for anyone.  That is not true.  The golden circle and the elites are still doing very well indeed.  It is working people, the plain people of Ireland, who are carrying the weight of the Government's policies and the Taoiseach must deliver for them.  He needs to honour his referendum commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The urgent crisis facing almost half a million people in this State, and God knows how many millions across the European Union, is unemployment.  We have the added problem of emigration.  We need to see some urgency from Irish and European leaders in tackling this crisis.  As I stated previously, the Government also needs to remove the burden of banking debt from Irish citizens and it needs to initiate genuine jobs growth initiatives rather than rhetoric, talk of it or the election promise followed by referendum promise.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
          <p eId="para_373">When the Taoiseach spoke to us last before the informal Council meeting he warned that at this Council meeting, "The intention is that we will not at this stage take decisions or draw conclusions."  Why would the Council take decisions, given the current situation where unemployment is sky high across Europe and when there are queues for soup kitchens in many places, not just in Greece?  I would suggest that the inconvenience of a referendum in this State may have had something to do with the reluctance of EU leaders to put their plans down on paper before the austerity treaty was passed here because we were told the treaty was the bad cop that we had to see before we could see the good cop of investment and a growth plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The treaty has been passed and the clear differences in attitude among the less well-off section of our people towards it has been brought to light.  Post the informal Council, is it time to ask the Government to show its hand and state clearly what it is looking for in terms of a growth plan?</p>
          <p eId="para_375">According to a report published this year by the International Monetary Fund, less government spending during periods of economic contraction lowers incomes in the short term and raises unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.  The report's authors reached this conclusion after examining 173 episodes of government-imposed fiscal austerity over the past 30 years, with the average deficit reduction equal to 1% of GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">They found that a 1% deficit cut had the effect of reducing real incomes by about 0.6% and raised unemployment by nearly 0.5%, and it gets worse.  The IMF report also found that in cases where governments chose to pursue austerity programmes instead of deficit spending, income and employment levels frequently did not return to pre-recession levels even after five years.  Recovery was even more painful when multiple countries tried to impose austerity measures simultaneously, as is currently happening in the eurozone, since not every country can devalue its currency to boost exports at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">With that in mind, I suppose we need to get to the crux of the issue.  What is the Government's negotiating position?  What does it regard as an adequate stimulus package to get the Irish economy moving?</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I asked the Taoiseach the following questions on the previous occasion.  Is the Government promoting or supporting an increase in the investment capacity of the European Investment Bank and if so, to what level?  Chancellor Merkel and her Government's submission for the next Council meeting at the end of June amounts to approximately €10 billion for all of Europe.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has talked about a package of €10 billion for Ireland alone, which has a population of less than 1% of the European Union.  If that is the sort of ball park Chancellor Merkel is in, the Taoiseach would need seriously to challenge that.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">I acknowledge the "Yes" side put and won its argument.  That is fair enough.  That is democracy.  However, the Government also has a huge responsibility to deliver.  The Taoiseach will be aware that a considerable section of the Irish people who voted "Yes" did so with gritted teeth and with a concern around future funding.  I understand their concerns.  Their hope is with this renewed chance and mandate that the Taoiseach has been given to go and get that deal once and for all.  This is the moment of truth.  It is here in front of us.  Now we must have a deal on banking debt.  We must have a real strategy for growth and investment.  This will be the Government's litmus test in the next period.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Government has not done negotiating to date and does not stand up for Ireland.  Maybe, for the sake of clarity, the Taoiseach would outline what exactly the Government regards as an adequate stimulus package.  What would be required?  Is it the roll-out of next generation broadband?  Is there a programme of school building?  Are there road projects, such as the A5 road to Donegal and Derry?  What are the projects?  What is the strategy?  How many jobs will be created?  We need to see the detail.  We need to know what the Taoiseach is looking for at European level and what strategic alliances he is seeking to build at European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">We are told the EU master plan has three arms.  The first is the one we know all too well.  It is euphemistically referred to as having "sound public finances".  In reality, what this means is a complete ideological inflexibility to consider anything except austerity as a way out of Europe's economic trough.  It is this policy that has seen the return of mass emigration to Ireland and has left one in two young Spaniards unemployed.  It should be yesterday's policy but new life has been breathed into it in this country by harnessing the fear of the people.  It is the policy adopted from day one of this crisis which, despite its obvious failure, is still somehow being championed by the German Chancellor and foisted upon others under threat of deadly consequences.  This arm of the plan does not work.  We know this because Greece has had a second bailout and Portugal and this country have more or less admitted they will need a second bailout because the first one, and its austerity, did not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">On a side point, one area where the EU has sought to make an impact, at least in terms of the media, is on youth unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I am hopeful that this is one area where the Taoiseach may be able to expand on what initiatives were discussed or will be discussed at June's meeting.  My colleague, Senator Kathryn Reilly, has tried to get some clarity on this, even to the extent of making a freedom of information request.  We need clarity and detail on the Government's strategy in terms of stimulus and bank write-down of debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">We are told that "structural reforms" comprise the second arm of the grand plan.  What are these structural reforms?  We are relying on titbits of information and some guess work.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can enlighten us to what is being proposed here and what position the Government will take.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">What guarantee has he got or is he looking for that this structural reform will not merely be more of the neo-liberal policies favoured by the EU Commission over the last decade?  How is the Government positioning itself to reject any moves towards lowering of wages across the EU in the name of competitiveness?</p>
          <p eId="para_390">How much has civil society, in particular the trade unions, been consulted about these so-called reforms?  Experience has taught us that when this EU Commission speaks of "labour market reforms" workers should worry and organise themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">What does the Taoiseach say to the press speculation that has Germany pushing for further privatisation of state enterprises?  Is this something on which the Government will take a stand or is it on-board with the destruction of the State, asset by asset?</p>

          <p eId="para_395">The European Union and its subset, the eurozone, are at a crossroads.  We must have a debate on where we are going because we are not doing so at the moment.  Currently, we are lunging from one crisis to the next with no overall plan.  We must not sleepwalk into what are potentially the greatest changes to this nation state since its foundation.  It is clear what eurozone countries must do for the currency to survive.  There must be full fiscal and political union, and transfers of wealth to less well-off areas, in other words, a united states of Europe.  This is not new thinking.  It is something people such as Anthony Coughlan, who opposed the euro project, have called for since its inception.  It is also a fact of which anyone with a brain in the newly formed Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour Party alliance was well aware.  This is something the "Yes to every euro referendum" brigade have never admitted.  The implications of such a move are immense.  It would mean the end of Ireland as an independent state in terms of sovereignty, and let no one say otherwise or they are not telling the truth, just as the truth was not told to the people at the time we joined the euro in the first place.  This is why we must debate the issue truthfully, but only if sovereignty means anything to this Government.  The laying of wreaths at memorials for the men and women of 1916 suggests the Government does care.  Its actions in dealing with Europe, however, show the Government is hell-bent on creating servitude rather than sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Angela Merkel wants the currency to survive in such a way as to help the German economy, but its survival appears to do nothing for us.  Germany needs to wake up to this fact and pay the price for the benefits it secures from the euro.  The price is that Germany should subsidise the periphery, something there is no sign of it doing.  The price is also that power should move away from individual nation states such as Germany and France.  There was a time when I believed we were in a union of equals.  We were told during the debate on the Lisbon treaty that if we voted "Yes" we would be at the heart of Europe.  What a joke that seems to be now.  When we look for fairness on bank debt, we are now told by the same people that we are irrelevant and not big enough.  We were meant to be at the heart of Europe.  This is something we were promised by the current Government.  The European institutions have been bypassed and replaced with bilateral meetings and lunches between Germany and France.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">One might have imagined that Mr. Hollande would be different but the first thing he did following his election was to go to meet Angela Merkel.  One might think was the right thing to do but one does not do that in a club.  If two members out of six in my local GAA club had a meeting by themselves, the club would fall apart, and that applies in the case of a GAA club rather than something on which all our lives will depend in future.  Regardless, they meet up and do whatever they want, but not for our benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I believe we should negotiate a withdrawal from a system based on bullying rather than equality.  Unfortunately, however, at a time when we need a strong negotiator we have a Taoiseach who cannot even inspire confidence in a sizeable minority of his party.  At election time we were told by him he would do something about the bank debt.  He has not even bothered to ask.  It says everything that although we have elected a Taoiseach to go and do that for us, the ordinary people in Ballyhea, County Cork, must take up the battle and do it for themselves.  It is the equivalent of a father instructing one of his children to do the shopping and feed the other children while he spends the rest of the day in the pub.  We expected more and I and my children expect more in future.  The Taoiseach must do a better job.  Otherwise he should be prepared for annihilation at the next election.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">Today at 8 a.m. I went to the Capuchin Day Centre on Bow Street on the north side of Dublin.  A queue of people were waiting for food parcels which they get in blue bags.  The Capuchin Day Centre distributes these every Wednesday morning.  I spoke to the man who has been running the centre for many years.  He told me that in 2008, approximately 50 people used to come on a Wednesday morning.  This week approximately 1,400 people will come, almost 30 times more than in 2008.  He said that some children come in their school uniforms and arrive out of breath because their parents are rushing them there from school in order that they arrive before dinner closes.  He spoke of a new poor, including people from the construction industry and self-employed people who have lost their jobs and businesses and who have become homeless.  These people are struggling to pay mortgages and have so little money they cannot feed themselves or their children.  This is what austerity means in Ireland today and this is what we must deal with.  It is not an economic concept.  It amounts to hungry men, women and children on Bow Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Without a deal on the bank debt such austerity will get worse in this country.  In the past two days we have heard from those responsible in Germany that there will be no deal or write-down on the bank debt.  Why is this?  Why are the Germans saying this?  What do those in Germany see when they look at Ireland?  They see a country that pays its senior civil servants more than they pay theirs.  They see a country that will award €250 million in pay rises this year while Germany will not.  They see a Government that has agreed spending increases throughout the Civil Service from stationery and travel to office rent.  They see a Government which sees paying other people's debts as a badge of honour.  They see a Government that states publicly that it is not seeking a write-down.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Naturally, those in Germany maintain that they will not entertain a write-down of the €75 billion of private debt that the Irish people are being asked to pay off.  Why is this?  The Government has failed to make the hard political decisions.  The soup kitchen on Bow Street has not seen even a €1 increase in its funding in recent years.  Funding has been pulled from severely physically and mentally disabled youth in Wicklow.  Under the budget, the Government will take 46 times more money from a lone parent with four children than from a high earner with no children, from whom it is extracting €100.  The Government is not increasing higher end income tax because of a misapplication and a misunderstanding of economic theory.  The Government is not getting a write-down because it has not yet earned the credibility to do so by making the necessary tough decisions.  When the central European powers refer to Ireland, as they did yesterday at a European finance committee meeting, they refer to high wages and to our being bailed out by them.  They do not refer to soup kitchens or the €60,000 that every Irish household is paying to the European banking system to stabilise it.  The Government must up its game and change the conversation.  It must change the view held by the central European powers about what is going on here and what is at stake.  We owe it to the people and to the growing numbers in the queues on Bow Street on Wednesday mornings.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">I am pleased to be able to speak on this motion.  I acknowledge the people voted last week for whatever reason, whether because of fear or otherwise.  Business people, those in employment and others were concerned, rightly, about the future of Ireland in Europe and its future as a country on its own.  The people took a decision that it is better to be in the system rather than outside.  This is why the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, and everyone else should change their stance when they meet European leaders.  We must let them know that we are not simply messenger boys.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We have gained much from Europe since joining the European Economic Community in the early 1970s.  We are now in a crisis and need help.  We must be treated as an equal, rather than as lap-dogs to be given a pat on the head during photo-calls.  This morning, the Taoiseach failed to answer a question on what Chancellor Merkel said to him in a telephone conversation.  Did her words reflect the adage we have in Tipperary, namely, "Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi go raibh fear i dTiobraid Árann a bhfuil póca ina léine aige"?  That is no good any more.  Is he saying that dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi go raibh fear i gContae Maigh Eo that has a pocket in his shirt?  The pockets of Irish people are empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I will not relate more of the types of stories told by previous speakers.  I meet people every day in my clinic, socially or on the streets who tell me they are suffering more than they can bear.  Young people are being driven to emigration, while the lifeblood is being drained from businesses.  People are also worried about their pensions and with good reason.  Ireland must be treated fairly and that will not be the case until such time as we stand up to Chancellor Merkel and company.  We must gain our rightful place among European nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Some months ago, a number of colleagues and I met representatives of the troika.  I was shocked to learn they believed everything was grand in Ireland and the electorate had given the Government a mandate for its actions.  The Government was elected on promises to do the opposite of what the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government did.  In the Tánaiste's eyes fire was not hot enough to burn the bondholders.  As the old saying goes, the bondholders are now laughing all the way to the bank.  People were labouring under false illusions.  The Government should deal with high earners, including senior public servants, and address pensions and other blatantly unfair issues.  I am sure the Germans are well aware of this unfairness.  When our officials travel abroad to meet their counterparts, they are being paid double what others are paid, travel first class and stay in the best hotels.  The time for playing games is over.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The Taoiseach indicated this morning that the forthcoming European summit will be crucial.  The time for talking is over and the Government must take action.  The German and French banks recklessly shovelled money into our banks and regulators in both countries failed.  Half of the debt acquired through the bank guarantee cannot and should not be repaid because it was lent recklessly by foreign banks.  We should agree to repay perhaps half of it over a longer term of 30 years or more.  Ireland is not a bad debtor and will continue to pay its way, as it has always done.  We cannot cope with the albatross of debt around our necks which is choking business and frightening the young and old alike.  Will the soup kitchens we had during the Famine make a reappearance?  We can no longer stand for this.  The Government must show leadership and wear the green jersey.  It must let it be known that while Irish people are proud and reasonable and will play fair, they will not be treated as serfs.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">One of the weaknesses of financial regulators is that they must lie.  Central bankers and treasuries must swear there will not be a devaluation or default until such time as they suddenly agree there will be a devaluation or default.  Each time they lie, they damage their credibility.  However, even as they continue to lie, they must also be trusted to control events behind the scenes.  Trust, however, is in short supply.  Just as our banks lied to secure a bank guarantee and for a long time thereafter, which completely undermined the moral justification for the State stepping in to bail them out, Spain is now in the same boat.  I do not know for how long the Spanish authorities have told us that everything is grand.  Two years ago when Banco Santander was threatening to mount a takeover of another large European bank it was lying about its financial position.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">It no longer makes sense to continue to handle the crisis as it is being handled now.  That the taxpayer must pay for the bad management and business practice of financial institutions is outrageous.  Rather than seeking to obtain funding through the State, Spain is seeking money from the European Stability Mechanism.  I, too, would seek money if I were in Spain's shoes but it would probably be better to seek it from the European Central Bank.  If the banks will not repay the money over a long period, those that are needed should be nationalised.  It is nonsense to continue imposing austerity on the most vulnerable in Europe to try to solve the banking crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The message from Germany in recent days that eurobonds are out of the question as they do not suit the agenda and would give the wrong impression is hard to take.  Speaking on joint guarantees or borrowings such as eurozone bonds yesterday, one individual stated they would give the wrong incentive and reduce pressure on debt laden countries to cut their budget deficits.  Some people will not be happy until countries have been reduced to dust.  According to the unelected President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, Greece must respect its commitments, by which he means the package of pulverising privatisations, tax rises and cuts in jobs, pay and services demanded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for loans which cannot be repaid and are reducing the country to beggary.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Eurozone leaders appear to believe they can resolve the crisis through internal devaluation, an approach that will not work.  Germany is more than keen to remain in the euro.  Based on its annual surplus of €160 billion, it is reckoned that the euro undervalues German exports by 40%.  The reintroduction of the Deutschmark would, therefore, increase the price of German exports by 40%.  Would Germany be able to sell Volkswagen cars in Spain, Italy or Greece for 40% more than the current price?  That prospect is not a runner.  Germany benefits from the current arrangement more than any other country.  Chancellor Merkel argues that borrowers must pay up and sort out their problems.  She may not like it but the lender carries as much responsibility as the borrower.  Until she understands that, we will continue to travel down the wrong road.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">I thank the Minister of State for her work to date.  Will she outline clearly what the Government has proposed to deal with the issue of bank debt?  Has it proposed a write-down of the debt or a lengthy extension of the repayment term at low interest rates?  What response it received?  Was it a "Yes", "No" or "Maybe"?  Those questions combined are my first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">What position has the Government taken on the issue of eurobonds?  I understand a consensus had been reached in Irish political circles that the introduction of eurobonds would be a significant way of dealing with the mutualisation of our sovereign debt.  I listened with interest to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, raising a note of caution on eurobonds when he spoke on "The Week in Politics" programme on Sunday night.  Eurobonds, he said, would be akin to Germany allowing Ireland to use its credit card as we saw fit and, by the same token, Ireland allowing the Greeks to use our credit card to spend money as it wished.  I understood this analogy to be an attempt by the Minister to raise a flag of caution or dissenting view that eurobonds may not be the best way to address this problem.  His argument appears to be that the overarching conditions that could attach to eurobonds, including the requirement it would impose on member states to justify individual borrowing events, would have the potential to be so onerous as not to be worth the candle.  I am paraphrasing, but that is my understanding of what he said.  I would like clarity on the issue.  I do not expect to receive an answer on the other issue, as we did not get one from the Taoiseach earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">I would like the Minister of State to give as clear an answer as possible on the issue of a write-down.  There have been many mixed messages sent and different things have been said by different people.  Is the Government actively looking for a write-down on any portion of the debt, including the bank debt that has become sovereign debt, or is it looking for a restructuring that would essentially lower the debt burden?</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I have listened to German colleagues, the German media and even German parliamentarians who were at the finance committee yesterday.  They all talk a lot about the bailout and the German money which has been made available, thankfully, to this country to help us as part of the troika funding.  However, I never ever hear them recognise the fact that the net flow of money is ultimately out of the country.  We have given a vast amount of money - money that is not coming back - to bondholders, some of which are German and French and so on.  Based on the Minister of State's own experience in the negotiations, is that a predominant position?  Is there a lack of understanding of the fact that in terms of net cash flow,<i>per capita</i> we are bailing out their banking systems to a much greater extent than they are bailing out ours.  Is that understood?  If not, is there anything the Government can do and should be doing about it?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Lucinda Creighton)</from>
          <p eId="para_423">As many of the questions are interlinked, I will try to provide for as much clarity as I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The outcome of the referendum changes matters a little from Ireland's perspective on the debt burden.  I do not wish to overstate it, however, as we have already been criticised in the media and elsewhere for linking the result on Friday with the issue of bank debt.  I do not wish to do that because we have said all along that they are separate issues.  The decision in the referendum was one for the people, but, of course, there is some interrelation.  The "Yes" vote strengthens our hand and changes the way in which the Government is looking at this issue and the way in which we are looking for opportunities.  There will be a period of reflection, both with the Department of Finance and the Economic Management Council, as well in the Cabinet more generally, to see how we can leverage the "Yes" vote to our advantage.  We will be exploring all opportunities in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Deputy Gerry Adams is incorrect that the Spanish have looked for a specific role for the permanent stability fund to recapitalise Spanish banks.  They have not done so.  There have been much speculation and discourse in the media and among politicians here about opportunities this could potentially present for Ireland, but as it has not happened yet, we will have to wait and see.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">We sought leniency and flexibility on the overall debt burden last year, as Deputies are aware.  The Minister for Finance explored the options available with the IMF and our European partners, but it was apparent that there was no entertaining it at that stage.  We did succeed in having the interest rate reducing and the maturities of our loans extended.  The interest rates are almost at rock bottom in terms of how low they can go, which is good news.  We have had this conversation many times and it saves the State about €10 billion.  There has been a burning of subordinated bondholders.  As it has been minimal, I would not like to overstate it, but there has been a certain amount of progress made.  The main priority for the Government in terms of debt sustainability has been dealing with the promissory notes.  I am very optimistic about what can be achieved in that regard.  It is a separate issue from the overall debt burden and the question of banking debt being part of sovereign debt.  However, to deal with the promissory notes, I am very optimistic that the "Yes" vote enhances our opportunities.  I know some believed it might happen before the summer, but I never believed that could happen for the simple political reason that there were elections due to be held in France and Greece.  I always considered there would be a window of opportunity in the autumn and think we will get a deal on the promissory notes.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The promissory notes are the first element.  The second is the issue of banking debt forming part of sovereign debt.  I am optimistic that something can happen in that regard, but I cannot yet be specific about what will happen.  Some 23% of our sovereign debt is private banking debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The speculation about the role of the ESM in dealing with Spanish banking debt is just that, although we would be supportive in giving a role to the ESM in directly recapitalising Spanish banks.  If that were to happen, we would most certainly be looking to have it done for Ireland in the case of at least some of our banking debt, which would make it more sustainable.  We have said all along that our overall sovereign debt is just about sustainable, even though it involves a huge effort.  I know we disagree on that point, but doctors differ.  That is our position and we have been strident in communicating it to the rest of the world.  We want to be seen as a country that is able to meet its obligations and so on.  This brings us back to the issue raised by Deputy Gerry Adams about a default.  It is absolutely clear that we will not default.  This is not a Government which is talking about a default.  We could potentially explore our options, whereby we would not default on our debt, but it would be dealt with in a different manner.  In other words, the ESM would assume or take over some of the debt.  However, that is speculative.  I am trying to be as honest as I can, but I am certainly not making any commitment about a process that is very fluid.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Our position on eurobonds is clear.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I have all said we would be supportive of a eurobonds mechanism.  Ultimately, that is the only solution to deal with debt levels across the European Union, specifically the eurozone.  We have been supportive of this position since long before Christmas and it is finally on the agenda.  While we can deride the outcome of the informal Council meeting two weeks ago and say it achieved nothing, the whole purpose of such an informal Council meeting is to enable to Prime Ministers to come together for a genuinely frank discussion and to put items on the agenda that were previously taboo.  There were other informal summits at which Heads of State and Government came together, but they did not bring the taboo issues to the table.  Therefore, it is a significant milestone that the issue of eurobonds was on the agenda for the first time.  There is range of options; there is not just a one-size-fits-all solution.  There are three proposals from the Commission, while other member states have different proposals.  It is a question of arriving at a eurobonds proposal that is workable and acceptable to all member states.  It is the most important solution to the crisis which would help to inspire confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I disagree with the Deputy who suggested all of this meant we would see a united states of Europe and that we would cede all power and sovereignty.  We have heard of that sort of Armageddon many times.  I do not believe that.  There can be a half-way house.  There are some good articles in<i>The Economist</i> of this week or last week that deal with the various stages and steps.  It is not about a full-blown federation.  One can have federal type solutions to certain elements.  A banking union, for example, is something we would like to see.  A system of eurobonds is something the Irish people and State would like to see.  That does not mean we want a full united states of Europe.  We are not talking about that but we are talking about closer co-operation.  If we want our currency to survive, there has to be closer co-operation.  It is a fact of life.  I think we want our currency to survive.  We had a resounding answer to that question last week when the Irish people voted in significant numbers to save our currency, in effect.  We have a mandate from the referendum vote.  We have a mandate with regard to the debt burden and to negotiating a better deal for Ireland.  We also have a clear mandate to save our currency.  I take that clear message from the outcome of the referendum and I am heartened by it.  It means we can go to the table with clear proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Today's debate is not the last before the Council meeting.  We will be back before the summit at the end of the month.  We will be working on more defined positions from the Government's perspective.  We will be looking at ways to collaborate with other member states to put forward concrete proposals.  Deputies can be assured we will have an opportunity to discuss those in more detail before the summit takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">A Deputy asked if I find, in my dealings with German colleagues, any recognition of a<i>quid pro quo</i> or of the fact there is not a one-way street where Germans pay into the EFSF, EFSM or the soon to be ESM and that Ireland has become a bulwark in terms of saving, and ultimately paying out to, bondholders, including German bondholders.  There is a growing recognition of that but it is a slow process.  The German media do not cover this issue.  I use every opportunity to make this point.  Yesterday, I met a delegation of German parliamentarians from the Bundestag.  I believe they attended a number of committees of which Deputies are members.  We had a full discussion.  We must take every opportunity to make this point.  Delegations from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform have visited the Bundestag.  We must get this argument into their thinking and psyche.  We must do so through the media and the national discourse, and not merely through politicians.  It is difficult and there is, sometimes, a one-sided view of this issue in Germany, unfortunately.</p>

Once the Minister of State knew the "Yes" side would win the referendum vote, how long did it take her to decide the question was one of bank debt?  Before the count, members of the Government had been saying until they were blue in the face that the issue was not one of bank debt.  The people need to know what game the Government was playing with them.  In order to get a "Yes" victory, Government supporters said the referendum had nothing to do with bank debt.  When the "Yes" victory had been achieved, they said it had to do with bank debt.</p>

That situation, along with lack of regulation, caused many of our problems.  News is coming through today that the ECB intends to leave interest rates at the same level.  Who is this for?  Is it for us, who need lower interest rates?  It obviously is not.  Is it for Germany again, which does not want lower interest rates because its economy is booming and chugging along nicely?  What are we getting out of this, when did the Government change its mind and who benefits from maintaining interest rates at their current level?  The Government told us the treaty would be a good thing for us.  It obviously is not.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">With regard to interest rates, the ECB is independent.  It is too autonomous, in my opinion.  It is for the governing board of the ECB to set interest rates.  It is disappointing that the anticipated interest rate reduction did not happen on this occasion.  I expect it will happen next month, at the very latest.  Mr. Mario Draghi has been a revelation in the ECB.  Dramatic strides have been made in providing liquidity to the financial system and preventing the collapse of banks and financial institutions all over Europe which are vital to the continuation of our economic activity.  Mr. Mario Draghi has been a breath of fresh air in the ECB but I look forward to seeing more from the ECB.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">We talk about eurobonds, a banking union and related issues, but we should also be talking about the mandate of the ECB.  This is a sensitive issue and I have raised it with colleagues from other member states.  Suffice it to say they did not leap at the opportunity I presented.  However, this is something we must talk about.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Deputy Flanagan asked when the Government decided to link the referendum to bank debt.  One advocate of a "No" vote, Mr. Declan Ganley, campaigned exclusively on the issue of bank debt.  With Government colleagues, I repeatedly said the route to a better deal on our sovereign debt was to vote "Yes" rather than voting "No", and that a "Yes" vote would strengthen the hand of the Government.  I said that repeatedly.  It is factually incorrect to say we ran away from that discussion during the course of the referendum campaign.  We did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I thank all the Deputies who participated in today's debate.  Clearly, we do not always agree but that is the nature of democracy and it is helpful and fruitful for me to hear from Deputies and to engage in this exchange.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The importance of last month's meeting lay not just in the discussion that took place but also in the groundwork that was laid for the formal decision-making meeting of the European Council that will take place later this month.  As I said, we will be back in the Chamber - the Taoiseach and I and possibly the Tánaiste - in advance of the meeting to have a similar exchange and to have input from Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">As the Taoiseach said at the outset, Ireland now approaches that meeting in a stronger position as a result of the outcome of last week's referendum.  We have argued consistently that budgetary discipline as encapsulated in the treaty must be accompanied by an equally robust and significant growth strategy.  Budget rules alone will not enable us to overcome our difficulties.  In last week's vote the Irish people have sent out a strong message.  We are and will remain strongly committed and responsible members both of the European Union and of the eurozone.  However, the time has come for Europe to address the same energy and drive to the creation of a clear and effective strategy for growth and job creation.  That means progress on a number of key fronts.  We must ensure all Union instruments, especially the Single Market, are fully mobilised.  That means ensuring the high level decisions and orientations offered at European Council level are turned into concrete action at Council level.  That is one of the biggest challenges we face in terms of growth and stimulus.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">If we could simply implement the majority of the decisions that have already been taken we could add 4% or 5% to the GDP of the European Union as a whole.  There is huge potential which is not to be dismissed.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">President Van Rompuy has signalled his frustration at the gap that sometimes exists between rhetoric and delivery, a frustration I fully share.  We must see urgent progress on measures that are regarded as having real potential to contribute to growth and job creation, including the long-awaited European patent and the energy efficiency directive.  Making the most of the Single Market will be an important priority for the Government during our upcoming Presidency.  Europe must also take steps to ensure there is a proper flow of finance into the economy to support growth and job creation.  That means mobilising the European Investment Bank, project bonds and all potential sources, including the Structural Funds, in support of this goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">We are in the throes of negotiating the Union's budget for the period beyond 2014.  Ensuring this is fully aligned in support of our efforts to generate growth and create jobs will be an important task.  We must also ensure a greater focus on the job creation dimension of economic recovery.  The only way a recovery will be sustainable, economically, politically and socially, is if it gets people back to work.  We in the Government have made clear the priority we attach to this through our action plan for jobs and our Pathways to Work programme.  It is long past time for us in Europe to ensure we make the most of the synergies between efforts at national and European level to ensure they are having the maximum effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">As the Taoiseach identified, a wider debate is under way about how we can take economic and monetary union to a new level.  President Van Rompuy will report back to the European Council at the end of the month, following his deliberations with Presidents Barosso, Draghi and Juncker.  I very much welcome this debate, which is an important one to which Ireland is ready to contribute positively and constructively.  However, it should not distract us from the urgent tasks we need to tackle now.  Generating growth is obviously a key priority but so too is overcoming the crisis in Europe's banks and ensuring debt sustainability.  We need a collective approach and a solution that benefits this country.  Irish people have made great sacrifices throughout the crisis in the interests of Irish recovery and European stability, and they deserve enormous credit for this effort.  This is a message we will continue to bring to our European partners in the important debate ahead.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht__Deputy_Jimmy_Deenihan" eId="spk_216">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)  (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_472">I propose to take Questions No. 1 and Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_473">As Deputies will be aware, the Government's public service reform plan which was published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on 17 November contains a number of actions in respect of my Department's remit.  These include the amalgamation of the National Library, the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission; the combining of the National Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, and the Crawford Gallery, while retaining separate identities; a critical review of Culture Ireland; a review of board structures at the National Library and the National Museum, and an examination of opportunities for shared services.</p>
            <p eId="para_474">I underline the value I place on the role of the national cultural institutions which are the custodians of our arts and cultural heritage.  They also have a key role in scholarship and national discourse.  For this reason, €47.25 million was provided for our cultural institutions and bodies in the 2012 Estimates.  The critical role the arts and culture play in attracting tourists to Ireland is also well recognised.  Cultural tourism is a key element of Ireland's tourism industry and the national cultural institutions play a significant role in this respect.  The institutions funded by my Department attracted more than 3 million visitors in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_475">In the overall context of the public service reform agenda, one of my key concerns is to ensure all options are examined in order that the most appropriate implementation approach can be adopted for each institution.  The artistic and curatorial autonomy of the cultural institutions is a major consideration in this regard.  However, all of our cultural institutions are facing difficult challenges in the times ahead, particularly in terms of resources and funding.  Given the difficult economic circumstances, there has been a considerable reduction in Exchequer funding in recent years and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  In this context, it is important that the institutions operate in the most efficient and effective way possible and are seen to provide value for money.  Opportunities for sourcing alternative funding through philanthropy, commercial partnerships and other channels will also need to be sought proactively.</p>
            <p eId="para_476">I see the reform process as offering all concerned a chance to take stock, assess how our institutions are equipped to deal with the challenges facing them and identify the best options to ensure their successful operation in the future.  My Department has been examining the complex issues involved in the various reform proposals.  This process has involved consultations with each of the institutions concerned.  In addition, I have met the chairs of the various institutions involved in the process to afford them an opportunity to express their views on the actions included in the Government's public sector reform plan.  My Department is also considering the various proposals made by the institutions.  There can be little doubt, for example, that the sharing of services, in particular common back office services such as information technology, human resources, marketing and procurement, would lead to savings and efficiencies for the institutions.  If managed properly by them, such a sharing of services could release resources to enhance front-line services to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_477">I cannot accept the proposition that examining reform possibilities amounts to an attack on the cultural infrastructure of the nation, as has been suggested by some.  In fact, the idea that any organisation should be or consider itself to be above examination or review and possible reform is unhealthy and a recipe for a bad deal for the taxpayer who funds these institutions and the public whom they serve.  Engagement between my Department and the cultural institutions on the spectrum of actions set out in the Government's public service reform plan is ongoing and I anticipate that I will be in a position to revert to the Government on these matters shortly.</p>

          <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_217">
            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_478">I thank the Minister for his reply which highlights more concerns, rather than providing answers to these questions.  There is deep anxiety within the arts sector about the proposed mergers of various cultural institutions, the absence of criteria for these reforms and, despite the Minister's remarks, the lack of consultation with stakeholders.  In Fine Gael's pre-election document it promised that the discussion on the arts would be driven up the Government's agenda and that the arm's length principle would be respected.  Is this latest development another in a long list of broken promises?</p>
            <p eId="para_479">The cultural institutions are of systemic importance to our cultural heritage, identity, tourism industry and international reputation.  Recently I attended a conference entitled, Culture and the Economy, which the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, addressed.  She spoke about the importance of our cultural institutions in terms of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union at the beginning of next year.  It is imperative that our cultural institutions retain their autonomy and independence.  Will the Minister commit to leaving the independent boards in place, protecting their autonomy and ensuring qualified directors are left in place in the cultural institutions?  Given their independent nature under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, will he confirm that the public service moratorium does not apply to cultural institutions?  Will he ensure all future directorships in the cultural institutions will be advertised externally?  It is a matter of concern that the position of CEO in Cultural Ireland is only being advertised internally which runs contrary to the Government's commitment in respect of job advertisements.  Will the position be advertised externally?</p>
            <p eId="para_480">The Minister referred to the importance of philanthropy in funding this critical sector.  Does he agree that it would be much easier to attract philanthropists if the independent boards were left in place and the Government stuck to its pre-election promise and retained an arm's length policy, that is, separating cultural institutions from political interference?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_218" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht__Deputy_Jimmy_Deenihan">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_481">Many of the issues raised by the Deputy will be considered when we make our final decision.  My officials are engaged in consultations and will submit proposals to me in approximately two weeks.  When the Government made the announcement, the Department immediately set up a reform unit, as well as a reform committee to which the unit would answer.  An extensive process is ongoing.  For example, there was consultation this morning.  The information is available to everyone to show the process has taken place.  The fundamental questions raised by the Deputy are being considered.  The process is taking place but I cannot say today to what I can commit.  Artistic and curatorial autonomy is a major consideration for me.  The arm's length approach, evident in the Arts Council's dealings with other bodies, will be taken into consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">The National Archives and Culture Ireland are within my Department.  There was a proposal to make Culture Ireland an independent body but in 2008 it was decided not to do this, and it is still part of the Department.  The contract of the previous chief executive officer, who did a very good job, has expired and the job is now advertised.  There are people working in Culture Ireland who do a good job and are well qualified for that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_483">I thank Deputy Troy for raising these issues and I will certainly consider them.  The overriding factor is that our national institutions, which are important from a cultural and economic point of view, are the custodians of our national treasures and must be protected for the future.  They are looking after our heritage and culture for all our people.  It is important that whatever is done in the future is done for the benefit of these institutions, and whatever actions will be taken will make them more effective to face future challenges.</p>

          <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_219">
            <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_484">Part of me is incredulous that the Minister has come up with this idea, because I know his commitment to the decade of commemorations and his chairing of that committee.  I know his support for our cultural institutions and commemorating our history and I find it difficult to believe this proposal is coming from him.  These are perfectly functioning institutions and he is treating them as if they were broken when they are not.  They have been doing fantastic work since they were set up.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">There are two areas where Ireland's reputation is superb, namely, our development aid budget and our arts and culture.  Instead of this being a cultural discussion, it will be cultural domination.  In 1974, there was an interdepartmental report on the idea of a merger and it came up again in 2008.  The reasons given for not going ahead with it then are still valid today.  The main reason was the disciplines involved are very distinct.  The National Archives has a statutory function which means legislation will be required to deal with any possible merger.  The Minister spoke about consultation but the impression I am getting from people in the arts is that there has been no meaningful consultation.  Why consult if this is almost a done deal and ready to go to Cabinet?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_220" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht__Deputy_Jimmy_Deenihan">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_486">Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised several pertinent issues which I will take on board.  First, this was not my initiative as such.  The Government's public sector reform plan announced on 17 November goes across all Departments and not just the arts.  Several State agencies are being reviewed and not just those under my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_487">The National Archives, in which the Deputy has a particular interest, is within my Department and is functioning well.  If the amalgamation went ahead with the National Library, the National Archives would be taken out of the Department. As nothing has been decided yet, it is not a<i>fait accompli</i>.  I will take a hard look at the proposals coming before me which will then have to go to Cabinet.  Before any final decisions are made, their implications will be considered fully.  I will have to accept them when they happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">I am aware of the concerns about these agencies.  I have a large number of friends working in these cultural institutions with whom I have worked for the past 30 years in various ways before the institutions got independent boards in 2005 and since then.  I am aware of their needs and their future challenges, whether it is more space for archives, digitisation, the use of new technology, attracting funding from external sources or other issues.  I would like if Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan discussed this matter with me further because she has a practical and balanced approach to issues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_221">
            <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
            <p eId="para_489">I thank the Minister for his reply.  As he is aware, the arts sector is extremely resourceful, creative, pragmatic and working well with other stakeholders to agree savings and efficiencies within the arts.  However, there is significant public concern about the threatened undermining of the arm's length principle in cultural decision-making.  Does the Minister accept the arm's length principle will be compromised if the proposal to merge several national institutions results in the demise of their individual boards?  Will he get rid of the boards?</p>
            <p eId="para_490">The principle of independence is vital for the protection of these institutions.  I am glad the Minister has met with the chairs of the various organisations in question.  How does he plan to address the widespread concerns about the lack of information, criteria and consultation in the changes of the status of the arts, culture, archive and museum bodies under his auspices?  Culture Ireland has received great applause both here and internationally.  What are his plans for its future?  Will the position for chief executive officer be re-advertised?  If so, will it be done internally or externally?  Does he agree that if Culture Ireland does not remain independent its powers will become eroded?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_222" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht__Deputy_Jimmy_Deenihan">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_491">The Deputy has asked many questions and I will try to answer as many as I can.  My officials would not agree there has been a lack of consultation or information on amalgamations.  There have been ongoing discussions about amalgamations for several years.  The 2009 budget contained a decision to examine this matter.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan found out, there were consultations.  These have been ongoing over the years.  Now, with the Government's decision on public sector reform plan, there have been further consultations which are extensive and continuing.  Any Deputy can put down a freedom of information request on these discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">As for the criteria, the Government directive was clear in this respect.  It will be the best solution that will matter and the one which I will put to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">Culture Ireland has been very effective since it was established in 2005.  It was originally proposed that it would be a statutory agency but a decision was made against this in 2008.  It has operated effectively within my Department.  It is not an independent agency.  It had a chief executive officer and an independent board, which was not statutory, which made decisions with the executive on grant applications.  When I travelled to America with Culture Ireland, I witnessed its success in making significant connections.  With the various artists who have been supported, there has been an attempt to repair the damaged image of Ireland in Manhattan and on Wall Street.  It could be said the image of Ireland which Imagine Ireland has helped to create is very different from the example from four years ago.  Culture Ireland, through Imagine Ireland, has helped in rehabilitating this image.  I agree that Culture Ireland is very important and I am confident it will retain its dynamic nature and effectiveness.  It will continue to support the arts community, as it has in the past eight years.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">The head of Culture Ireland was very effective; he was an ambassador as much as he was chief executive officer and did a very fine job.  Unfortunately, his contract came to an end and could not be renewed because of contractual arrangements established long before my time.  The position of head of Culture Ireland has been advertised internally, not externally.  I am convinced there are people with experience in the Culture Ireland executive who are adequately qualified to continue the work done by the previous chief executive officer.</p>

He has indicated that this was not his initiative, that it emanated from the public service reform programme, which I accept.  It is, however, his responsibility to protect the arts sector and cultural institutions.  I advise him to work with various stakeholders which are pragmatic and they will formulate ideas on where savings can be made and efficiencies achieved.  The gallery institutions mentioned shared services to him and he should work along these lines.  Will he outline a definite timeframe in order that the people concerned know exactly what the Government plans to do with the cultural institutions?</p>

            <p eId="para_497">It is important to consider international examples which indicate amalgamations do not work.  The process seemed to work in Canada, but there was major investment there.  I am delighted to hear the Minister is not driving this process personally, which suggests he is willing to listen and take on board other suggestions.  With regard to the director of Culture Ireland, it is vital to have the right person in place, as it is an important role.  I hope we will not dismantle the Cultural Institutions Act 1997 which was driven by our new President.</p>

I agree with Deputy Robert Troy about the galleries' submission; the three galleries came together in a positive way to present a good proposal which will be seriously considered and reviewed.  I expect to receive the proposals in two weeks and will then go to the Cabinet.  People will not be left to linger for a long time.  I expect to have the decisions made as soon as possible.  My officials considered the Canadian example, in which $16 million was required for an amalgamation.  There are other examples also in which it was quite expensive.  These are all considerations.</p>

Tá aonad straitéise i mo Roinn freagrach as pleanáil agus feidhmiú na straitéise a threorú.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">Maidir leis an gcoiste Rialtais ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht, bhí cruinniú den choiste sin, faoi chathaoirleacht an Taoisigh, ann inné, 5 Meitheamh 2012.  Tá an chéad chruinniú eile den choiste beartaithe don mhí seo chugainn.  Maidir leis an ngrúpa idir-rannach atá ag feidhmiú faoi mo chathaoirleacht, bhí an chéad chruinniú den ghrúpa ann ar an 8 Feabhra 2012 chun cur i bhfeidhm réimsí sonracha gnímh sa straitéis a bhrú chun cinn ar bhealach comhtháite.  Bhí ionadaithe sinsearacha ó na Ranna ábhartha i láthair.  Beidh an chéad chruinniú eile den ghrúpa ann ar an 27 Meitheamh 2012.  Taobh amuigh de na grúpaí sin, tá trí ghrúpa oibre ardleibhéil bunaithe ag mo Roinnse leis na príomhpháirtithe leasmhara chun dlús a chur le feidhmiú réimsí gnímh éagsúla den straitéis.  Eagraítear cruinnithe de na grúpaí oibre seo, de réir mar is gá.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">Mar thoradh ar chinntí polasaí a thóg an Rialtas ar an 31 Bealtaine 2011 maidir leis na struchtúir fhorfheidhmithe don straitéis agus maidir leis an sainmhíniú nua don Ghaeltacht, tá oifigigh mo Roinnse ag tabhairt tús áite do dhréachtú an Bhille Gaeltachta 2012, a thabharfaidh feidhm, de réir mar is cuí, do na cinntí Rialtais sin.  Tá mé ag súil go bhfoilseofar an Bille Gaeltachta an-luath an mhí seo, faoi réir chead an Rialtais.  Chomh maith leis an obair atá ar siúl ar dhréachtú an Bhille Gaeltachta, ní miste a rá gur fhógair mé dhá thionscnamh shuntasacha faoin straitéis ar an 26 Aibreán 2012.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, chuir mé tús leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht faoina mbeidh plean teanga á ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail do gach ceantar Gaeltachta i gcomhréir leis an straitéis.  Ar an dara dul síos, d'fhógair mé an clár tacaíochta teaghlaigh, a bhfuil sé mar aidhm aige an Ghaeilge a threisiú mar theanga teaghlaigh agus pobail sa Ghaeltacht i gcomhréir leis an straitéis.</p>

            <p eId="para_504">Is le muintir na hÉireann an straitéis 20 bliain, atá bunaithe ar obair a rinne eagraíochtaí Gaeilge ó gach coirnéal den tír, Thuaidh agus Theas.  Tá an straitéis glactha ag chuile páirtí sna Fiche-Sé Contae agus ag an cuid is mó dóibh sna Sé Contae.  Os rud é go bhfuil brú uafásach ag teacht ar an nGaeilge, is rud tábhachtach agus práinneach í an straitéis 20 bliain.  D'fhloglaim muid inniu gur tháinig íslú arís i mbliana ar líon na dteaghlach a fuair an deontas faoi scéim labhairt na Gaeilge.  Le dhá bhliain anuas, tá go leor ráite ag Fine Gael atá glan in éadan an straitéis 20 bliain.  Ag amanna éagsúla, bhí sé mar aidhm ag Fine Gael fáil réidh leis an nGaeilge mar ábhar éigeantach ag leibhéal na hardteiste, deireadh a chur le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, na rialacha maidir le bunú gaelscoileanna nua a dhéanamh níos déine, scoileanna beaga Gaeltachta a dhúnadh, gan ról lárnach a bheith ag an gComhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta sa straitéis agus laghdú a dhéanamh ar cumhachta Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga.  Anois, tá sé ráite go bhfuil buiséad Raidió na Gaeltachta ag íslú.  Ar an taobh eile den scéal, d'fhoilsigh an Aire Stáit pacáiste tacaíochta mar pháirt den chlár teaghlaigh atá bunaithe in áit scéim labhairt na Gaeilge.  Níl sa phacáiste seo ach treoirleabhar a bhí le fáil ó Comhluadar cheana agus dlúthdhiosca éigin.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">Níl ach 13 iarratas curtha isteach chuig an Roinn ag lorg an phacáiste seo go dtí seo.  Cé mhéad cruinniú a bhí ag coiste idir-rannach i mbliana?  An bhfuil an ceart agam go raibh dhá chruinniú ann sa sé mhí seo caite?  Tá faic déanta ag an Rialtas maidir le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge ach amháin rudaí diúltacha.</p>

            <p eId="para_506">Tá an Teachta i ndiaidh tagairt a dhéanamh do rudaí nach bhfuil baint dhíreach ag an Roinn seo leo.  Ní aontaím ar chor ar bith.  Níor tháinig aon athrú ar stádas na Gaeilge san ardteistiméireacht, a mhalairt ar fad a tharla, tá stádas níos láidre ag cumas labhartha na Gaeilge san ardteistiméireacht ná mar a bhí.  Tá 40% ag dul do labhairt na Gaeilge san ardteistiméireacht i gcomparáid leis an 25% a bhíodh ann.  Céim mhór ar aghaidh í sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">Maidir le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, bhí dearcadh coitianta ann nár éirigh léi an aidhm a bhí aici a bhaint amach: cainteoirí dúchais a chothú sa Ghaeilge.  Sé an laige mhór a bhí ann sa scéim ná nuair a cuireadh na páistí faoi scrúdú ar scoil, bhí siad sé bliana d'aois.  Faoin am sin bhí an chéad teanga lonnaithe sa pháiste.  An rud atá i gceist leis an scéim tacaíochta teaghlaigh ná díriú isteach ar na tuisimitheoirí ón am a thagann an páiste ar an saol, fiú sula dtiocfaidh an páiste.  Deir teangeolaithe gur seo an tslí cheart le dul.  Táimid ag déanamh teagmháil le tuismitheoirí sula dtagann an páiste ar an saol, teagmháil leo chomh luath agus a thagann an páiste ar an saol agus ag tabhairt pacáistí dóibh.  An méid atá sna pacáistí a luaigh an Teachta, níl ann ach an chéad chéim agus beimid ag cur leis na pacáistí sin, á méadú agus á bhforbairt sin sna seachtainí amach romhainn.  An aidhm atá againn ná an rogha a thabhairt do thuismitheoirí na nGaeltachtaí, nó d'aon tuismitheoirí eile na buntáistí a bhaineann le clann a thógáil trí Ghaeilge a bhaint amach.  Is í an deacracht mhór ná go raibh titim ar an líon daoine a bhí ag fáil deontas ó scéim labhairt na Gaeilge.  Caithfimid tosnú roimhe sin, caithfimid tosnú leis an pháiste sa chliabhán agus an teanga a lonnú ag an phointe sin.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil an clár seo istigh.  Tá forbairt agus fás le teacht air, seo í an chéad chéim.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">Tugaim aitheantas d'Fheidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte go bhfuil sé sásta agus toilteanach chomhoibriú a dhéanamh linn san fhiontar seo.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">Níl fadhb agam leis an bpácaiste tacaíochta do theaghlaigh; aontaím leis an togra sin, táim ag iarraidh mé féin mó pháistí a thógáil le Gaeilge.  An fhadhb atá ann, áfach, ná nach bhfuil pacáiste ann ag an nóiméad; níl ann ach leabhar a bhí ann cheana féin ag Comhluadar agus dlúthdhiosca éigin.  Níl eolas ar bith ag na tuismitheoirí atá ag iarraidh a gclann a thógáil le Gaeilge.  Praiseach atá ann fós.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé níos fearr sa todhchaí ach níl rud ar bith ann anois díreach chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do theaghlaigh.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">Tá deis an-chuid rudaí a dhéanamh mar gheall air, rudaí beaga nach bhfuil aon chostas ag baint leo, cosúil le beartas luath-thumoideachais iomlán a chur i bhfeidhm sna bunscoileanna Gaeltachta agus ról lárnach a thabhairt do COGG sa choiste oideachais sa straitéis 20 bliain agus aonad náisiúnta pleanála a chruthú dá thoradh.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">Tá tuairim fhorleathan ann anois i measc lucht na Gaeilge go bhfuil an straitéis ar shlua na marbh, nach bhfuil aon treise inti agus nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag obair uirthi.  Tá an t-am ag sleamhnú thart ag an Rialtas agus tá an straitéis ag feidhmiú le dhá bhliain anuas anois ach fós níl aon rud láidir ann chun tacú le daoine.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">Tá an-chuid oibre déanta go dtí seo maidir leis an straitéis.  An clár tacaíochta teaghlaigh, níor láinseáladh é go dtí mí ó shin agus tiocfaidh fás agus forbairt air sin.  Tá suim ag an Teachta sa rud seo ar fad, chonaic mé é féin agus a pháistí nuair a bhí mé i Rath Carn agus an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu.  Mar Aire Stáit sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, tá fáilte agus céad agam d'aon mholtaí fiúntacha, réadúla a thagann isteach chugainn maidir leis an straitéis.  Maidir leis an gclár tacaíochta teaghlaigh, na rudaí atá sa chlár go fóill, tháinig siad ón phobal mar bhí cruinnithe againn.  Má tá moltaí ag an Teachta, nó ag éinne eile, beidh fonn orainn iad a chur sa phacáiste.  Tá seo seolta le mí anuas, beidh suíomh Idirlíne againn agus beidh cead, ceart agus deis ag na tuismitheoirí thart ar an suíomh agus gach saghas eolais a fháil chomh maith.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">Tá ról tábhachtach ag COGG.  Tá fochoiste d'oifigigh ard-leibhéal idir mo Roinn agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.  Bhí COGG istigh cheana féin ann agus bhí Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Foras na Gaeilge istigh lena gcuid tuairimí a chur i láthair.  Níl aon fáth ar an domhan nach mbeidh siad ag teacht isteach arís agus arís eile fá choinne a ndearcadh, a mbarúlacha agus a gcomhairle a thabhairt dúinn.  Táimid go léir ag obair as lámh a chéile, níl aon duine i gcoinne aon duine eile, táimid ag brú an rud ar aghaidh.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">Tá an Bille Gaeltachta réidh le teacht agus táim cinnte go gcuirfear fríd an Teach seo é roimh an samhradh.  Bille an-chuimsitheach é, an chéad Bille Gaeltachta ó 1956, a thabharfaidh cumasú don Stát agus do na Ranna dul ar aghaidh leis an obair thábhachtach i gcur i bhfeidhm na straitéise.  Tá Impleachtaí aige do na Gaeltachtaí agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge agus mar sin.  Tá sé ar tí teacht roimh an Teach.  Is mór an dul chun cinn sin agus tá an obair sin ar siúl ag oifigigh mo Roinne.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 6, 7, 8 agus 28 le chéile.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">I gcomhréir lena bhfuil ráite i gclár an Rialtais, tá sé mar thosaíocht ag mo Roinnse  tacú leis an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm agus tabhairt faoi na spriocanna indéanta atá luaite inti.  Cé go dtréaslaím leis an tionscnamh "Líofa 2015" i dTuaisceart Éireann, a bhfuil sé mar aidhm aige 1,000 duine a spreagadh ó thuaidh chun líofacht sa Ghaeilge a bhaint amach faoin mbliain 2015, ní miste a rá go bhfuil sé mar aidhm againne sa dlínse seo líon na gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge a ardú go 250,000 duine thar shaolré na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">Sa chomhthéacs seo, ba mhaith liom aird na dTeachtaí a tharraingt ar bhearta ar leith a bhfuil tosaíocht á tabhairt dóibh.  D'fhógair mé an clár tacaíochta teaghlaigh ar an 26 Aibreán, a bhfuil sé mar aidhm aige an Ghaeilge a threisiú mar theanga teaghlaigh agus pobail sa Ghaeltacht.  Faoin gclár seo, tá mo Roinnse ag tabhairt faoi 12 beart ar leith chun tacú le teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta atá ag tógáil a gclann le Gaeilge nó a dteastaíonn uathu a gclann a thógáil le Gaeilge.  Mar shampla, tá tús curtha ag mo Roinnse, i gcomhar le Feidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte, le feachtas feasachta chun na buntáistí a bhaineann le páistí a thógáil le Gaeilge a chur in iúl do mháithreacha atá ag súil le páiste nó a bhfuil páiste nuabheirthe acu.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">Tá i gceist ag mo Roinn freisin forbairt a dhéanamh ar scéim na gcúntóirí teanga chun freastal níos fearr a dhéanamh ar pháistí i scoileanna Gaeltachta chun a gcuid Gaeilge a shealbhú agus a shaibhriú.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">Ar ndóigh, tá sé tábhachtach nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ceangailte leis an scoil amháin in intinn an pháiste agus, dá bhrí sin, tá sé beartaithe forbairt a dhéanamh ar scéim na gcampaí samhraidh chun díriú ar raon níos leithne páistí ó thrí bliana d'aois go 14 bliana d'aois, agus béim bhreise a chur ar na gníomhaíochtaí a thacóidh le saibhriú teanga.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">Chomh maith leis sin, tá sé i gceist cur chuige nua a fheidhmiú le déagóirí na Gaeltachta chun cur ina luí orthu gur buntáiste breise í an Ghaeilge dóibh.  Tá sé beartaithe cúrsaí oiliúna faoi leith a chur ar bun do dhéagóirí ón nGaeltacht a bhfuil Gaeilge líofa acu ionas go mbeidh siad ábalta dul ag obair mar chúntóirí sna coláistí Gaeilge.  Tá sé beartaithe fosta tacaíocht a chur ar fáil do na coláistí Gaeilge chun na déagóirí seo a fhostú mar chúntóirí ar chúrsaí Gaeilge faoi scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge de chuid mo Roinnse.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">Maidir leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht, a d'fhógair mé ar an 26 Aibreán, táim ag súil an Bille Gaeltachta 2012 a fhoilsiú go han-luath.  Tabharfar feidhm reachtúil faoin mBille don phróiseas pleanála teanga faoina mbeidh plean teanga á ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail d'achan cheantar Gaeltachta.  Tá sé i gceist faoin bpróiseas pleanála teanga go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht roinnte i 19 ceantar pleanála teanga ar leith.  Bunaíodh na ceantair seo ar cheantair phleanála Údarás na Gaeltachta, ag tógáil san áireamh cúinsí teanga, cúinsí tíreolaíocha, struchtúir pobail agus dlús daonra.  Tá sé cinn de na ceantair phleanála teanga is láidre ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge de roghnaithe cheana féin chun tús áite a thabhairt dóibh maidir le hullmhú pleananna teanga.  Is iad na ceantair atá i gceist ná dhá cheantar i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall, dhá cheantar i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe, chomh maith le Ciarraí Thiar agus na Déise.  Ní mór a bheith soiléir gurb í seo an chéad chéim sa phróiseas agus go bhfuil sé i gceist, de réir a chéile, aghaidh a thabhairt ar an bpróiseas seo sna ceantair phleanála teanga go léir.</p>

            <p eId="para_526">Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire Stáit maidir leis na campaí samhraidh.  Mar a dúirt sé, tá béim á leagadh ar pháistí idir trí bliana agus sé bliana d'aois agus ar scoláirí idir seacht mbliana agus 14 bliana d'aois.  Os rud é go bhfuil níos mó scoláirí i gceist i láthair na huaire, an mbeidh níos mó airgid ar fáil chun an athrú seo a bhaint amach?  An bhfuil aon athrú le déanamh ar an scéim a bhaineann leis na scoláirí a théann go dtí na coláistí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht?</p>
            <p eId="para_527">Dúirt an tAire Stáit go mbeidh an Bille Gaeltachta bunaithe ar an teanga in áit na tíreolaíochta, mar atá an reachtaíocht faoi láthair.  Conas a bheidh an Bille leagtha amach, de réir na straitéise 20 bliana?  Cén fáth nár thug an tAire Stáit cuireadh do na daoine sna ceantair go léir?  Ba cheart go mbeadh muintir na 19 ceantar páirteach, ach níor tugadh cuireadh ach amháin go dtí daoine ó sé cheantar.</p>

            <p eId="para_528">Is cinnte go bhfuil ról an-lárnach agus an-tábhachtach ag na coláistí samhraidh i saol na tíre agus i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tá an-obair á dhéanamh acu agus tabharfaimid gach tacaíocht dóibh as seo amach.  Iarradh orm an ráta céanna in aghaidh an lae a bhí ann anuraidh a thabhairt do na mná tí, atá mar chuid an-tábhachtach d'obair na gcoláiste samhraidh, i mbliana.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta gur tháinig ísliú ar an ráta le cúpla bliain anuas.  Gheobhaidh na mná tí €9.90 in aghaidh an lae le haghaidh gach dalta.  Is toradh maith é sin i gcomhthéacs na ndeacrachtaí atá againn.</p>
            <p eId="para_529">Mar a dúirt mé, beidh ról ag déagóirí na Gaeltachta sna coláistí samhraidh agus sna campaí samhraidh.  Tá an réimse aoise a bhaineann leis na campaí samhraidh leathnaithe againn.  Beidh daltaí idir trí bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois ag freastal orthu.  Cuirfidh sé sin go mór le hobair na gcampa, a bhfuil tionchar mór acu ar aos óg na Gaeltachta.</p>

            <p eId="para_531">Beimid ag breathnú ar an airgead sna Meastúcháin fá choinne é sin a chur i bhfeidhm chomh maith agus is féidir.  Labhair an Teachta mar gheall ar na 19 ceantar pleanála teanga.  Táimid ag tosnú le sé cheantar.  Tá mé tar éis insint cén áit ina bhfuil siad.  Ní fhéadfadh muid tosnú le 19 ceantar.  Níl na hacmhainní pearsanra againn chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Beidh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus dreamanna eile dul amach go dtí na ceantair seo chun cuidiú agus comhairle a thabhairt do mhuintir na háite.  Sa tslí sin, tiocfaidh na pleananna teanga ón phobal féin.  Gheobhaidh siad treoir agus comhairle ón údarás.  Ní féidir linn na 19 ceantar a dhéanamh le chéile.  Déanfar iad ar bhonn céimnithe - anois agus go luath ina dhiadh sin agus arís eile go dtí go bhfuil na 19 ceantar clúdaithe.  Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil siad á dhéanamh ar bhonn céimnithe de réir a chéile.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">Ní féidir breithiúnas a thabhairt ar an mBille Gaeilge ós rud é nach bhfuil sé foilsithe go fóill.  Tá mé ag iarraidh breithiúnas a thabhairt ar an méid ata déanta ag an Rialtas go dtí seo.  Is féidir linn fanacht go dtí go bhfeicimid an reachtaíocht sin, lena bhfuilimid ag súil.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">Tá fadhbanna ag na coláistí samhraidh.  Níl an éileamh céanna ar spásanna sna coláistí samhraidh ann i mbliana, i gcomparáid leis na blianta roimhe seo.  Chuala mé ar an talamh go mbeidh deacrachtaí ag cuid acu na spásanna sin a líonadh, go háirithe i mí Lúnasa seo chugainn.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">Ba mhaith liom níos mó eolais a fháil ón Aire Stáit faoi spriocdátaí na scéimeanna teanga atá luaite aige.  Tá mé ag smaoineamh go háirithe faoin chéad dream lena bhfuil sé ag dul ar aghaidh.  Cén spriocdáta atá i gceist aige chun é a leathnú amach go dtí na ceantair eile?</p>
            <p eId="para_535">D'iarr mé i gCeist Uimh. 8 an bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an togra Líofa 2015 atá á eagrú ag an Aire sa Tuaisceart, Carál Ní Chuilín ó Shinn Féin.  Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, is é cuspóir an togra sin, atá oscailte do chách, ná 1,000 cainteoir nua Gaeilge a chruthú sa Tuaisceart roimh 2015.  Tá an-éileamh ar an scéim.  Is rud iontach é go bhfuil póilíní sa Tuisceart agus duine nó beirt ón DUP agus na páirtithe eile tar éis clárú don togra.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, d'eagraigh Bernard Dunne an feachtas Bród, a bhí cosúil leis an scéim Líofa.  Bhí sé ag iarraidh an méid duine a labhraíonn an Gheilge sa tír seo a leathnú.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil togra den tsórt sin á reachtáil ag an Rialtas?  Tá cumhacht agus airgead ag an Aire Stáit.  Cé gur rud beag é daoine nua a spreagadh chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid, is rud tábhachtach é.</p>
            <p eId="para_537">Cén fáth nach bhfuil togra ar nós Líofa 2016 á chruthú ag an Rialtas chun ómós a thabhairt do na laochra a throid ar son saoirse na tíre seo?  Tá an tAire Stáit i gcónaí ag rá go bhfuil a chluasa oscailte le haghaidh smaointí nua.  Iarraim air inniu tacaíocht a thabhairt do togra ar nós Líofa 2016 sa Stát seo, a mheallfadh an méid is mó daoine agus is féidir chun líofacht a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">Sílim gur scéim mhaith í an scéim Líofa.  De réir mar ata ráite ag an Teachta, tá ag éirí go maith leis.  Tá sé ar intinn ag na húdaráis ó Thuaidh 1,000 duine a fháil a bhfuil fonn acu an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Bhí mé i mBéal Feirste agus i Stormont nuair a rinne an tAire, Carál Ní Chuilín, láinseáil ar an scéim.  Chuaigh sé i bhfeidhm go mór orm.  Bhí réimse leathan den phobal, ó gach taobh agus gach páirtí, i láthair.  Is rud maith é sin.  Céim ar aghaidh a bheidh ann má éiríonn leo 1,000 duine a fháil.  Ar ndóigh, tá sé ar intinn againn líon na gcainteoirí laethúla sa tír seo a ardú go dtí 250,000 le linn na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  Is féidir a rá go bhfuil pleananna níos mó agus níos uaillmhianacha againn i gcomparáid leis an bplean ó Thuaidh.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">Mar Aire Stáit, is cinnte go bhfuil mé sásta aon moladh fiúntach ar bith, ina measc an moladh atá déanta ag an Teachta maidir le 1916, a scrúdú.  Más rud é go gcuideoidh sé liom an Ghaeilge a threisiú i measc an phobail, is fiu éisteacht leis.  Tá pleananna maidir leis an Ghaeilge á ullmhú i gcomhthéacs comóradh 1916.  Bhí an Ghaeilge mar pháirt an-thábhachtach den Éirí Amach don Phiarsach féin.  Tá Conradh na Gaeilge agus eagraíochtaí eile ag scrúdú a gcuid pleananna i láthair na huaire.  Tá an tAire, an Teachta Deenihan, mar chathaoirleach ar an gcomhchoiste céiliúradh atá againn agus tá mé mar leas-chathaoirleach.  Tiocfaidh na grúpaí éagsúla isteach chun cur i láthair a dhéanamh ar na bpleananna atá acu maidir le páirt lárnach a thabhairt don Ghaeilge le linn an chomóraidh.  Tá sé sin beagnach socraithe againn.  Aontáim leis an gcur chuige atá againn.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">Maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh, bhí imní orainn go raibh na figiúrí ag laghdú.  Freastalaíonn idir 24,000 agus 25,000 scoláire ar na coláistí gach bhliain.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh titim tubaisteach ar na figiúrí sin i mbliana.  Tá deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta sa tír seo.  Cosnaíonn sé airgead daltaí a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht, cosúil le gach áit eile.  Is dócha go bhfuil sé sin ag cur isteach ar dhaoine.  Más rud é go bhfuil titim, tá súil agam nach mbeidh sé ró-mhór.  Níos luaithe sa bhliain, bhí imní orainn go mbeadh titim.  Dé réir an scéal atá ag teacht ar ais chugam go neamhoifigiúil, níl rudaí chomh holc agus a shíleamar go mbeidís.  Cífimid de réir mar a théann sé ar aghaidh caidé mar a bheidh sé.  Mar adúirt mé, tá suíl agam nach mbeidh an titim ró-mhór, mar go bhfuil obair chomh tábhachtach sin ar siúl acu.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">Dúirt an tAire Stáit cheana gurb é an chospóir atá ag an straitéis 20 bliain ná an méad daoine le Gaeilge a dhúbailt le linn tréimhse áirithe.  De réir an daonáirimh, tháinig feabhas ar líon na bhfigiúirí atá ag úsáid na Gaeilge chuile lá taobh amuigh den chóras oideachais, ach is feabhas an-bheag atá i gceist.  Tá Gaeilge á labhairt ag 77,000 daoine sa tír chuile lá.  Nílimid chun an chospóir 250,000 daoine a bhaint amach má leanaimid ag an luas seo go 2030.  Caithfimid níos mó daoine a chur leis an bhfigiúr seo.  Caithfimid céim díreach a thógaint ar aghaidh.  Ní leor chospóir a bheith againn ach implementation plan agus timescale a bheith againn chomh maith.  Tá an plean ann.  Ní gá dúinn ach féachaint trasna na Teorainne, agus tá an cumhacht ag an Rialtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">Deireann an tAire Stáit gur ceart moltaí a chur chuige le déanamh.  Táim ag iarraidh anois go sínfeadh sé a lámh trasna an urláir seo inniu agus go n-aontódh sé le seo.  Táim ag iarraidh go mbeadh sé sásta teacht ar ais chugainn agus a rá linn go ndearna an Oireachtas an cinneadh seo agus go bhfuil sé sásta é a chur i bhfeidhm.</p>

            <p eId="para_544">Freagróidh mé ceisteanna an Teachta Tóibín ar dtús.  Gabhaim buíochas lena bhfuil ráite aige.  Beimid sásta suí síos leis an Teachta aon uair agus aon mholadh atá aige a phlé.  Tá mo dhoras oscailte gach lá a bhfuil mé anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Dála an scéil, bhí ceannaire Shinn Féin istigh againn cheana féin, cúpla mí ó shin, le cuid dá chomhghleacaithe agus bhuail mise agus an tAire, an Teachta Deenihan, leis.  Phléamar cúrsaí Gaeilge, cultúrtha agus teanga, agus bhí an-chomhthuiscint eadrainn.  Beidh fáilte roimh an Teachta freisin.  Aon uair a bhím i gContae na Mí, bíonn an Teachta ann.  Tá sé an-díograsach agus dícheallach i mbun a chuid dualgas ansin.  Bíonn fáilte roimhe i gcónaí agus bíonn lúcháir agus áthas orm é a fheiceáil.  Táimid ag lorg moltaí ón bpobal a chuirfidh leis an bplean atá againn 250,000 duine a bheith ag labhairt Gaeilge go laethúil sa tír.  Má éiríonn linn sin é a bhaint amach, beidh mé lán sásta.  B'fhéidir nach mbeidh mé beo nuair a bheidh an 20 bliain suas, ach ar a laghad beidh mé thar a bheith sásta go bhfuil sé bainte amach againn.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">Maidir leis an cheist a chur an Teachta Kitt i dtaobh an scrúdú béil, mar atá ráite agam, thosaigh an ardteistiméireacht inniu leis an scrúdú Bhéarla.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an cinneadh a rinne an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna go mbeidh 40% de na marcanna ag dul don scrúdú béil.  Tá éisteacht, labhairt agus scríóbh sa scrúdú agus tá labhairt na teanga thar a bheith tábhachtach.  Sílim go mbeidh tionchar mór ag seo ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ní fhéadfaí baoite níos fearr a bheith againn le bheith ag tabhairt ar dhaoine an teanga a labhairt ná béim a bheith ar labhairt sa scrúdú.  Is féidir le daltaí altanna agus aistí a scríobh atá de ghlan mheabhar acu, ach tá sé iontach tábhachtach go bhfuil cumas labhartha acu, agus aontaím ar fad le sin.  Beidh sé le feiceáil sna cúpla bliain amach romhainn cad é an feabhas a thiocfaidh ar labhairt na Gaeilge ag an leibhéal sin.  Seo iad na daoine a bheidh ag dul isteach sna choláistí oiliúna le bheith ina múinteoirí, agus tá sé iontach tábhachtach go mbeadh cumas Gaeilge acu fá choinne í a thabhairt don chéad glúin eile.</p>

            <p eId="para_548">Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 9 agus 33 le chéile.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">Bhí 7,000 post, coibhéis lánaimseartha, i gcliant-chuideachtaí Údaráis na Gaeltachta ag deireadh 2011.  Cruthaíodh 734 post nua in 2011 agus, nuair a thógtar líon na bpost a cailleadh san áireamh, bhí glanchaillteanas de 104 post i gceist.  Is í an sprioc fostaíochta atá ag an údarás do 2012 ná 400 post a chruthú.  I rith na bliana reatha, díreoidh straitéis fiontraíochta an údaráis ar thacaíocht a chur ar fáil dá chliant-chuideachtaí reatha agus d'fhiontair atá bunaithe ar acmhainní nádúrtha.  Lorgófar infheistíocht bhreise ó chomhlachtaí nua agus reatha agus cuirfear béim ar leith ar an bhfostaíocht a cailleadh i gceantair áirithe le roinnt blianta anuas a athchur chun an fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht a threisiú.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">Thóg an Rialtas cinneadh polasaí anuraidh go leanfaidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag comhlíonadh a chuid feidhmeanna go ginearálta, an fheidhm fiontraíochta san áireamh.  Chomh maith leis sin, tógadh cinneadh go bhforbrófar meicníocht maidir le comhoibriú idir Údarás na Gaeltachta, Fiontraíocht Éireann agus an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail i gcás tograí suntasacha Gaeltachta a bhfuil poitéinseal ard acu.  Is sampla maith den chomhoibriú sin an infheistíocht a d'fhógair an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail sa chuideachta Bioniche Pharma, in Indreabhán, Contae na Gaillimhe, le déanaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">Ar ndóigh, tá sé mar mhóraidhm ag Údarás na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge a chothú mar theanga pobail sa Ghaeltacht.  Chomh maith leis na scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta atá mar bhunús do straitéis fostaíochta an údaráis, tacaíonn sé le tionscnaimh forbartha pobail agus cuidíonn sé le réimse leathan de thionscnaimh teanga, cultúrtha agus oideachais atá dírithe ar an nGaeilge a neartú mar phríomhmheán cumarsáide i ngach earnáil de shaol an phobail.  I measc na scéimeanna agus na dtionscnamh a chuirtear ar fáil, áirítear: scéim deontas reachtála d'eagraíochtaí pobail; ionaid seirbhísí teanga atá bunaithe ar fud na Gaeltachta; scéim an luathoideachais; scéim Ghaeilge do na naíonraí; agus an tacaíocht a chuirtear fáil don eagraíocht, Óige na Gaeltachta.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">Tá tionchar tábhachtach ag an infheistíocht a dhéanann an t-údarás sna hearnálacha seo ar an bhforbairt pobail agus teanga araon agus cuimsíonn sé a ról i dtaca le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</p>

            <p eId="para_554">Tá na poist atáthar ag cur ar bun thiar ar an Spidéal ag Mylan nó Bioniche Pharma thar a bheith tábhachtach.  Taispeánann sin an chomhoibriú a bhí idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an IDA, go dtáinig an 220 post seo isteach san iarthar agus a rachaidh chun socair go mór don cheantar Gaeltachta sin.  Poist de ard-chaighdeán agus poist an-mhaith ar fad iad.  Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta de shíor ag lorg dreamanna úr le h-infheistíocht a dhéanamh san ceantair Gaeltachta.  Tá siad ag plé le comhlachtaí sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios ag na Teachtaí go bhfuil cuid de na comhlachtaí ag leathnú na fostaíochta atá acu i láthair na huaire, fiú amháin i mo cheantar fhéin.  Tá an t-údarás fite fuaite sna forbairtí sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">Maidir leis na hacmhainní, tá €6 mhilliún de dheontas chaipitil ag an údarás i mbliana, mar a bhí aige anuraidh.  Ba mhaith linn go mbeadh sé níos mó, ach ar a laghad, d'éirigh linn é a choinneáil ag an leibhéal a raibh sé anuraidh.  Deir feidhmeannaigh an údaráis liom go mbeidh ar a laghad €4 mhilliún, €5 mhilliún nó €6 mhilliún eile acu, mar a bhí anuraidh, óna gcuid acmhainní fein.  Táim iontach dóchasach go n-éireoidh leo na 400 post úr atá beartaithe acu don bhliain seo a bhaint amach.  Tá níos mó ná cruthú fostaíochta úr sna Gaeltachtaí i gceist.  Tá sé an-thábhachtach chomh maith go gcoinneofar na 7,000 post lán-aimseartha atá ann cheana.  Tá an t-údarás ag plé leis na gcliant-chomhlachtaí lá i ndiaidh lae le déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil gach tacaíocht le fáil fá choinne na poist atá lonnaithe ansin a choinneáil.  Rud maith é sin.  Is é sin an chéad céim, na poist sin a choinneáil agus ansin poist agus fostaíocht úr a thabhairt isteach.  Ainneoin na deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta agus an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta agus airgeadais, tá mé dóchasach go n-éireoidh leis an údarás an sprioc sin a bhaint amach.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">Go raibh maith agat.  Tá an fhadhb chéanna sna Gaeltachtaí agus atá go forleathan ar fud na tíre.  Chruthaigh Enterprise Ireland sé post breise san iomlán an bhliain seo chaite.  Cailleadh méid mór post an bhliain seo chaite agus an balance a bhí ann sa deireadh ná sé post.  Fadhb mhór í seo.  Tá naoinear ag imeacht ar imirce ón tír gach uair den lá i rith na bliana.  Caithfimid níos mó infheistíochta a dhéanamh agus níos mó airgid a chur isteach chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach.  Cé mhéid de na post sin a chruthaigh comhlachtaí dúchasach agus cé mhéid acu a tháinig ó chomhlachtaí iasachtach?  Tá sé iontach tábhachtach nach ndéanaimid dearmad ar na comhlachtaí dúchasach mar tá siadsan ag fulaingt ag an bomaite seo.  Táimid ag fáil i bhfad níos mó poist ó thar lear - agus is rud maith é sin - ach ní cheart dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh faoi na comhlachtaí dúchasach.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">Chuala mé scéal nach bhfuil aon bhrú ar na comhlachtaí seo daoine le Gaeilge a fhostú.  Mar sin, nuair a thagann comhlacht ó thar lear, is minic a bhíonn daoine le Béarla de dhíth orthu nó á éileamh acu.  Níl aon riail ann go gcaithfidh na daoine atá fostaithe sna comhlachtaí faoi scáth Údaráis na Gaeltachta Gaeilge a bheith acu.  Cad é tuairim an Aire Stáit faoi sin?</p>

            <p eId="para_560">Aontaím leis an Teachta go bhfuil na comhlachtaí dúchasach tábhachtach.  Tagann na comhlachtaí móra isteach nuair a oireann sin dóibh agus go minic imíonn siad ar an gcaoi céanna.  Tá ceangailt níos mó ag na comhlachtaí dúchasach leis an tír.  Ón eolas ar Údarás na Gaeltachta atá agam mar Theachta Dála le 30 bhliain, creidim go dtugann sé aire mhaith do chomhlachtaí dúchasach.  Deirtear liom go neamhoifigiúil go bhfuil níos mó léiriú suime ag fiontair dúchasach anois fostaíocht agus tionscail a chur ar bun ná mar a bhí le tamall anuas, agus is dea-chomhartha é sin.  Tá an imirce againn agus tá an líon atá dífhostaithe, thart ar 450,000, ró-ard.  Is é an prionsabal atá ag an Rialtas agus an chospóir nó an aidhm atá againn ná tabhairt faoi an dífhostaíocht.  Beidh an deacracht eacnamaíochta againn go dtí go n-ísleofar an dífhostaíocht agus is dúshlán mór é.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Ó d'éirigh leis an reifreann an tseachtain seo chaite, sílim go mbeidh muinín níos mó anois ag comhlachtaí idirnáisiúnta i dtodhchaí eacnamaíochta na tíre seo.  Cífidh siad go bhfuilimid ceangailte leis an Eoraip, agus má bhíonn aon deacracht againn, go mbeidh airgead le fáil ón Eoraip.  Tugann sin seasmhacht don tír agus sílim go mbeidh sin ina bhuntáiste d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, don IDA agus daoine eile nuair a théann siad ag lorg infheistíochta ó Mheiriceá nó cibé tír, agus go mbeidh sé níos éasca dóibh an jab a dhéanamh nuair a fheicfear an cinneadh a rinne muintir na hÉireann an tseachtain seo chaite sa reifreann.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">Ceist chasta í sin.  Sílim gur léirigh Údarás na Gaeltachta le blianta anuas go mbíonn fáilte mhór roimh daoine a labhrann Gaeilge a fhostú.  Maidir le cuid de na monarchain a thug mé féin cuairt orthu - is beag ceantar Gaeltachta nár thug mé cuairt air - tá a fhios agam gur bhí agus go bhfuil lúcháir orm a fheiceáil go raibh agus go bhfuil atmaisféar Gaeilge iontu uilig.  Ach ar ndóigh, bíonn eisceachtaí ann.  Nuair a bhíonn post ar fáil ag a bhfuil ard-cáilíochtaí agus scileanna ag baint leis nach bhfuil ag duine sa cheantar nó sa Ghaeltacht, caithfear an duine a thabhairt isteach.  Tarlaíonn sin.  Tharla sé 30 bliain ó shin.  Tugadh daoine isteach a raibh an Béarla acu, ach tá na monarchain ag dul ar aghaidh go fóill.  Mar sin, má théann tromlach na bpost do lucht na Gaeilge, sin mar is ceart é a bheith, ach má tá scileanna speisialta riachtanach agus muna bhfuil siad le fáil sa cheantar, is fearr duine a fhostú a dhéanfaidh an obair, cé acu i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge, fad is go labhrann an chuid is mó de na hoibrithe an Ghaeilge.  Sílim go dtugann an t-údarás aird ar an riachtanas le Gaeilge agus go gcoiníonn sé a shúile ar na hoibrithe atá ag obair i monarchain an údaráis.  B'fhéidir nach mbeadh tionscal ansin ach amháin go bhfuil siad sa Ghaeltacht.</p>

            <p eId="para_573">Bunaíodh an comhlacht feamainne Arramara Teoranta 50 bliain ó shin.  Tá sé faoi lán-úinéireacht ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ó 2006.  Tá 550 bainteoirí feamainne ag soláthar feamainne d'Arramara Teoranta agus tá 17 duine fostaithe sa mhonarchan freisin.  Is beag forbairt atá déanta ag an gcomhlacht sa tréimhse sin ó thóg an t-údarás smacht air.  I mí Mheán Fómhair seo chaite, d'iarr mo chomhghleacaí, an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh, ar an Aire Stáit cad a bhí i gceist ag an Rialtas a dhéanamh ó thaobh infheistíochta de.

Le blianta anuas, tá an-chuid oibre déanta le feamainn ag comhlachtaí ar nós Rí na Mara i gConamara.  Tá deis ag an Rialtas an chomhlacht seo a fhorbairt as seo amach.  Más féidir níos mó táirgí a chruthú agus a dhíol sna margaí thar lear, beidh an comhlacht in ann níos mó daoine a fhostú.  Tá mé buartha nach bhfuil sé mar priority ag an Rialtas.

            <p eId="para_575">Is cinnte gur comhlacht tábhachtach é, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an iarthar.  Sílim go bhfuil beagnach scór duine ag obair sa chomhlacht faoi láthair.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil 500 bainteoirí feamainne, ach tá 250 dóibh ar a laghad.  Tá eolas agam faoin gcomhlacht seo.  Go dtí blianta beaga anuas, bhí cuid de lonnaithe i mo cheantar féin ar an gClochán Liath.  Tá sé lonnaithe go hiomlán i gConamara ó rinneadh cónascadh air.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">Tuigeann Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil féidireachtaí móra ag an gcomhlacht.  Is é sin an fáth gur ghlac Údarás na Gaeltacht sealbhaíocht iomlán ar an gcomhlacht i 2006.  Tuigeann an t-údarás freisin go bhfuil gá le rudaí eile a thabhairt isteach, ar nós saineolas ar chúrsaí feamainne, scileanna, taighde, acmhainní agus infheistíocht.  Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil an t-údarás i dteagmháil le comhlacht eile.  Tá scrúdú á dhéanamh acu ar conas is féidir na riachtanaisí seo a chur ar fáil, sa dóigh is gur féidir linn méadú mór a chur ar líon na ndaoine atá ag cur feamainn ar fáil nó ag obair sa mhonarchan.  Is ar mhaithe le fostaíocht, eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta agus an Ghaeilge atá na cainteanna seo ag dul ar aghaidh.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leo.  De réir mar a thuigim é, tá an próiseas ag dul ar aghaidh.  Mar a dúirt mé, fostaíocht atá i gceist sa deireadh thiar thall.  Is cuma má tá Údarás na Gaeltachta, nó comhlacht ar bith eile a bhfuil na buntáistí seo acu, mar scairshealbhóir iomlán.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná go bhfuil na poist ar fáil.  Má tá infheistíocht breise ag teacht isteach, b'fhéidir as comhlacht idirnáisiunta atá in Albain agus i gCalifornia, cuirfidh mé fáilte roimhe.  Má tá an infheistíocht sin á dhéanamh, caithfidh mé fáilte a chur roimhe.  Tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh an Teachta fáilte roimhe chomh maith.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_579">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important item for discussion today.  My motivation for raising it is to seek an update from the Minister on the Government's efforts to renegotiate the arrangement associated with the IBRC promissory notes, which, as we know, account for approximately €30.6 billion, and, in light of the recent developments in the eurozone, particularly Spain, to negotiate an overall reduction in the burden of bank related debt this State is carrying.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">During the recent referendum campaign, the Taoiseach and Ministers were at pains at every opportunity to emphasise there was no connection between passing the treaty and obtaining a deal on Ireland's bank debt.  However, no sooner were the votes counted than the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers were lining up to say the passage of the referendum would strengthen our case for obtaining a deal on the bank debt.  In the immediate aftermath of the vote, the Taoiseach said the carrying of the referendum sent a message to EU leaders seeking a just deal on Ireland's bank debt.  We have been informed that the Taoiseach raised this issue directly with Chancellor Merkel by telephone last Friday.  However, the overtures by the Government have been flatly rejected publicly today by Mr. Mario Draghi, governor of the European Central  Bank, and in recent days by a spokesperson for the German Finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang Schäuble.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">It is important to return to the issue of the promissory note.  As we know, in March of this year, payment of the €3.06 billion that was due was kicked to touch for 12 months using a convoluted arrangement that involved NAMA and Bank of Ireland, subject to the approval of that bank's shareholders later this month.   However, the Irish Central Bank was repaid the €3.06 billion it was due in emergency liquidity assistance.  However, there is still €28 billion at play in respect of promissory notes, including the €3 billion that was deferred from this year and the remaining €25 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">As far back as September 2011, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, advised us that the Government was in talks with the European authorities about negotiating the promissory note.  In November, reference was made to the preparation of a technical paper.  It is now June 2012 but we have seen no such paper, and we have no timeline for the completion of any such paper.  What is the position on Ireland's efforts to renegotiate the promissory note structure?</p>
            <p eId="para_583">In the Dáil, on 1 February, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in response to a question I put to him, confirmed that the core Government objective was essentially to come up with a new financial arrangement at a lower coupon and over a longer period of time.  Is that the Government's objective?  Is the Government objective to repay this over a longer period of time and at a reduced interest rate or is it to reduce the principal - the face value of the amount of money that is owing?</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The second question is, are the Government's ambitions to renegotiate the banking debt merely limited to the promissory note or is the Government determined to address the remaining €30 billion or so which was invested  in Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the cash reserves of the State which were to hand?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_585">I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this important issue.  I am taking this on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who is on important Government business as we speak.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">The Government is committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, by the previous Government.  The purpose of this review is to determine whether there is a way to reduce the overall cost to the State.  Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration.  The troika has agreed to engage in this process to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">While the development in relation to the end-March promissory note payment, whereby the payment due was settled with a Government bond maturing in 2031, is a positive development, we must keep our eye on the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note and also the potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.  It should be borne in mind also that recent concerns in the eurozone underpin the fact our problems are part of a wider European dilemma and the need for solutions to address the Irish situation as part of an overall eurozone-global solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">It is for these reasons we must look at the recent developments in relation to the promissory note repayment as an initial step to facilitate a project where, if we are successful, it will be in the medium term rather than immediately.  These discussions will continue and the Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC.  The ongoing discussions may also explore options to re-finance the long-term Government bond issued in settlement of the 31 March payment.  We all want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">We support proposals to allow European funds to directly recapitalise banks and will ensure any proposals advanced at EU level will be in the best interest of the Irish taxpayer.  It is too early to make an assessment as to what mechanism will be arrived at ultimately in the potential recapitalisation of the Spanish banking sector or to speculate as to how such mechanisms could, if implemented, be utilised retrospectively to the benefit of the Irish position.  It should be borne in mind that the recent concerns in the eurozone underpin the fact the solutions to address the Spanish situation, as with the Irish situation, should be seen as part of an overall eurozone-global solution.  We will continue to review the proposals that emerge in relation to Spanish bank recapitalisation to ascertain whether any of the proposed measures would have favourable applicability if implemented in Ireland, including whether they could potentially alleviate a proportion of the €62.8 billion cost to the State of the recapitalisation of the Irish banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">While our debt levels are sustainable and we are committed to repaying our debts, the development of an alternative funding arrangement, which would, for example, extend the term of the loan or reduce the costs, would aid our return to the markets in 2013.  This Government has constantly sought to advance proposals that are in Ireland's interest, and our successes can be seen in the interest rate reduction that has saved the State almost €10 billion over the lifetime of the EU loans and the settlement of the 2012 promissory note payment by way of a long-term Government bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The positive result in last week's referendum has been recognised across Europe as good news for the European project, strengthening the eurozone's course to a more stable future.  The referendum result also improves the Government's position in any negotiations that might occur in the further restructuring of the Irish banks, costs incurred to date in the recapitalisation of the institutions or the funding of the assets held by the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">The Government will continue to press Ireland's case for a better long-term solution to our debt problems.  We will continue to monitor developments in the eurozone closely and to participate actively in discussions leading to a sustainable solution to problems facing individual countries and the eurozone.  We recognise clearly that the eventual solution must have regard for Ireland's best interests and the interests of the eurozone.  The House will appreciate it is too early in the process to predict what the eventual outcome might be and, as indicated, it is not envisaged the eventual solution will be arrived at in the short term.  Given the decision-making process in the European Union, it is much more likely a sustainable solution will emerge in the medium term.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_593">The issue is that something will need to be done in the short term with Spain, which has a matter of weeks at most before certainty must be brought to the recapitalisation of its banks.  The problem for Ireland is the absence of clarity as to the negotiating strategy of the Irish Government.  We simply do not know what the Government is seeking.  Is the Government simply looking at tinkering around the edges of the promissory note or is it looking at securing a write-down or writing off of some of the bank related debt?  Those of us in this House and the Irish people deserve to have clarity on the core Government objective in terms of the Irish bank debt.  Certainly, if Spain is successful in securing approval for the ESM to directly recapitalise its banks, something in which I wish it well and which I hope it achieves, there is a compelling case for that to be applied to Ireland in order that equity would be applied across the European Union whereby what is given to one eurozone member is also given to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">Perhaps the Minister of State could give Members a sense of the Government's objective because, during the referendum campaign, we were told it had nothing to do with bank debt and, immediately following the passing of the referendum, we were told the great result strengthened Ireland's case to get a better deal on the bank debt.  What are we looking for?  Are we looking for longer terms and cheaper interest rates or are we looking for a write-down in the amount owing?</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_597">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter and I thank also the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, for being present.  This matter impacts on a small number of students.  Believe it or not, I first raised this on 11 March 1999 and I am back again today on it.  I have been reminded of it because of a specific case, which I do not want to go into, of a young man who is doing the leaving certificate but who is quite ill and may not be able to sit two papers on the same day because he is so ill.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">The debate is a little wider than that.  Some 57,000 students are sitting the leaving certificate this year and I take the opportunity to wish them well.  However, roughly less than 1% of those would be what I would call "crisis" students.  These are students who, during the leaving certificate examination period, either suffer a bereavement or have a serious accident or get seriously ill which prevents them from sitting one subject or a number of subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The suggestion is quite simple, that within four to six weeks of not being able to sit the examination for one of these reasons, these students would be facilitated to sit the examination.  It would not be a re-sit because they would not have sat the exam.  If they were to take part in the original examination process, they would not be able to go ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">I believe the number of students involved would be relatively small, perhaps a few hundred, but it could make all the difference for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">It would mean they would not have to repeat the whole year, something they might have to do if they are not given this opportunity.  The logistics are not too demanding.  Students could go to a regional centre.  There need not be too many regional centres throughout the country.  I imagine four centres would be enough.  Students would be willing to travel.  Teachers and examiners are available.  A back-up paper is available for each subject as well.  All the logistical reasons against doing this can be countered.  It would make a great difference to these students because they would not lose a full year.  Many of these students would have worked remarkably hard but, through no fault of their own, they have been hit with this wall.  I imagine the Minister of State will agree that if, during a leaving certificate examination, a close member of a student's family passes away, whether a parent of a sibling, it is difficult to expect that student to sit the examination.  If that student has worked hard all year and is depending on the points attained in the examination to get a place in college, the choice is to repeat the whole year or settle for something a good deal less than what is merited.  This issue should be considered from a humanitarian point of view.  I realise it is too late for this year but something should be done for next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">Another factor was brought to my attention in 1999 when I first raised this matter.  If we give students no choice but to repeat the whole year and if the issue is a bereavement, then they would sit the examination on the anniversary of the death of a loved one, something we should try to avoid if possible.  The solution I propose will help in many ways.  No great additional cost is involved.  It can be managed easily in an administrative sense.  I call on the Minster to examine the possibility constructively and not to dismiss it out of hand, as occurred in 1999 when I raised the matter previously.  I await the Minister of State's response.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCannon" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_264">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_603">I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 and has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.  Every possible effort is made by the commission, within the limitations of our examination system, to accommodate candidates who suffer illness, bereavement or other trauma immediately before or during the examinations.  Each year, arrangements are made to cater for a wide range of personal emergencies.  These include alterations to the standard examination timetable and special sittings in venues such as hospitals.  The National Educational Psychological Service also assists schools and examination candidates in crisis during examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">The terminal nature of the Irish examinations system, however, imposes some constraints on the degree to which the life experiences of individual candidates can be accommodated.  The issue of repeat examinations was considered prior to the State Examinations Commission's establishment by the Department of Education and Skills.  It was concluded that the constraints inherent in a terminal and externally examined examination system result in significant difficulties in respect of the provision of repeat examinations.  These constraints derive from the length of the school year, the timescale required for holding examinations, providing adequate time for the preparation of marking schemes for repeat examination papers and arranging for the comprehensive briefing and training of examiners, providing ample time for those examiners to conduct the marking to a high standard, the pressing requirement of having results available to feed into the college entry process conducted by the Central Applications Office and college admissions departments in August each year and the need for an appeals system for the review of repeat results.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">The State examinations are run against the tightest of timescales and to maximum capacity in delivering a high quality product at both leaving and junior certificate levels.  It is not possible to hold repeat examinations and have results available to the deadlines required.  Repeat examinations would not accommodate all the life experiences of individual candidates because not all candidates would be able to take the repeat examinations for one reason or another.  Over the years the SEC has dealt with a great variety of individual cases.  In the final analysis, it is difficult to envisage a fair, proper and impartial system of repeat examinations without allowing all candidates to repeat their tests.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">Deputy Stanton may be referring to a specific case.  The Deputy should note that the Minister's office tried to make contact with him today to establish if there are any specific matters which need to be addressed or brought to the attention of the SEC.  I would be pleased to bring to the SEC's attention any specific case which the Deputy wishes to raise.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">I thank the Minister of State for his response.  This issue relates to a small number of students, perhaps fewer than 400.  They could be accommodated in four centres.  The examiners have already been trained and briefed.  I have been an examiner in years gone by.  Most of the points made by the Minister of State can be refuted.  When I brought up this issue in 1999 I received a response which was, almost word for word, the same.  I congratulate whoever in the Department dug out that reply but it is neither here nor there.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">This is an important humanitarian issue which we should make an effort to address and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to do so.  It would not make a great demand on the system.  It would only cater for a small number of students.  It would not be a repeat examination because those involved would not have sat the examination previously because of illness or bereavement.  I call on the Minister of State to use his political good offices.  He should approach the State Examinations Commission and call on it to re-examine this issue and determine whether any change is possible.  If we can help even one student who has suffered a bereavement, who has had a serious illness or accident and who must put his whole life on hold for 12 months through no fault of his own, then we should do so.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_609">The Deputy will be aware that the leaving certificate is a terminal examination, carried out by external examiners.  This contrasts with examination systems in other countries where assessment is conducted on a continuous basis or takes place at regular intervals and where some of the assessment is conducted by the student's teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">It is an inevitable consequence of a terminal, point-in-time system, such as the system we have, that some candidates will take certain tests at a time which they believe to be less than optimum.  Each year the leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations give rise to many situations where real human needs, such as those highlighted by the Deputy, must be balanced by the requirement of equity for the general body of candidates.  This is one of the greatest hurdles to be overcome in putting in place any system along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  However, I would be more than willing to engage further with the Deputy in the coming weeks and to engage directly with the SEC to establish whether we could reassess the decision taken some time ago not to include the opportunity for repeat examinations for children or young people who experience trauma during examination time and to establish if any further progress can be made.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianWalsh" eId="spk_267">
            <from>Deputy Brian Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_611">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this matter, which is of some importance to small businesses, ordinary workers and the Revenue Commissioners.  Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of what could be described candidly as an underhand and damaging practice by which viable companies deliberately accumulate debt before winding up and starting again as a new entity, leaving a trail of unpaid creditors in their wake.  The companies that engage in this practice, in which a debt-free business arises in a new guise from the ashes of a failed entity, are commonly referred to as phoenix companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Necessarily, business ventures entail an element of risk.  It is inescapable that some businesses will fail.  For those who try in business but fail, it is important that supports are in place in order that the risks associated with such ventures do not become so great as to constitute a deterrent against the entrepreneurial spirit which helps to drive and grow our economy.  A clear distinction must be made, however, between companies with a genuine inability to pay their debts and those which deliberately contrive to avoid paying debts.  I am aware of some cases in which companies have closed for business on one particular evening, owing significant amounts of money to the Revenue Commissioners and small businesses among others.  However, the following morning the same directors have opened under the guise of a new company in the same premises debt-free, leaving small suppliers to suffer and leaving the taxpayer to pick up significant bills.  The prevalence of this practice and the extent of its impact on the Exchequer should not be underestimated.  Last year, the business monitoring agency, BusinessPro, calculated that as many as one in 20 new companies showed classic phoenix characteristics, such as common directorships with their failed predecessors.  In many of these cases, pension contributions, wages and moneys owed to small suppliers are left unpaid while accumulated tax bills are left outstanding at considerable cost to the taxpayer.  The problem has been identified to the Revenue and approximately 700 phoenix companies are currently the subject of risk focused monitoring to ensure enforcement measures can be taken expeditiously should issues of non-compliance arise again.  However, monitoring a phoenix company after it has re-formed and jettisoned its debt is to close the stable door long after the horse has bolted.  It is of little consolation to the Revenue Commissioners, unpaid employees who are out of pocket or small suppliers that the unscrupulous directors of a company will find it more difficult to get away with their actions a second time.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">Other regulations that purport to safeguard against the activities of phoenix companies include the requirement under company law of a liquidator to report on the conduct of company directors.  I am aware of cases of collusion between directors and amenable creditors whose debt is exaggerated to secure greater voting rights in the appointment of co-operative liquidators.  In some cases, bogus creditors are created to give stronger voting rights to those who wish to appoint a friendly liquidator.  Such practices could be prevented if, for example, an independent auditor were required to verify the authenticity of invoices pertaining to debts in certain instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">What is certain is that strengthened regulation is required to prevent phoenix type activity by companies in the first instance in the interests of small businesses, employees, ordinary workers and the taxpayer.  In these circumstances, I ask the Minister to consider what legislative options may be open to him to strengthen safeguards against this costly and inequitable practice.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_268">
            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_615">I thank Deputy Walsh for raising this matter.  As the Deputy recognised, company failures while unwelcome are a normal part of business and entrepreneurship.  I suspect he will be aware of some of the information I propose to impart in that I will set out what are the restrictions under company law.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">Company law is based on the essential structure that a company is a separate legal entity from its members and the directors who manage it.  This means a company's profits or losses are its own and are not transferable to the individuals within the company.  This framework means that persons involved in an insolvent company which has been liquidated may lawfully establish another company without the debts of the previous company following them into the new corporate entity.  The importance of this framework is that it encourages investment and entrepreneurship which can lead to the creation of jobs.  Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 provides that the liquidator of an insolvent company must submit a report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, on its demise, together with information on the conduct of any person who was a director of the company during the 12 months preceding its liquidation.  The liquidator must also proceed to apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the insolvent company, unless relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">While there is no definition of the term "phoenix company" in Irish company law, in general it is considered to be a scenario in which directors of a company restart a business in disregard of their duties under company law and their financial and other obligations to one or more of the stakeholders in a previous failed company.  This may occur, for example, by failing to liquidate the previous company and ensuring the payment of debts that can be paid by the previous company.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Phoenix practices are an abuse of separate legal personality and may result in competition in the applicable business market being distorted because the phoenix company enjoys lower than market costs and, therefore, has the potential to achieve an unfair competitive advantage in the marketplace; creditors suffering financial consequences, some of whom may themselves fail in consequence; and directors not bearing any personal liability or otherwise escaping accountability for the failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">The Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 established the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and strengthened the legislative provisions dealing with insolvent companies.  The director has powers to initiate company investigations, prosecutions, restrictions and disqualifications with a view to curbing relevant abusive practices by directors.  The ODCE has been also conferred with certain powers to address unliquidated insolvent companies, namely, those companies which are not in liquidation and have not yet been dissolved.  The legal powers include applying to the High Court for the restriction of the company's directors.  This power has been successfully used to sanction directors.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">The effect of being disqualified is that when such a disqualification order is imposed the person concerned is disqualified from acting as a director, auditor, officer, receiver, liquidator or examiner or being involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company for a period of five years or such other period as the court may direct.  A restriction declaration, if made, prohibits an individual from acting, either directly or indirectly, as an officer of a company or from being involved in its formation or promotion for five years, unless the company is adequately capitalised.  In the case of a private company the capital requirement is €63,487 in allotted paid-up share capital, which must be paid for in cash.  The equivalent figure for public companies is €317,435.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">As the Director of Corporate Enforcement stated in his recently published annual report, insolvent companies abandoned by directors which come to be struck off the register of companies for a failure to file their annual returns continued to receive the attention of his office in 2011.  This category refers to companies which are not in liquidation but which have been dissolved having been struck off by the Registrar of Companies for failing to file annual returns with the Companies Registration Office.  The companies in question may be solvent or insolvent.  In the case of insolvent struck off companies the directors are eligible to be disqualified from acting as company directors.  It is open to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to apply to the High Court for the disqualification of the directors of these struck off companies.  However, the law also provides that the court cannot disqualify a person who demonstrates to the court that the company had no liabilities at the time of strike off or that the liabilities in question were discharged before the initiation of the disqualification application.  In considering the penalty to be imposed, the court may instead restrict the directors where it adjudges that disqualification is not warranted.  In other cases, the former directors are able to satisfy the ODCE that all liabilities had been settled at the time of strike off or prior to the issue of the intended court proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">The giving of credit by one business to another is an essential part of normal business life and facilitates entrepreneurship.  However, creditors must also bear responsibility for protecting their own commercial position and for bringing to account the persons involved in phoenix activity.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement complements these efforts by selecting those cases where particularly serious phoenix behaviour has taken place or substantial public interest may be at stake.  The office welcomes any complaints from members of the public concerning the activities of phoenix companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">In a nutshell, a wide range of powers is available to address the issue of phoenix companies.  Deputy Walsh referred to indications of collusion between directors, creditors and perhaps liquidators and alluded to the possibility of having independent audits.  As his proposal was not anticipated, I will seek a response from my officials to ascertain whether the carrying out of such independent audits in respect of the debts of companies would be practicable.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_624">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and helpful reply.  The main loser in the circumstances I have described is not the small suppliers, although they also incur losses, but the Revenue Commissioners to whom VAT, PRSI and PAYE remain unpaid.  It is galling to see the directors establish new companies immediately after closing phoenix companies.  I am aware of several cases in my constituency of companies closing on one evening and re-opening under a different guise the following morning.  The powers available are clearly not restrictive enough and the provisions of the Companies Acts clearly not sufficient to deter unscrupulous company directors from engaging in the types of behaviour I have described.  The current provisions must be strengthened.  In that regard, it may be necessary for the Minister for Finance to introduce legislation to strengthen the hand of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with the individuals involved in such companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">As I noted the main loser in the case of phoenix companies is the taxpayer who incurs losses as a result of the non-payment of taxes.  Some of the examples referred to me indicate that the moneys not collected by the Revenue Commissioners could amount to tens of millions of euro, which is a significant amount of money.  Steps should be taken to address this issue more comprehensively.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_626">As Deputy Walsh noted, the Revenue Commissioners are monitoring approximately 700 cases.  In 2011 around 70 cases involving more than 100 struck off companies were investigated by the ODCE.  At least 50 were deemed not to be suitable for legal action and remain under investigation.  In the remaining 20 cases disqualification proceedings were initiated or being actively contemplated at year end.  The ODCE obtains a lot of co-operation from many bodies, not just from the Revenue Commissioners, but also from the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency which investigates complaints of non-compliance with registered employment agreements in the construction sector, from the Pensions Board and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman in respect of unpaid pension contributions, and from the Department of Social Protection in respect of outstanding redundancy liabilities.  Information is gathered by the ODCE in an attempt to identify unliquidated insolvent companies or cases of abuse.  The liquidator has the obligation to report company directors within six months of his or her appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The system is designed to catch these cases, but if the Deputy has specific information or proposals that will help to tighten this up, I will certainly have it or them examined.  I will certainly examine whether a role for auditors would help.  Obviously, we have to be conscious of regulatory burdens and obligations; therefore, we would have to assess whether the measure would confer more benefits in catching wrongdoing over the cost that might be imposed on those who are doing their business according to the books.</p>

          <speech by="#AnthonyLawlor" eId="spk_271">
            <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
            <p eId="para_628">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and the Minister of State for being in attendance.  The issue I wish to raise was brought to my attention in my clinics a few weeks ago by an elderly couple who explained to me that they were both in need of regular blood tests because one of them was on warfarin which required regular blood testing, while the other needed blood tests owing to a diagnosis.  They told me that they both had medical cards and that they were being charged by different GPs for having the tests done.  They were both visibly upset when they told me this because they believed they should not be charged for this facility as they both had medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">When they left the office, we conducted some research.  We rang a number of GPs in Kildare and found out that while a few doctors were not charging patients for this facility, a number were charging between €20 and €45, even though it should be provided free of charge.  Doctors claimed they were charging for the service because it was taking time for them to carry out blood tests.  The health correspondent of the<i>Irish Independent</i>, Eilish O’Regan, wrote than in some cases it could take up to 20 minutes to carry out a blood test.  Was blood being taken from a stone?  Other reasons for charging included the cost of transporting blood samples to laboratories.  If a doctor takes five blood samples per day and is charging €40 per patient, for €200 I would pick up the blood samples on my bicycle and bring them to the laboratory.  It seems ridiculous.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">I wrote to the HSE to confirm if the practice of charging for these services was allowed.  It sent me a letter on 17 May.  It stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_631">It is a general practitioner's contractual responsibility to provide proper and necessary treatment to eligible persons.  If part of that proper and necessary treatment, as referred to above, includes routine phlebotomy, the GP must provide that service free of charge under the terms of his or her contract.  The HSE has written to GP contract holders and clarified the position on this matter, and has also communicated the position to the Irish Medical Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">I have also a letter the HSE sent on 20 June 2011 which clearly states GPs should not be charging medical card holders for these services.  There is a response on<i>MediLearning.ie</i> from Dr. Mary Gray, the spokesperson for GPs on the IMO committee.  She stated the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_633">This position was notified to the Department of Health and Children in 2009 and 2010 in IMO submissions on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  The matter was further clarified in correspondence with the Minister for Health and Children ... It was not a matter of dispute between the parties and we therefore strongly reject any suggestion that GPs are acting outside of the terms of the GMS contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">Therefore, the IMO believes doctors should charge for the service, while the HSE believes they should not.  People are at loggerheads and there seems to be no solution forthcoming either from the HSE or the IMO.  This has been ongoing since 2009.  At the end of the day, do we expect patients who have built a long-term relationship with their doctors to ring the HSE and make a complaint?  I find it very difficult to believe.  The direction should come from the HSE.  Those who are suffering are the sick and the elderly, the people for whom we have to care.</p>

          <speech by="#" eId="spk_272">
            <from>Deputy Minister of State at the Department of Health ( Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_635">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because it has come up from time to time in the last year in the House.  I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify the position on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">The current general medical services GP capitation contract was introduced in 1989 and is based on a diagnosis and treatment model.  Section 11 of the contract provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  GPs who hold GMS contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary either to assist in the process of diagnosing a patient, or monitor a diagnosed condition, the GP may not charge the patient if he or she is eligible for free GMS services.  I am very disappointed that a minority of GPs have chosen to charge patients whom the State has deemed to be unable to meet the cost of medical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">This issue was first raised last year.  At my request, the HSE wrote to all GMS GPs on 21 June 2011, reminding them of their obligations under their contract in respect of services such as phlebotomy and advised them that charges should not be applied for such services.  The HSE also pointed out that in many GP surgeries it was the practice nurse who took blood samples and that the HSE significantly subsidised the cost of employing such practice nurses.  I will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure this unacceptable practice is brought to an end.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The HSE is encouraging eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's consumer affairs service.  In a number of cases to date GPs have reimbursed their patients following receipt of correspondence from the HSE.  It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP-patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  I fully appreciate this.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">It is worth reiterating that the programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS contract, with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary primary care teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultations with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements for phlebotomy services will be considered as part of the new contract.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
            <p eId="para_640">I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I note that she has raised this matter on a number of occasions, but the sad fact is that the practice continues.  The Minister of State said it is being continued by a minority of GPs.  I can assure her that the majority of GPs are charging medical card holders for blood tests.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Should a test case be taken against a GP?  I cite the vice-president of the Irish Medical Organisation, Dr. Ronan Boland and Dr. Mary Gray, who has said that the IMO received legal advice that routine blood testing was not part of their contract.  She said if any action were taken against a GP the IMO believed it would be on solid legal ground to defend it.  I believe we should take a test case against one of these doctors and establish whether they have a legal right to charge for this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Do we need to introduce legislation to ensure the HSE contract requires doctors not to charge for blood tests?  Will the new contract referred to by the Minister of State ensure all loopholes such as this are closed?  Patients who are scared and worried do not want to have a conflict with their GPs with whom they have built up long and trusting relationships.  Public representatives such as myself do not want to report GPs on behalf of constituents because this can also lead to a breakdown in trust.  We must ensure this does not happen in the future.</p>

I would encourage the Deputy to take action and to report the names of the GPs who are charging, when they should not be doing so, to the HSE.  If he has a concern about doing that, I would be happy to act as a go-between and to accept reports from him on GPs who have been found to have engaged in this practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">Following the action taken last year, a number of patients have been reimbursed.  I will now give serious consideration to sending a reminder letter to GPs.  I thought the problem had been stemmed.  If that is not the case, I am happy to pursue the matter.  If Deputy Lawlor will forward me the information he has, I will take action on it.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_646">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time".</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I am pleased to introduce the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 following the outcome of last week's referendum.  The history of the European Communities Act itself stands as a reminder of the length and depth of Ireland's relationship with what has become the European Union.  It has served as the means of domesticating each successive treaty in Irish law.  It charts our progress as the Union has widened and deepened.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Our journey in Europe has been a positive one for this country and for its people.  Last week's result takes that journey another step forward.  It has sent, and has been received, as a strong signal that Ireland wishes to remain in the mainstream as a committed member state.  It has underscored our commitment to a strong and stable euro, the currency we share with our partners.  It has strengthened our hand as we face into one of the most important and significant periods in the Union's history.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Throughout the referendum campaign, the Government argued that in Ireland, as in Europe, stability is necessary for growth, and growth is necessary for recovery.  This reality has now been accepted at the highest levels within the Union and developing a growth strategy for Europe will be the foremost item for discussion when the European Council meets later this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Key issues for discussion on that occasion will include mobilising all Union policies, especially the Single Market, and ensuring a better flow of finance into the economy to create jobs and growth, whether this is from the EIB or through project bonds.  We will avail of all possible synergies between action at European and national level to contribute to job creation, with youth unemployment a particular priority for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">An important debate is also taking place on what steps are necessary to restore stability to the euro and to take economic and monetary union to a new stage.  President Van Rompuy is working to identify the main building blocks that will be needed and the best way in which this work can be advanced.  He is doing so in conjunction with the presidents of the Commission, the ECB and the euro group and will report to leaders at the end of the month.  I welcome this forward looking approach.  The time has come to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I hope the collective approach will be both practical and ambitious.  It is very clear that Europe's problems will not be resolved unless and until growth is delivered, until the poisonous link between banking and sovereign debt is severed and until difficulties in the banking system are confronted and dealt with resolutely and credibly.  The outcome of this discussion must be a solution that works for Ireland and that assists our recovery, including in making our bank related debt more sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Throughout the referendum campaign we heard from people of the very real impact the crisis is having on their lives.  People are under real pressure and are worried for their own future and for that of their children.  The Government is very conscious of the high burden of responsibility it carries.  We know that all of the high level discussion in the world is of little value unless it makes a real and tangible difference on the ground for our people, our families and our businesses.  The Government will take last week's result not just as a vote in favour of the passing of the treaty itself, but as a call to redouble our efforts to work for recovery and fresh hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Bill is short and technical in nature, but significant in its import.  The Government published it at the beginning of last month, in line with our explicit commitment to make available, well in advance of the referendum, all legislative proposals that were in any way related to the proposition put to the people concerning the Stability Treaty last week.  It was in full knowledge of the Government's clearly stated intention to legislate for the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to provide that legal underpinning to the ESM, that our people went to the polls on Thursday last.  The Bill, thus, is part of the legislative follow-up to the popular will and solemn decision of the Irish people, as explicitly expressed through last week's vote.  It is all the more important for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The purpose of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 to do a number of important things.  It provides that the Protocol amending the Protocol on Transitional Provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Council decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for member states whose currency is the euro, shall both form part of the domestic law of the State.  If the Bill is passed, these two elements would, upon ratification by Ireland, become a part of the domestic law of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The first element is the protocol on transitional measures on the composition of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The Lisbon Treaty provides for 751 seats in the Parliament, compared to 736 seats previously.  The allocation of these seats under Lisbon increases the number of MEPs allocated to 12 member states, while reducing Germany's allocation from 99 to 96, which is the maximum for any member state.  Ireland's number of MEPs remains unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">This protocol bridges the gap between the existing Parliament which was elected in June 2009 before Lisbon entered into force and that which will be returned in 2014.  The aim of the protocol is to include in the current parliament the additional seats which are provided under the Lisbon Treaty.  In June 2009, 736 MEPs were elected and an additional 18 "shadow MEPs" were given observer status in anticipation of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.  The European Council in December 2008 and June 2009 adopted declarations to the effect that transitional measures were to be adopted as soon as possible to provide legally for the additional MEPs, while not reducing Germany's allocation until the next elections to the European Parliament in 2014.  The protocol was agreed and signed by all member states on 23 June 2010.  Ireland ratified the protocol on 23 November 2010, with the deposit of our instrument of ratification with the Italian Government in Rome.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Following ratification by all EU member states, the protocol entered into force on 1 December 2011.  The entry into force of this protocol thus regularises the position of the 18 "shadow MEPs" and as a consequence the current Parliament exceptionally now has 754 members.  From 2014, the Parliament will revert to having 751 MEPs, as intended in the Lisbon treaty.  The impact of this protocol is thus entirely temporary, however as this protocol represented a change to the EU treaties, a change to the European Communities Act is thus necessary to provide for that change in domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The second element provided for in the Bill to become part of the domestic law of the State is the European Council decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.  Before elaborating on the European Council decision of 25 March 2011 amending Article 136 of the TFEU, I wish to provide the House with some background and context to the decision.  When the economic crisis broke in Europe, and in particular when Greece came under severe pressure in the markets, the EU did not have a rescue mechanism through which loans could be advanced to a member state in difficulty.  Loans to Greece were, therefore, made through a complex set of bilateral arrangements.  That was clearly not a sustainable position.  In June 2010, therefore, the European financial stability facility, EFSF, was established with the aim of preserving financial stability in the euro area.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">It will be recalled by the House that the EU-IMF package for Ireland includes loans to the order of €17.7 billion from the EFSF.  It will also be recalled that loans from the EFSF may be issued only up to June 2013, and that the EFSF is to be liquidated on a date after that when there are no longer loans outstanding.  The EFSF was always intended to be a temporary facility.  In October 2010, the European Council agreed on the need for member states to establish a permanent crisis mechanism.  Difficulties in financial markets led to an acceleration of pace, and the euro group of finance Ministers, at a meeting on 28 November 2010, following a proposal from the Commission, agreed the main features of the future crisis mechanism, to be called the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">At its meeting on 16 and 17 December 2010, the European Council agreed that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be amended to make reference to a permanent mechanism to be established by the member states of the euro area to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  It was agreed that Article 136 of the TFEU be revised by adding a paragraph as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_663">The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole.  The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The meeting of EU Heads of State or Government on 24 and 25 March 2011, adopted the decision amending Article 136 of the TFEU.  The amendment to the TFEU will enter into force when it has been approved by all the member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  The European Council called for the rapid launch of national approval procedures with a view to its entry into force on 1 January 2013.  The amendment of Article 136 of the TFEU will provide a legal underpinning to the ESM, which is to enter into force next month.  Throughout the referendum campaign the Government made clear our strong view that the coming into force of the ESM is very much in Ireland's interests.  It follows logically that providing for the amendment to Article 136 of the TFEU, which underpins it, is also strongly in our national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I note that the ESM Bill itself, which was published by the Minister for Finance, will be before this House tomorrow, as I understand it.  Thus, I do not propose to go into the detail of the ESM treaty or the contents of the ESM Bill.  I do, however, wish to be very clear on a couple of related points that were raised during the debate on the stability treaty.  First, in light of the people's decision of last week, Ireland will now ratify the stability treaty.  Second, through the ESM Bill, we will legislate for the ESM treaty so that Ireland is in a position to have the treaty ratified in time for its entry into force next month.  Third, through the Bill before us today, the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012, we will legislate to provide for the amendment of Article 136 of the TFEU.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">During the referendum campaign we heard a great deal about why Ireland should attempt to veto the ESM, either through failing to legislate for it or through failing to ratify the amendment to Article 136.  That was, and is, nonsense in legal and economic terms.  Early entry into force of the ESM is very much in our interest.  Why would a country in Ireland's position seek to delay a mechanism which will ensure that it has access to future funding, should the need arise?  That makes no sense.  In legal terms, we do not have the capacity to prevent the ESM entering into force; as the House is well aware, the treaty will enter into force once it is ratified by those providing 90% of its capital.  Ireland is providing 1.59%.  We do not, therefore, possess a strong lever, even if we were minded to deploy one.  Through agreeing to ratify the stability treaty last week the people have voted to ensure Ireland will have access to it.  It is the solemn duty of this House, therefore, that their views be respected and fully acted upon as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">As I said at the outset, the Bill before the House today covers two distinct elements.  However, in the interests of the efficient management of business, the Government will propose that it be amended to provide for two other elements when it goes through its Dáil Committee Stage next week.  It might be useful to the House, therefore, to say something about these new elements today.  The first new element will propose that the European Communities Bill be amended also to provide that certain parts of the Croatian accession treaty shall become part of the domestic law of the State, as soon as Ireland ratifies the treaty.  Approval of this amendment will pave the way for Ireland's ratification of the Croatian accession treaty.  The forthcoming accession of Croatia, planned for 1 July 2013, will see the end of the EU integration process for that country; but it will, I hope, also mark the beginning of the accession of all the countries of the Western Balkans.  Ireland is a strong advocate of the enlargement process, particularly as it applies to that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Croatia's journey to membership has been a long one.  In June 2000, at the European Council meeting in Feira, Portugal, the EU confirmed that all the countries of the Western Balkans were potential candidates for EU membership.  The EU-Western Balkans Summit that took place in June 2003 in Thessaloniki, Greece, saw the reaffirmation of this European perspective for the countries concerned.  Croatian accession is proof that the EU holds to its promises, that the process may be complex, difficult, and demanding, but that there is certainty about the outcome.  Ireland has been positively associated with Croatia's accession process from the beginning.  During the Irish Presidency in 2004, this country sought and achieved a single clear decision on granting Croatia candidate status.  The intervening eight years have seen the Croatians undertake onerous reforms in order to bring their legislation in line with the EU<i>acquis</i>.  The <i>acquis</i> has become ever more complex.  Croatia was the first acceding country to have to negotiate specific chapters on rule of law, the judiciary, fundamental rights, justice, and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Negotiations with Croatia were finally concluded at an Intergovernmental Conference on 30 June 2011.  The process of drafting the Treaty of Accession was completed in September 2011 and it was signed in the margins of the European Council meeting on 9 December last.  The Taoiseach signed on behalf of Ireland.  We have now welcomed Croatia into our meeting rooms as an acceding state with active observer status.  That is to allow it to become familiar with the working methods of the EU institutions and to be involved in the decision-making process before its accession.  The process of ratifying the accession treaty has also begun.  Croatia held a referendum in January on EU accession which saw an emphatic result in favour, with two thirds of voters agreeing to Croatia's future as an EU member state.  The Croatian Government proceeded to ratify the treaty on 4 April this year.  A further five member states have also ratified the treaty to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The task of negotiating and agreeing the terms of membership has been a mammoth one.  It involved alignment with tens of thousands of pages of EU legislation.  In the process, Croatia was required to make difficult economic choices and brave political decisions.  Throughout the process, the EU has worked closely with Croatia, measuring its efforts against the exacting conditions of membership.  For our part, Ireland carefully monitored the entire process, especially the conduct of the accession negotiations in policy areas of particular significance to us, such as agriculture, regional policy and institutional questions.  The process is not yet complete and the Commission continues to monitor Croatia's progress, with particular attention to the issues of the judiciary, corruption and privatising the shipbuilding industry.  Decisions will also need to be taken by individual member states, including Ireland, on whether to allow immediate access to our domestic labour markets for Croatian nationals.  However, this is not a matter for decision now.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Croatia's accession will see our European family expand to 28 members.  Croatia's success is the best proof of how strong and successful the transformative power of the enlargement policy can be.  The Croatia that is on the verge of EU membership is different than the country that applied for accession to the EU nearly a decade ago.  Croatia's foreign Minister, Ms Vesna Pusić, visited Ireland last year in her previous role as president of the national committee for monitoring EU accession negotiations.  During my meeting with her and her colleagues, she spoke of how the accession process and the reforms it entailed had been to the overall benefit of Croatia.  She pointed in particular to the requirements on the judiciary and fundamental rights.  This area has seen the greatest reform, which she considered to be the EU membership negotiations' greatest benefit for Croatia.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Croatia's progress has shown others the way and proven that the benefits of European integration are within their grasp.  Croatia has shown that it is possible for a country once ravaged by war and inter-ethnic strife to build stable democratic institutions where fundamental rights are respected and the rule of law is strengthened.  It has shown that it is possible for a country that declared its independence just 21 years ago to build a competitive economy that is ready to form a part of the Internal Market and that has coped with the financial crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I am also encouraged by Croatia's stated commitment to help its neighbours in the western Balkans to reach their goal of EU membership.  The Croatian Government has already generously shared its translations of the<i>acquis</i> with its neighbours.  It has undertaken to share its experience of the accession process to help guide others along the path.  Croatia will prove to be a responsible member of the Union with which Ireland can work effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">As we debate the other aspects of the Bill, it is heartening to be reminded in this time of crisis that EU membership remains attractive and that countries are prepared to make painful reforms in order to join it.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The second amendment to the Bill that the Government will move on Committee Stage will provide for the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the treaty of Lisbon, which was signed in Brussels on 16 May to form part of the domestic law of the State.  The signing of this protocol represents the culmination of a process that reaches back to the agreement reached among the EU leaders at the European Council meeting of 18 and 19 June 2009 when they agreed upon a decision on the concerns of the Irish people on the Lisbon treaty with regard to the right to life, family and education; taxation; and security and defence.  The European Council stated that the sole purpose of the protocol would be to give full treaty status to the clarifications set out in the decision.  The protocol will clarify but not change either the content or the application of the Lisbon treaty.  In taking its decision, the European Council agreed that, at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty, the decision's provisions would be set out in a protocol to be attached, in accordance with the respective constitutional requirements of the member states, to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">As Croatian accession is moving closer and the process of ratification of its accession treaty is under way, it is timely that the process of turning the decision into a protocol is also being advanced.  I warmly welcome the signing of the protocol, which is a case of our EU partners again delivering on their solemn promises.  These are not entered into lightly and are delivered upon as agreed.  It is fitting that this amendment is being introduced alongside the Croatian accession treaty.  The amendment will pave the way for Ireland to ratify our protocol.  I look forward to all EU partners having done so by the end of June 2013, which is the target date for the protocol's entry into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">This Bill is short and technical, but significant, and touches on some of the most important issues confronting the Union.  I look forward to an informed and reasoned debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_683">-----but we can all be quite satisfied with the nature of the campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">We all accept that last Thursday's decisive vote in favour of the stability treaty was a significant step along a long and winding path towards tackling the euro crisis for this country and Europe as a whole.  The past four years of the crisis have placed the Union and the eurozone in particular under unprecedented stress.  Fiscal imbalances, the threat of financial contagion and a profound disequilibrium between eurozone economies on a scale unimaginable to the signatories and creators of the Maastricht treaty dominate the EU agenda.  The stability treaty establishes a fiscal framework as one part of a larger, complex puzzle of measures that are needed to stave off the collapse of the euro and the ensuing disastrous economic consequences.  It is a step towards confronting the euro crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which replaces the temporary European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, with a €700 billion financial bazooka, is the next step along the road to confronting the immense challenge that the euro faces.  Despite threats from opponents of the stability treaty who continue to fail to outline where they will get the money from, the ESM represents a back-stop and a source of reliable funding at sustainable borrowing rates if Ireland requires it post 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">This Bill is the first step in a two-stage process in passing the ESM, which is the latest piece in the puzzle of addressing the euro crisis.  While the technical details of the ESM will be fully fleshed out when Second Stage of its passage is debated tomorrow, this evening is an opportunity to look at the broader necessity of the ESM.  I will outline the context of the crisis and its origins before speaking about the necessity of the ESM and its role in the broader, complex and arduous task of addressing the profound structural problems in the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Examining the origins of the current crisis gives us some perspective on this important Bill and the need for the creation of the ESM as well as a sense of what future action will be required.  The Maastricht treaty created a revamped European Union and a common currency that had two aims, those being economic and political.  The economic aim was to provide financial stability and integration away from the endemic fluctuations and pressures of floating exchange rates.  The political aim was to strengthen the "ever closer Union" following the dramatic shifts in the political topography of Europe after the end of the Cold War.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Since 1970 and the creation of the Werner plan for monetary and fiscal union, the proponents of deeper European integration and the economic stability and growth that they hoped it would bring envisaged a currency union as a positive European force.  Currency conflicts such as the infamous battle of the franc in 1992, when the French central bank desperately attempted to retain some parity with the ever strengthening Deutschmark, underlined the damage that fluctuations in exchange rates could inflict upon a common market.  The limits of efforts such as the currency snake to provide stability had been ruthlessly exposed by the divergent strengths of European economies.  Black Wednesday in Britain, when sterling dropped out of the exchange rate mechanism, ERM, thereby tarnishing the economic reputation of the Conservative Party, is testament to the difficulties of exchange rates and the pressures under which they place governments.  Furthermore, the dramatic political backdrop of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the re-unification of Germany and the end of the Cold War was a tectonic geopolitical shift on a scale not seen since the defeat of the Axis powers in 1945.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The creators of the single currency were operating on<i>terra nova</i>, a changed Europe.  The original <i>raison d’être</i> of the EEC had been underpinned by the omnipresent spectre of the USSR, which helped to unify the rest of free Europe.  The loss of this unifying force and the re-unification of Germany re-ignited old fears among a generation of leaders still shaped by the Second World War about the prospect of overbearing German dominance across the Continent.  Under the guidance of Jacques Delors in the Commission and the leadership of French President François Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the EEC sought to forge a new union and common currency that would allay such fears and ensure a European Germany rather than a German Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">It is against this backdrop of strategic political demands and objectives that the Maastricht treaty took shape and established a common currency to achieve both its economic and political aims.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The common currency ultimately expanded across 17 of the 27 EU member states.  A successful transition from national currencies, buoyant economic growth across the Continent and the convergence of bond yields for participant countries near the historically low Deutsche bond levels masked profound problems with the design framework of the euro.  Behind the reality, however, disequilibrium between eurozone countries occurred where large current account deficits and surpluses accumulated, as countries did not have the usual economic indicator of an exchange rate.  This allowed for a sharp economic divergence to develop, particularly between northern and southern eurozone countries.  The accumulated trade surpluses in certain countries were recycled by their banks fuelling asset bubbles and consumption in other countries.  The euro both facilitated and masked the problems at hand.  The inability of countries to use the traditional currency devaluation lever to adjust and compete with other countries placed greater pressure on internal devaluation and the recessionary impact that can have.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Behind the initial success lay structural problems that were utterly exposed in the aftermath of the fallout from the sub-prime mortgage crisis that emerged in the USA.  The collapse of Lehman Brothers was a cataclysmic event that starved the markets of funding and exposed the weaknesses of certain eurozone countries.  The limits of the eurozone structures were completely laid bare by the pressures that countries blocked out from the bond market and struggling with banking debt were coming under.  Ireland had adhered to the criteria under the Stability and Growth Pact that aimed to stabilise fiscal policy across the eurozone, unlike France and Germany which were the first to break the pact.  Yet the deeper problems in the euro, the problems we are now seeking to address, ultimately generated the grave challenges we face as a country today.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Since 2008, Europe has in effect being playing catch up.  The scale of the problems have become increasingly apparent and the scope of the solutions, many of them politically inconceivable at the start of the crisis, are coming to the fore.  The initial creation of the European financial stability facility, EFSF, and the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM, as funds for supporting countries that were unable to access funding on the bond markets, was an<i>ad hoc</i> response to an escalating situation.  The fiscal treaty was another step towards addressing some of the underlying problems of the eurozone.  The evolution of the European Central Bank, which has purchased bonds on the secondary market and launched a multi-billion euro LTRO, long-term re-financing operation, to finance banks and avoid the banking system from freezing over is also another milestone in adapting to the crisis.  The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, represents a permanent funding mechanism to support countries on a level and scale inconceivable even three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">In light of the weariness of creditor countries to lend money and the EU restrictions on financial support, the creation of the ESM marks a significant shift in eurozone policy and a transformation of pre-existing thinking on the crisis.  While Europe has stalled on several issues and the pressing need for change is all too clear the creation of the ESM, the evolving role of the ECB and the passage of the stability treaty all represent significant steps forward for a Union often derided by the term "euro sclerosis".</p>
          <p eId="para_695">This Bill is the first step in the two stage passage of the ESM, which is a crucial part of the EU response to the euro crisis, providing a permanent bailout mechanism and a financial backstop for eurozone countries.  Vetoing the ESM, as some opponents advocate, will simply generate uncertainty and deny Ireland access to a reliable source of money at sustainable borrowing rates if necessary after the bailout funds finish.  It amends Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty, to allow for the establishment of a permanent financial support mechanism, the ESM for the eurozone.  Ireland's membership of the ESM involves two steps - ratifying the treaty and the Dáil passing an amendment to Article 136 of the EU treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The stability mechanism will provide the necessary tool for dealing with such cases of risk to the financial stability of the euro area as a whole as experienced in 2010 and, hence, help preserve the economic and financial stability of the Union itself.  The finer technical details of the ESM will be dealt with in the ESM Bill which comes before the Dáil on Thursday under the auspices of the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The question was raised during the stability treaty campaign as to why Ireland is not holding a referendum on the ESM.  The Independent Member for Donegal South-West, Deputy Thomas Pringle, has brought a High Court challenge that encompasses the ESM and Article 136.  He wants the court to examine the legality of an amendment to an existing treaty which, he says, will also be pushed through without a vote if the 31 May referendum were passed, as it has been.  Deputy Pringle has asked the court to look at this amendment before any further action is taken by the Government to approve it.  However, legal advice to the Government indicates the changes to Article 136 do not come under the scope of the 1987 Crotty judgment which places a legal obligation on the Government to hold referenda on issues that significantly affect sovereignty.  I will not comment further on an ongoing court case except to provide the context to our own discussion on the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">During the referendum debate Sinn Féin and other opponents of the recently passed fiscal compact treaty advocated that we veto the ESM using the Article 136 amendment mechanism to re-negotiate the terms of its loans.  However, this ignores two critical issues.  It is far from clear that the Article 136 amendment is really necessary to set up the ESM.  The European Court of Justice has never said so.  The only court to have pronounced on this issue - the German Federal Constitutional Court - produced a highly ambiguous ruling on this point last October.  Indeed, the ESM's temporary predecessor, the EFSF, was successfully set up on the basis of another treaty article.  In other words, it is unclear that Ireland actually has a veto on the setting up of the ESM.  Opponents may be overplaying their hand in threatening a veto.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">More importantly, Ireland does not benefit from vetoing the ESM.  Why would we want to block a source of reliable funds at sustainable borrowing rates?  Threatening to veto an institution as vital as the ESM would be an utterly bizarre strategy for a country in Ireland's weak position.  It would achieve nothing other than infuriate those states upon which we are reliant for funding.  The ESM provides a reliable source of funding from 2013 if Ireland needs a second bailout, a matter which opponents of the fiscal compact have failed to point out.  Furthermore, it provides a backstop which will assure potential investors in Irish bonds that they will be re-paid if the State runs into future financial difficulty, thus lowering Ireland's borrowing costs.  If Ireland vetoes the ESM, where will we get money from after the bailout finishes in 2013?</p>
          <p eId="para_700">As I outlined earlier the problems with the eurozone are manifold and require real commitment and leadership from across the Continent to overcome effectively.  Fianna Fáil has consistently argued that, in addition to the progress made with the fiscal compact treaty and the establishment of the ESM, much more fundamental work remains to be done to save the eurozone.  Monetary union needs to be complemented with a higher level of fiscal and political union with EU institutions such as the ECB reformed to suit a new role.  We advocate an overhaul of the role of the ECB to allow it purchase the bonds of countries in financial difficulties and adapt a goal of economic growth as well as its current objective of price stability.  A pan-European banking resolution and regulation authority which guarantees deposits across the Union should also be established.  Debt should be mutualised across the eurozone with the launch of eurobonds which can be used to help stimulate growth.  The disequilibrium between member states' economies in terms of government spending, labour unit costs and inflation needs to be recognised and addressed when shaping broader monetary and fiscal policy.  The fiscal compact treaty and ESM are small steps towards addressing the broader profound problems that the eurozone faces.  The design flaws of the euro need to be tackled if it is to survive in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is one part of a bigger puzzle and its implementation will be beneficial to both Ireland and Europe.  It is one more step for us to take along the road to recovery, and it is important that this House passes this legislation as quickly as possible.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
          <p eId="para_702">It is typical of the chaotic approach that has been taken by the EU leadership over a period that this Bill comes before us today in this form.  From day one of this crisis, there has been no joined-up and thought-out attempt to deal with the core issues causing this significant social catastrophe for people across Europe.  The rule book has been thrown out the window, along with the community method.  When the rules do not suit, it seems the EU now ignores them.  Britain and the Czech Republic now find themselves half-divorced from the rest of the Union, something we were told for decades would never be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">There has only been one approach tried by the EU with this and previous Governments, which is austerity at all costs, and it has been a failure.  It reflects extremely poorly on this Government and once again it has clearly been out-negotiated, allowing itself to accept a blackmail link between the proposed ESM and the austerity treaty.  It failed to stand up for Ireland at every point in this crisis, and that performance is continuing as the Irish people are still paying dearly for the failure of the elected leaders.  We should be clear that this is a bad way to make law and it is constitutionally questionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">We call on the Government to publish its legal advice from the Attorney General on this matter.  Sinn Féin does not agree with the use of the controversial simplified revision procedure, Article 48.6 of the Treaty on the European Union, to make this amendment.  Treaty changes should be arrived at through democratic dialogue and should not be rushed through loopholes.  This smacks of backroom dealing and does nothing to inspire confidence among our citizens in the EU and its decision-making procedure.  The self-amending clause, as it is called, was inserted into EU law in the Lisbon treaty.  Sinn Féin opposed it then and warned it could be used to rush through unpopular and ill-thought out decisions of significant importance without the normal level of scrutiny and democratic debate.  We have been proven correct on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Will the Government explain why this route was chosen over the standard approach?  Why did it choose the option that allows the least scrutiny and debate?  Sinn Féin is in favour of a fund that can be used as a last resort for states blocked from borrowing on the markets.  Such an idea ties in with our vision of a Europe which offers genuine solidarity to members when they are in need.  We are not willing to support any old stability mechanism.  We will not support a bankers' mechanism or one hitched to the train of austerity.  Such a mechanism is of no use to the ordinary people of Europe in the medium and long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The ESM will inherit many of the failings of its predecessor, the European Financial Stability Facility.  There is some hope and time to allow for an improvement in what is being proposed, and the Spanish Government is seeking changes.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, will outline in detail tomorrow Sinn Féin's position on the ESM so I will not elaborate on it greatly now.  Needless to say, it is not Sinn Féin's ideal solution.  We would prefer to see the European Central Bank empowered to act as a lender of last resort, with the ability to recapitalise banks where necessary.  This is not a realistic political option at this point.  As usual, during the crisis, alternatives seemingly are not considered as the system must be protected at all costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Greece, Spain and possibly Cyprus, as well as this State, are likely to require emergency funding in the near future.  We hope that by supporting this amendment, despite our criticism of how it was arrived at, the EU and our Government will take the opportunity to re-examine the options available and use this facility to create an emergency funding vehicle that matches the needs of citizens.  That would be a major step forward in providing stability to the eurozone and the real economy.  That is why we are supporting this Bill on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">There are two additional items to be added on Committee Stage.  I convey Sinn Féin's support for the Croatian accession treaty protocol.  It has been a long journey for the Croatian people and in the European affairs and foreign affairs committee there has been a long dialogue dealing with these issues.  We have maintained a very active interest in the affairs of the western Balkans.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade knows our concerns about Serbia and Bosnia.  There is an ongoing position in Serbia where homosexual rights activists cannot hold an event to celebrate their rights, which is completely contrary to the progressive culture that is inherent in the European Union.  There is also a concern about the approach of the Serbian Government in destabilising Bosnia.  Lord Ashdown has been here to outline his concerns, having played a leading role in the region.  Croatia is a good news story but before we can see the story replicated by other states in the western Balkans we must deal with certain challenges.  Baroness Catherine Ashton, the external affairs representative for the European Union, will have a challenge in that region and although there has been a fair bit of criticism, I hope the issues can be resolved soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">It was indicated that once Croatia takes up its place in the European Union, there will be access to our domestic labour markets.  Ireland should be quite embarrassed about how we have treated the Romanian and Bulgarian citizens, as we have not given them the same rights as other eastern European countries which acceded to the European Union.  There was a second opportunity recently for our Government to remedy that injustice and we failed to do so again.  I do not anticipate that the Croatian citizens will enjoy those rights but I am hopeful the Government will review the decision it has made on Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.  That would demonstrate true European solidarity and give those citizens the same rights as other members of the European Union.  It is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I could comment mischievously about the protocol relating to the concerns of the Irish people about the first Lisbon treaty.  I will withhold my comments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_713">It is scandalous, particularly as the Labour Party is involved, that we will debate under a guillotine, not just today but tomorrow, items of fundamental importance to the future of Europe and the sovereignty of citizens in this country.  Our comments must be corralled into a very short space, which is wholly unacceptable.  It is a complete U-turn, yet again, by the Government which was elected on the basis of talking about changes, transparency, open government and involvement of our citizens.  It is a shame, and the Labour Party should be particularly embarrassed by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Some of the transitional measures in the legislation regarding MEPs are fine but the key reason we will oppose it is the fact it involves the facility to amend Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  This was a central issue in the debate we had on the fiscal treaty.  It is somewhat ironic and regrettable we are discussing it now as one would think these measures were in place, given the debate of recent weeks.  Despite the protests of Fianna Fáil, in order to make these amendments, we need the unanimous agreement of all member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The European Union clearly needs the amendment to set up the permanent bailout fund, as it calls it, although "bailout" is a harmless term for what is really extortion.  Loan-sharking would be a more accurate way of putting it.  The idea, as put forward by Fianna Fáil, that we are simply facilitating the creation of a reliable source of funding is ludicrous.  It might have been ridiculous last week in the debate on the fiscal treaty, but this week, given the events in Spain, it is completely ridiculous.  Spain alone could subsume the entire fund without any other country getting a look in.  The problem is that Europe is at a crossroads and rather than taking stock and changing direction, we are perpetuating the same mistakes and digging a deeper hole.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Fianna Fáil asks from where we will get the money, which was the stock argument in the last few weeks.  The facilitation of the setting up of the ESM was supposedly to save the eurozone, but we continue to see huge pressures exerted.  A default by Greece or other countries would lead to enormous costs if the eurozone was broken up.  There are pressures in that regard.  By asking from where we will get the money, it avoids the central question of why we are looking for it.  One of the key reasons is bank debt; for us to pay back debts that were never ours in the first place.  We must see this debate in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I nearly feel sorry for the Taoiseach, given how much he has been slapped around in the last few days since the passing of the fiscal treaty.  Despite his bleating about getting a better deal, he has been firmly slapped into place by his German colleagues and had to admit that despite the passing of the fiscal treaty referendum, it is unlikely the bank debt issue will be sorted out.  Let us face it, he was told to go away and that the European Union had more important things to be worried about than him and his bank debt.  It shows how naive the Government was in its approach to the referendum and the whole issue of bank debt that is imposing such severe austerity on the lives and living standards of ordinary people across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Doffing the cap will not work.  The Government has been told this; therefore, it must take stock and look at this issue in a different way.  It is not too late; even though the people voted to pass the fiscal treaty, that does not mean the treaty has been ratified, it merely gives the Government permission to ratify it on behalf of the people.  Presumably that permission could be altered afterwards.  There is a precedent for this in that the people voted to change the way people were elected to Seanad Éireann, but the then Government did not enact the legislation to make that change.  The Government, therefore, has the power not to ratify the fiscal treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The Tánaiste should make a stand because it is clear now is the time for the Government to stand up or be bypassed.  We should join the rest of Europe which has not ratified the treaty.  We see growing instability in countries such as Germany in which opposition parties have made it clear they are not interested in signing up to the treaty based on the fact that there are no growth criteria.  We see in countries such as the Netherlands massive growth in the polls for those parties opposed to austerity and nothing will happen until the Greek and French elections are out of the way.  We have the chance to do something, not to let the moment pass.  The Government should consider this because we are debating a major change to a key European Union treaty to set up a permanent fund that will cost the country economically and socially.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">There has been a lot of discussion about strict conditionality.  In the debate on the treaty we were led to believe it just meant that we would sign up to the treaty and then have access to the ESM fund.  That is not the case.  This is a code word for the acceleration of vicious austerity, a programme of major macro-economic adjustment which will be spearheaded by the European Commission and Central Bank which will decide on key issues of economic policy in Ireland that will have a major impact on citizens.  That is what it means - the policies that are being enforced and the neoliberal agendas highlighted yesterday when talking about events in Latvia in recent years where 10% of the population were forced to leave the country, 30% of public sector workers were sacked and the remaining employees had a 40% pay cut.  As a result, the Latvian economy shrank by 25%.  It has turned around a little, with a small growth figure last year, which is being lauded as a great achievement, but it masks the butchery that took place before it.  No economy, never mind a group of economies such as those in the European Union, has ever been turned around by austerity measures.  Ratifying this treaty would increase the European tendency to put the interests of bankers and big business ahead of those of the people or the social charter the European Union was designed to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">When we look at changing the treaties to facilitate the establishment of the ESM, we see the Labour Party and Fine Gael going along with it.  Article 15 of the ESM treaty indicates how the funds can be used to recapitalise financial institutions.  The Labour Party has made a great virtue of how it opposed the bank guarantee, while Fine Gael claims it did not realise what was happening, that Fianna Fáil and the Green Party were to blame and that if Fine Gael had had access to all of the information, it would not have supported the bank guarantee either.  What else does this article provide for except a similar situation in all of Europe, transferring private bank debts on to the shoulders of European citizens?  Those who were supposedly opposed to this in Ireland, who would have done something about it had they been in government, are now in power and have the opportunity to do it because the Government enjoys the power of veto and has the ability to use its voice such that the rest of Europe will sit up and take notice.  Contrary to the remarks made that such a course of action would leave us isolated, it would result in an almighty cheer throughout the rest of Europe from our fellow citizens who have been reeling from austerity measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">We are talking about facilitating a fund we may or may not be able to access but into which we will definitely have to pay money.  The fund is based on an €11 billion provision.  From where will this money come?  It is money that can be called upon, with an initial payment of €1.47 billion, but we must pay the money in instalments, starting with a sum of €225 million next month, from an economy that is already on its knees and paying billions in interest payments on previous debts.  There is the proviso that the amount can be increased at any time, with a demand for the full amount to be paid should it be deemed necessary by the board which will adjudicate on the matter.  We have the ludicrous situation where a fund is being set up in order that we can have access to it, but we must also pay into it.  By virtue of the setting up of the fund in the first place, it could be instrumental in pushing us in the direction of a second bailout, the very thing it was allegedly set up to prevent.  This is economic lunacy and a massive infringement on the sovereign rights of citizens of this state.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">We do not have time to develop the points made and, sadly, not all of us will be able to speak in the debate tomorrow on the ESM proper because it is to be guillotined.  The idea of legal immunity being built into the ESM such that it will not be accountable or subject to freedom of information requests is scandalous.  Crucially, there is the issue of whether a referendum is necessary.  I think it is but the matter is before the courts.  It is ironic that while we are discussing this legislation, which the Government intends to ram through following a vote, the courts are wondering what way they will adjudicate on it.  It does not matter what way this is packaged.  The reality is that what is bring provided for is a major transfer of sovereign powers and a major signing off of funds belonging to the citizens and how they will be spent and handed over.  The idea that people would not have a say on this or that elected Members would have their debate guillotined is an affront.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Government parties' method of doffing the cap has been exposed in the past few days.  They have been shown to be a bit player in Europe.  People are not particularly interested in what they have to say and the polite approach does not work.  They still have an opportunity to show a bit of muscle and they should do that by opposing this legislation and the legislation on the ESM which will be before the House tomorrow.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_725">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The EU has a long way to go to convince people of its sincerity and trust and the recent referendum showed that clearly when 50% of our citizens stayed at home on polling day.  All politicians and Governments must reflect on this.  Let us have a proper debate about the future direction of the Union.  When 50% of the people stay at home rather than vote on an important referendum, that sends out a strong message about the lack of connection between them and the European project.  That is why it is important to have independent voices to act as a watchdog, as most of the large political parties are sleepwalking on Europe and they do not seem to know what is happening on the day.  The referendum, the banking crisis and the ongoing debate on the huge debt problem have demonstrated clearly that eurocrats are still sitting on the bench with ten minutes to go.  They need a wake up call quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I know where I stand on Europe and, as an internationalist, my political and economic world does not end in Berlin or Paris.  However, most of the so-called pro-European politicians and political parties in the House do not know where they are going and that is not quality leadership.  We also have a Taoiseach who will not participate in live media debates with party leaders or Independent Members.  What kind of message does that send to the people of Ireland and Europe and to the millions of unemployed people throughout the Union?  That reflects a lack of confidence, which is not what we need in a time of crisis.  We need strong and decisive leaders and, sadly, that is lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Bill "is necessary to amend the European Communities Act 1972, in order to provide that the Protocol, amending the Protocol on transitional provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community; and that the European Council Decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro, shall form part of the domestic law of the State".  That is the purpose of the legislation but again the Second Reading has been guillotined.  This means the business of signing up to the ESM treaty and committing us to significant expenditure to help bail out Spain and other member states in the coming period could go through all Stages in the Oireachtas by the end of next week with minimal debate in the media about the long-term implications of these steps or awareness of what all this means among the public.  The relation of the ESM treaty to the Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, amendment of the EU treaties authorising it and to the fiscal treaty on which Irish voters decided last Thursday is set out in an excellent book entitled "A Tale of Two Treaties - A Citizens Guide to the Stability Treaties of 2012" by Cork solicitors, Joe Noonan and Mary Lenihan.  It is important to deal with the detail of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The proposal to ratify the ESM treaty as it stands and to approve the Article 136 TFEU amendment to the EU treaties as authorising the stability mechanism envisaged in the ESM treaty is unlawful under EU treaties and are, therefore, unconstitutional in Ireland and other member states.  We should examine these proposals closely.  Constitutional challenges have been mounted to the ESM treaty and to the Article 136 TFEU amendment in our courts and in Estonia.  Deputy Thomas Pringle has launched a constitutional challenge on these matters which opens in the High Court on 19 June.  His lawyers are seeking a constitutional referendum on the ESM treaty.  They also claim that "the EU treaties should be amended under a different provision of the Art. 48 TEU treaty revision procedure than that being currently used if the ESM treaty as it stands is to be lawfully ratified under European law."  The Deputy's legal action is seeking to defend the principle - this has been often misrepresented - that the Union is an entity governed by the rule of law in the face of political attempts to change the European treaties by subterfuge and to open a way of transforming the current EMU into a fiscal-political union for the eurozone.  I and many other Irish people share his concern that the integrity of the existing EU treaties and the Constitution be upheld in the face of an attempt by some eurozone governments to take the eurozone captive for their own ends and to organise the EMU on different principles from heretofore by means of the ESM treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I have major concerns about what is happening in Ireland and the world generally regarding the financial crisis and the connections between finance, politics and current and former politicians.  A number of top level politicians have recently become members of a secretive corporate billionaire and political society known as the Bilderberg group.  Members openly express their desire to see protestors against their new world order "die in plane crashes" or label them as "cockroaches".  I find these comments highly offensive and consider the secretive nature of their meetings a direct threat to democracy around the world, as there is mounting evidence to suggest the group's members have purposely engineered the global economic crisis for their own financial gain.  The list of members is interesting.  They include Paul Gallagher and Dermot Gleeson, former Attorneys General, Michael McDowell, former Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the current Minister for Finance and Peter Sutherland of Fine Gael and Goldman Sachs International.  The agenda of the group's meeting in 2011 includes direct references to the true scale of the Irish economic crisis and it can be seen that members of the group are actively trying to destroy the economy in order that they can personally profit from the financial crisis by investing in the private companies to which our State assets are being sold off at way below their true market value and by financially betting against Ireland on the international stock and currency markets.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">I accept the Acting Chairman's advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">I raised EU issues during the debate on the fiscal treaty referendum.  Many of us felt the treaty was flawed and did not inspire confidence in the economy.  I also said it was a rushed decision.  Rushed decisions are bad decisions and this has been proved by a number of decisions taken in recent years to address the banking crisis.  I heard the Taoiseach having a go at Deputy Shane Ross this morning regarding his proposal some weeks ago to defer the fiscal treaty referendum.  When Deputy Ross put forward that proposal, polls showed that 54% of the electorate wanted the Government to take a calmer and cooler approach.  The failure of almost half of the electorate to cast their vote in the referendum last week tells its own tale.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Economic growth and jobs should have been at the heart of the treaty instead of in the form of an add-in which indicated that action will hopefully be taken in six months time.  That will be too late for many people.  One can only hope that the change of government in France will provide some impetus to progress in this regard.  Regardless of the positions taken in other member states, our Government should come out strongly on the issue.  There was a great deal of reference during the debate on the referendum to Article 3, paragraph 1, and Article 4 of the treaty, with many of us expressing concern that the additional €5.7 billion in cuts from 2015 would only deepen the recession.  Commerzbank, a European financial giant, observed that the treaty was totally irrelevant to an Irish recovery and would have no major impact on it.  Although I would not generally be on the side of such organisations, that assessment is particularly clear and instructive.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">On the broader issue of economic sovereignty and the sovereignty of the State, I am greatly concerned by the treaty provisions which give powers of oversight to the European Union.  The treaty bypasses the Dáil as the final arbiter of budgetary policy and, as such, is yet another agreement which signs away Irish sovereignty and freedom and assigns a power of determination over their affairs beyond that of the Irish people as represented by the Oireachtas.  Governments will no longer have a free rein on broad economic policies in terms of when to spend to stimulate the economy.  The elephant in the room is that this marks the first serious step towards a federal Union where national governments are subservient to the European Commission or the European Central Bank.  I have no difficulty in others expressing support for European federalism - a type of united states of Europe -  but my own preference is for a Europe of independent nation states.  The global economic crisis, however, has led us to a situation where Germany is the only country in a strong position in these negotiations.  The reality is that the entire European Union project is being moulded into the German model for the future.  That is an issue deserving of our close attention.  We should have been afforded more time and latitude to consider the ongoing debate on the treaty in Germany before asking the Irish people to make their decision thereon.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">This morning we heard further proof that the German Parliament, across all political parties, is determined to shut the door firmly on any proposed deal on our bank debt.  Many of us made the case during the debate that the treaty opens the door for the European Union to dictate precisely how Irish governments can spend Exchequer moneys and that the current troika arrangements may become a standard in the future.  We are all in favour of good housekeeping and seek to adhere to it in our family and personal lives.  No Member of this House is opposed to the country getting its financial act together.  However, the other elephant in the room is that the treaty includes no provisions for the easing of the debt burden.  I have referred to Germany, but the situation in Greece, France and right across Europe is changing by the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Bill provides for the substitution of a new definition for the existing definition of the treaties governing the European Union.  I emphasise the word "treaty", which implies a respect for difference and diversity.  A community is about looking after each another, not having major players walking over smaller entities.  I have spoken to a number of Members of the European Parliament who, although very pro-Europe, are greatly concerned by the manner in which democracy has been shafted in the past 12 months.  Recent elections in various member states must serve as a wake-up call to us all.  I take this opportunity to wish the Irish football team well in the European Championships.  However, concern as been expressed for the safety of supporters in certain locations where we have seen the emergence of political groups on the extreme right.  Resentment of the Union among ordinary European citizens is an issue that cannot be ignored by any government.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Section 2 of the Bill refers to the European Council decision of 25 March 2011 amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to the European Stability Mechanism.  The reality, at this time, is that we have stagnation instead of stability, coercion in place of co-operation and authoritarianism rather than governance, all of which is leading to a stifling of growth across the Union.  I remind the Tánaiste of his pre-election promises to burn the Anglo Irish Bank bondholders and his claim that it would be Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  I urge him and his Government colleagues to support the pro-growth voices across the Union.  The Tánaiste must also support the reform of the ECB that would allow it to issue euro bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Small business owners in this country are very concerned by the provisions of Article 3 which stipulate that eurozone members' budgetary position must be balanced or in surplus, with a structural deficit ceiling of 0.5% of gross domestic product.  Article 4 provides that when the ratio of government debt to gross domestic products exceeds 60%, the member state in question must reduce that debt at an average rate of one twentieth per year.  These issues were discussed during the debate and remain relevant to today's discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">We must have a broader debate on the European Union which allows us to examine in a positive way where we are going and whether we are making the right decisions.  Many of us who raised genuine concerns in recent weeks were dismissed as cranks and worse.  As an Independent Member of this House and a member of the Technical Group, my responsibility, together with my colleagues, is to ensure every proposal the Government brings before the House is scrutinised, challenged and debated in the interests of the people.  I accept without qualm the democratic result of the referendum.  However, it must be borne in mind that in my own constituency of Dublin North Central, for instance, 37.8% of voters rejected the proposal on the basis of very genuine concerns, while many others stayed at home.  There is a disconnect between ordinary citizens and the establishment right across the European Union.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_742">We are all aware of the grave crisis facing Europe such that the future of the eurozone project is now in question.  We can also see how joined at the hip we all are in terms of our financial and economic futures.  The availability of a rescue mechanism for Spain, Estonia, Greece or any other member state is as important to Ireland as the availability of such a mechanism for ourselves.  Given the relative size of Spain's economy, it is probably even more important.  After more than four years of successive financial crises, we are finally at the end game.  That which was heretofore unmentionable - whether one calls it the spectre in the corner, the elephant in the room or the thing of which we are all afraid - is now being openly discussed, namely, the potential collapse of the euro, with a growing view that such an outcome is moving from a possibility to a probability.  Parliamentarians across Europe have a role in ensuring that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">If we thought we were grappling with disaster heretofore, there is now a realisation across the eurozone that we have seen nothing compared with what would befall us were the euro to fail.  This would be a disaster not only for Ireland, Spain, Greece or any other individual state, but a cataclysmic disaster for all 17 eurozone countries, including Germany.  It would be only slightly less of a disaster for the other EU member states and for the countries with which Europe trades.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">This is an enormously challenging time for European leaders, unlike any outside wartime in Europe.  The time for pussyfooting is over, as is the time for timid and tentative half measures.  We need decisive political leadership in addressing a comprehensive solution not only to the immediate crisis with the euro in Spain but also in ensuring the euro is placed on a sustainable footing if it is to survive.  That is the leadership required.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Spain is talking about a bailout requirement of approximately €40 billion, but the reality is - this is widely accepted - that it is only now external experts have been called in to validate its banks' exposure.  God knows what the exposure of its banks will ultimately be, but it is widely accepted that it will be considerably in excess of the €40 billion mentioned.  Whatever the figure is, Spain must be rescued.  If it goes down, we all will.  Right now it is more important to our future that it is rescued than any Irish bank deal or renegotiation of a bank deal.  That is not to say we do not need a better deal on our bailout programme - we certainly do.  That is precisely why the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and every Minister raise this issue at every opportunity and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The ratification of the treaty on fiscal prudence and agreeing to these new rules will help by proving our commitment to engaging in sensible fiscal behaviour.  So too would a better deal for Spain, especially if the deal shifts the burden from the sovereign to the banks.  Currently, that is not permitted.  Under existing rules, neither the current EFSF nor the soon to be permanent facility, the ESM, is allowed to make direct injections into banks.  However, I am sure it is not beyond the ingenuity of our leaders to find some mechanism to allow the rescue of the banks in Spain which, at the same time, will not drive the sovereign over the edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I certainly hope a more favourable deal for Spain which may be negotiated will be reflected in a reopening and restructuring of the bailout deal and conditions for Ireland.  On the night prior to the bailout in Ireland when many welcomed the rescue and the funding assured by the the bailout, I spoke in near desperation about the need for the Government of the day to resist being bounced into a bailout.  I knew then, even if it was unavoidable in the long term, that once the bailout was negotiated and it was a<i> fait accompli</i>, our fate was sealed.  The minute we accepted the deal all of our leverage and all possibility of negotiations were gone and we were immediately bounced into a position of mendicant which we still hold to this day.  Whatever way we like to dress it up, we are dependent on others and subservient to their demands in respect of every penny we spend.  By accepting the deal and the conditions of the bailout, we also accepted responsibility for all bank liabilities.  This protected other countries’ banks, prevented the spread of contagion and protected the euro which benefited all of Europe.  </p>
          <p eId="para_748">For us, it meant that overnight our debt-to-GDP ratio reached monstrous proportions and it is still climbing.  This kind of bailout is the last thing Spain needs and it is the last thing Ireland needs for Spain.  Europe is out of time and talking about vetoes and postponing decisions is no longer an option.  We need to be honest with ourselves and accept that it may mean a move towards a more federal Europe and eurobonds.  When I talk about honesty, I do not mean honesty among ourselves in Ireland.  We must be honest with others also and move the debate on from a point where we simply talk about who among us is most opposed to austerity.  This Bill is a necessary step towards restoring Ireland's and Europe's economic fortunes.  As it is a perilous time for Europe, it is a step we must take.  As I said, we are at the end game and will not get a second chance.</p>

        <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Lucinda Creighton)</from>
          <p eId="para_749">I very much appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Second Stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012.  As the Tánaiste set out, the Bill provides for the incorporation into Irish law, once ratified, of two important provisions - the protocol on transitional arrangements for the European Parliament and the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I am particularly delighted to support the Bill in the new context created by the positive outcome of last week's referendum.  The Government published the Bill ahead of the referendum in order that the people would have the full picture available to them when they cast their votes.  We are now moving forward with its enactment as we said we would.  The referendum has sent a clear message to the world about how Ireland sees itself and how it is positioning itself to best secure its economic recovery.  We have shown that we are a committed and disciplined member of the eurozone.  We believe in fiscal responsibility in Ireland and every other country which has the euro as its currency.  This clearly is in our interests.  We have ensured this and future Governments will behave in a prudent way and have secured access for Ireland to the emergency funding available to those countries which are members of the European Stability Mechanism and have ratified the stability treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">In voting in favour of the treaty by such a significant margin, the people have strengthened the Government's hand when it comes to negotiating the new growth strategy for the European Union that will be the key item for discussion at the upcoming meeting of the European Council and to ensuring Ireland can benefit from any new step taken to stabilise the position in Europe's banks and sever the link between sovereign and banking debt.  I welcome the opportunity we had earlier when a number of Deputies opposite were present to touch on many of these issues.  No doubt we will come back to them again in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">These are further important steps towards securing Ireland's economic recovery and are most welcome.  The Government appreciates that the decision to vote "Yes" was not a straightforward one for many.  The economic developments of recent years have placed a significant burden on the shoulders of many ordinary Irish people.  The tough decisions we have had to take to get the economy back on track have had real consequences for people's lives, yet despite the very difficult circumstances, a very significant majority was prepared to endorse the treaty as a contribution to moving Ireland forward.  It was a courageous decision and the right one.  The Government recognises that it places a particular onus on us to redouble our efforts to secure growth, jobs and recovery.  It is a duty we take very seriously.  As the Taoiseach told the House, we will work diligently and creatively with partners to drive this agenda forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">As I have noted, the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 provides for the inclusion of two elements in the domestic law of the State.  The first is a protocol to the EU treaties which provides for a temporary increase in the number of MEPs.  This arrangement applies only for the life of the current European Parliament until 2014.  This arose due to the fact that the 2009 elections to the European Parliament took place before the Lisbon treaty had entered into force.  Under the Lisbon treaty, 12 member states were to be represented by an additional 18 MEPs.  Given that the Lisbon treaty entered into force before the end of 2009, EU leaders agreed that these member states should have their full complement of MEPs for this session of the Parliament too, thus giving rise to the protocol.  Given the temporary nature of its effect, this element of the Bill is essentially a matter of good housekeeping.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The second element the Bill seeks to include in the domestic law of the State – the European Council decision of 25 March 2011 amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - was introduced as a means to provide legal underpinning for the ESM.  The change to Article 136 is separate and distinct from the ESM treaty, but clearly the two are related.  The entry into force of the ESM treaty does not require the prior entry into force of the amendment to Article 136 - a fact highlighted by the target date for the entry into force of the ESM treaty, next month, while the amendment to Article 136 is expected to enter into force in January 2013.  It is wholly in Ireland's national interests to have established an ESM which is strong and robust.  The amendment to Article 136 contributes to that end and as such should be embraced by Ireland and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Since the publication of this Bill on 8 May, the Protocol on the Concerns of the Irish People on the Treaty of Lisbon was signed in Brussels, on 16 May.  Therefore, there are two further EU developments that need to be incorporated into the domestic law of the State.  The first is the Irish legal guarantees protocol, which I just mentioned, and the second is the Croatian accession treaty.  The Government will bring forward Dáil Committee Stage amendments to this Bill to provide for these additional elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">In 2009, when EU leaders agreed to provide a series of legal guarantees on a range of issues - including the right to life; family and education; taxation; and security and defence - they did so by way of a legally binding decision.  They also agreed that, at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty, the provisions of the decision would be set out in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties at the time of the next accession treaty.  With the signing of the Croatian accession treaty, work was progressed on our protocol, culminating in its signing last month.  I very much welcome this development as it is yet another real confirmation that the European Union keeps its promises to the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The second element to be introduced, as an amendment to this Bill next week, is the Croatian accession treaty.  Ireland has been a strong and steadfast supporter of the enlargement policy of the EU.  We were among the first beneficiaries of that policy when we joined almost four decades ago, and the enlargement of the Union continues to be relevant and appropriate and a process that Ireland supports.  Already our Croatian colleagues have joined us around the Council table as observers.  I look forward to welcoming Croatia as the 28th member state of the Union in the middle of next year.  This amendment to the European Communities Act 1972 will pave the way for Ireland's ratification of the Croatian accession treaty, which has been already ratified by the parliaments of seven member states and, of course, Croatia itself, following its referendum in January last.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I reiterate the importance of the decision taken in last week's referendum.  We again have confirmation from the Irish people that they are determined to remain at the heart of the European project and are ready, willing and able to take the necessary decisions to ensure this sentiment has real effect.  I very much welcome the adoption, in due course, of this Bill by the Oireachtas and look forward to pursuing actively the interests of Ireland and Europe in the period ahead.  I strongly commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
          <p eId="para_759">I thank the people for making the right decision last Thursday by supporting the amendment to the Constitution with regard to the stability treaty.  I acknowledge the 57.9% who voted "Yes" within the Galway West constituency.  One reason the Irish ratified the treaty - it was clear on the doorsteps - was that doing so would ensure access to the ESM.  A "No" vote would have meant Ireland could not access ESM funds, if required.  This Bill establishes the treaty in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">I concur with the comments of Deputy Olivia Mitchell on issues such as eurobonds.  I hope eurobonds become more possible in light of our ratification of the stability treaty and its eventual ratification across the European Union.  I refer also to the stimulus and project bonds, which clearly ought to be part of Europe-wide recovery, irrespective of whether they pertain to investments in capital projects or otherwise.  There is no shortage of projects across the Union and certainly in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The European Communities (Amendment) Bill facilitates in Irish law the amendment to the EU treaties to allow the member states to establish a stability mechanism to assist member states in difficulty.  It also allows for the appointment of 18 more MEPs.  This has arisen following the enlargement of the European Union.  During the recent treaty campaign and other campaigns, it was clear that those who argue decision-making has been transferred to Europe, that Brussels is where the real power lies and that we have signed away more of our sovereignty with each treaty were not correct.  Their claims are baseless.  The falseness is exposed by the very fact that this national Parliament's representatives of the people are debating this Bill only following the successful acceptance of the stability treaty by the people in a democratic vote.  We are, in effect, exercising our right as a sovereign, independent people to accept or reject the amendments being sought to European treaties.  These amendments have been on the agenda for a number of years now.  The idea of establishing a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area arose in October 2010 before the last general election.  This explains why Fianna Fáil campaigned alongside Fine Gael and the Labour Party for a "Yes" vote, on the stability treaty, which treaty is undeniably necessary to guarantee Irish access to the new stability fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">It is worth noting that when the  European treaties were consolidated into their present form some five years ago, it was stipulated that the Union would intervene financially to assist a member state only when that state found itself in serious difficulties caused by natural disasters, exceptional circumstances or circumstances beyond its control.  It is through this<i>ad hoc</i> mechanism that the Union was able to support various countries, first Greece and then Ireland and Portugal.  With the benefit of hindsight, it has been logical and appropriate over the past few economically turbulent years that the Union and its member states moved to create a structured and comprehensive assistance fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Opponents are continuing to insist that ratification will institutionalise and impose austerity for years to come.  This is incorrect.  Ireland agreed long before now to reduce its deficit and to tackle overspending, primarily out of necessity.  Everyone should know and understand that the country cannot spend indefinitely when it does not earn.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Another inaccurate contention of opponents to the stability treaty and the creation of a stability mechanism was that we could veto the legislation setting up the ESM by failing to pass the required legislation.  As the European Union has grown as a community of nation states, the use of qualified majority voting has replaced the national veto in most policy areas, chiefly because the veto has been used to the detriment of Europe and to stall the functioning of the Union on several occasions.  A famous example was the empty-chair crisis of 1965, whereby President de Gaulle and other French representatives refused to attend Council meetings, paralysing the Community.  The institutionalisation of the national veto led to decades of stagnation.  Qualified majority voting promotes co-operation, negotiation and consensus building.  The idea that Ireland should resort to using a veto by refusing to ratify the legislation before us is as ludicrous as it is unfeasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">To be clear in this case, exercising the veto we have would exclude us from a stability mechanism and a bailout fund.  Regrettably, Ireland is in a relatively weak position, despite the encouraging economic signs.  Why on earth would we wish to block the establishment of a stability mechanism we may ultimately need?  I hope that with further responsible decision-making plans and programmes and with a certain amount of fortune in the world economy, we will not require additional access to a stability mechanism.  However, as a majority of the electorate realised last Thursday, it is vital we ensure this option is open to us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_767">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I support the Bill.  In particular, I support the establishment of the ESM.  As the Tánaiste pointed out, this legislation will ensure it is enshrined in European law through the treaty on the functioning of Europe, unlike the EFSF, which tended to float somewhat outside the confines of the body of law that makes up the European Union.  For this reason, it is important that the Irish Parliament seeks to address that issue at a very early stage and recognises it appropriately. It would have been difficult to get this measure through during the course of the most recent referendum campaign.  The ESM will be in place very quickly when a number of countries have signed the instrument into law.  It is hoped it will be functioning well before this measure is enshrined in EU law early next year, as the Minister of State said.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The new stability mechanism is a vital component of the European Union's response to the crisis.  It is a measure for which we have been calling for some time.  The forerunner to this fund, the EFSF, was an<i>ad hoc</i> measure effectively operating outside the body of law in place to address the crises that existed in Greece, Portugal and Ireland.  It is worth noting that, at the time in question, Ireland moved rather quickly to seek to fall within the bailout programme and to seek funds from the EFSF in the hope of preventing the kind of contagion we have seen continue.  Despite the fact that Ireland was well funded at the time in question and would have been such for some time, the then Government still felt it was necessary to take action, through accepting entry to a bailout programme, in an effort to stave off the speculators and show that the country was not going to cause further problems.  Unfortunately, as I have said, that has not happened.  We now find ourselves on the brink of a bailout for Spain and who knows how the situation in Italy will develop in the coming weeks.  While the fund is in place, one wonders, if pressure is exerted from Spain for a larger bailout fund or if it involves one of the other countries such as Italy, if it will be big enough.  I hope there is advance planning at European level to ensure there will be an adequate response and that we will not find ourselves again having to use the <i>ad hoc</i> approach that we had to use in the past in relation to the EFSF.  I am sure Ireland will be contributing in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">As other Members stated, it is clear that the people were cognisant of the necessity for the support of our EU partners in making funds available to this country through the ESM.  We clearly hope we will be in a position to re-enter the markets place through the issuance of our own bonds as early as possible.  Given the turmoil in international markets and the impact of the recession on many of the countries with which we trade and to which we export, it seems unlikely that we will be able to do this without an extension of the current programme, or perhaps a new one.  It is right and fitting, therefore, that at an early stage this Parliament should show its support, having recognised that the people have given us that authority and overwhelming mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">When one considers the relatively low turnout, there was a high percentage in favour of the stability treaty which, in addition to the establishment of the ESM, sets in place the budgetary discipline measures required by other member states.  For that reason, I, too, congratulate all those who campaigned on both the "Yes" and the "No" sides.  The arguments were well and truly thrashed out.  Much of the negative campaign was based on a tissue of untruths, particularly as it related to the establishment of the ESM and the notion that somehow it was possible for Ireland to veto its establishment.  I always failed to understand why we would want to do that when it was something of which we would potentially have the benefit and for which we had called.  Somehow there was an expectation that we would veto its establishment to hold somebody else to ransom, while at the same time there was the suggestion one would somehow weaken the efforts Ireland would have to make to provide for its own budgetary discipline.  That was an argument the people did not accept and I am particularly pleased they did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">As well as to the passage of the stability treaty, we should lend considerable weight to the establishment of the ESM which of itself, is a backstop.  It is an insurance policy.  It is not a solution to a particular problem, rather it is a backup in the event that the crisis escalates further or is not addressed as quickly as we would like from an Irish perspective.  We must still make considerable progress.  We had an opportunity earlier - I am sure we will have an opportunity tomorrow in the debate on the European Stability Mechanism - to discuss further the measures needed across Europe.  There is a concentration this week on these measures and I hope we can continue the dialogue in the coming weeks.  It is only through a continuance of that dialogue, both here and throughout Europe, that some changes will be brought to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">We must look at the potential for growth and associated policies.  While the French are taking a lead role, it is important that we continue to set out our platform and ideas.  While I do not want to be critical of the Minister, I am certainly critical of the Government as a whole in being relatively lethargic in addressing that component of the recovery stream.  Without an appropriate growth strategy, we have little chance of addressing the stock of debt the State has accrued.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">We must also look at significant reform of the ECB and in so doing so we must talk about its capacity to purchase sovereign bonds in the primary market.  I was taken to some extent by what the Governor of the ECB, Mr. Dragi, said, not today but one week ago, that it was time for political leaders across Europe to decide what role they wanted the ECB to play and what character and format it needed to take.  He said that was not a decision for him or the board of governors, rather that it rested within the remit of the political leaders.  That was a refreshing statement which clearly showed a mindset within the ECB that there was a recognition that it could do more, that it could do things differently but not without a political mandate.  The political leaders need to look to the ECB to be able to guarantee deposits across Europe in order that we will not have fluctuations or the movement of capital, as has been seen in Spain and by us.  Probably the reason Ireland was bounced so quickly into a bailout was the reserves within the banking system here needed to be protected.  We have seen the flight of in the region of €100 billion from the Spanish financial system.  That makes it impossible for the banking system to survive in the coming weeks or months without some changes being made in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">We need to look at the issue of eurobonds and project bonds, an issue I addressed with the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  We need a direct approach by the Government on how it will be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">We must be careful in what we say, both inside and outside the House, about the approach we will take in an effort to ensure pressure is brought to bear on Chancellor Merkel.  There has been a suggestion made by some, as I understand it, within the Labour Party that we should challenge the Chancellor to the point where we would put it to her that we would be prepared to leave the euro, print money and go back to using the pound.  Anyone who has studied anything in this regard will know that that would have a hugely negative impact.  It would lead to a run on our banks and put our membership of the European Union in jeopardy.  It would also impact on the rate of inflation significantly.  We are a major importer of fossil fuels and a range of other goods and we would see their prices sky-rocket.  We need, therefore, to put that suggestion to bed.  We will leave it to a certain fringe element which is not taken very seriously on these issues.  Certainly, we do not need to hear it from any of the main parties in this House which claim to be pro-European.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_779">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill which obviously my party will be supporting.  More importantly, my party welcomes the decision of the people in the recent referendum.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, says a great deal.  I suppose when he says a great deal, one is inclined to agree with parts of it and disagree with others.  One part I found quite amusing early on was that referendums were a little awkward because often many of the issues discussed were not ones related to a particular referendum.  When the treaty campaign started, it was evident that most of the issues not covered in the treaty were being introduced by those who were opposed to it in the referendum.  There is a referendum commission to adjudicate on what is in and what is not included, but after this referendum we almost should establish a truth commission because there was nothing but lies and deception propagated throughout the country by various groupings which claimed to be political parties with responsibilities, yet at the same time they were instilling fear and causing confusion everywhere they went.  It should be stated clearly in the House that this, to say the least, is dishonest campaigning.  The holding of a referendum is very important in Ireland.  It can change the Constitution which the people hold dear as their last protection.  Nevertheless, certain political parties in the House and groupings which claim to be loose affiliates of socialists have wandered throughout the countryside telling bare-faced untruths to the people.  They have tried to sow confusion and fear.  In fairness, this time the people stood back and analysed the position.  They voted not necessarily in their best interests but in the interests of the country.  I could never understand the argument put forward by those opposing the referendum.  They claimed it would legalise austerity for many years.  The European Stability Mechanism establishes a fund to ensure countries which many be unable to access financial markets will have the ability to source funding elsewhere to pay for the delivery of services and the running of the state.  If we did not have the ESM we would be at the mercy of the people who, according to those opposed to the treaty, got us into this difficulty in the first place.  We would be dependent on the capital markets.  We are told continually that those in the capital markets caused the difficulties because capitalism is blatantly a flawed philosophy.  If that were the case all the people who voted "No" or who supported that campaign should have supported the establishment of the ESM to ensure we were not at the mercy of the vulture capitalists, as they are eloquently called from time to time by Deputies opposed to the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I wish to return to what this is all about.  Fundamentally, this is about ensuring we have a facility to access funds in the event of our not being able to go back to the markets when we exit the current programme in 2013.  Had we voted "No" it would have made it more difficult for the Government and the State to access markets in the years ahead.  There would have been a dramatic dislocation in society because we would have had vast cuts to social welfare, health and education.  That is not fear mongering or scare-mongering.  It is a fact.  We would not have had the capacity to fund the State on a daily basis.  The establishment of the ESM is a positive step taken by the European Union.  Some may suggest it is a belated step and I have been critical of the European Union and the ECB as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The role of the ECB should be changed to make it more proactive in terms of investment and acting as the lender of last resort.  Clearly, the riding instructions and the establishment of the ECB relate primarily to controlling inflation at the cost of everything else.  The Government should be to the fore in examining the ECB, its role and whether it should be expanded to ensure it can see beyond inflation control as its single remit.  This should be put at the heart of the agenda.  We are well aware there are inherent flaws in the euro mechanism.  This is because there are many banks with many regulatory systems but, at the same time, only one central bank which keeps control of the purse strings<i>per se</i>.  However, if a bank in a given country runs into trouble and is important to the stability of the economy of that country, the sovereign is forced to bail it out.  I accept the view of the “No” camp that this is inherently unfair but one cannot avoid something at all costs because it is unfair.  The fact is we need a functioning banking system in a modern economy.  If we let all the banks fail then we would have a basket case economy.  It is inherently unfair that the Irish person is asked to shoulder the complete burden of private debt.  It is inherently wrong as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The Government has a mandate in this regard.  Those now in government did not have to wait for a treaty to secure a mandate.  They were given a mandate last year by the people to go forth and re-negotiate.  They promised they would do so.  Prior to the election they stated that they would burn bondholders and diminish private debt and the burden on citizens.  The Tánaiste said he would take his battle to Frankfurt.  The only man who has taken the battle to Frankfurt so far is the<i>Irish Examiner</i> reporter, Diarmuid O’Flynn, who is there with 15 people from Ballyhea protesting outside the ECB at present.  The Tánaiste has not gone there yet.  Those in government need not have waited for this referendum to pass to strengthen their belief that they were doing the right thing by seeking a reduction of private debt.  They promised the people last year that they would reduce it if they were elected.  They got elected but the promises have diminished.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_793">We know why the interest rate reduction came about.  It was because other economies were struggling and they were given a reduced rate of interest as well.  The<i>quid pro quo</i> was given to Ireland subsequently.  In the interests of ensuring this country can access markets and stand on its own two feet as quickly as possible, the Government must negotiate with the mandate it was given last year on this issue.  However, there are conflicting views coming from the Government continually.  The Minister of State can dismiss me as much as she wishes but some Ministers have stated the matter is inherently linked to a “Yes” vote and that if we received a “Yes” vote it would strengthen our hand in any re-negotiation of the debt burden in Europe.  Some weeks ago the Taoiseach stated he would not have “defaulter” written on his forehead.  I am unsure who is right or wrong but these statements are not compatible.  We need a strong Government to do this work and, rather than have a quick chat with Chancellor Merkel on the telephone, we need solid diplomacy at its best.  We need the Government to plead the case in the context of the promissory notes and the private debt saddled on the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The European Union has an obligation to stand with smaller countries.  Reference has been made to a partnership approach.  No one country runs the European Union.   It is a partnership approach and the European Commission has failed dismally.  It is the most castrated organisation I have seen in a long time.  Effectively, it is non-existent.  First, there was the Merkel Sarkozy axis and now we have the Merkel Hollande axis.  Under the various European treaties the European Union has an obligation to uphold and vindicate the rights of smaller countries.  This is written in the treaties but the Commission has failed abysmally.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">We need a resolution to this issue and the quicker it happens, the better for Ireland and Europe.  I put it to the Minister of State that her Government is saying opposite things at the same time and this is having a negative impact on the view the people have of Europe.  More important, it gives the Europeans and those opposed to addressing the issues underlying our difficulties an opportunity to opt out and not give us what we believe to be fair and just, that is, a re-negotiation to lighten the burden on the people and the country in order that it can return to prosperity and start contributing again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_796">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The Bill amends Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to allow for the setting up of the ESM.  It also facilitates the protocol on the temporary adjustment of the number of MEPs, which will apply to the current European Parliament the additional seats provided under the Lisbon treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Bill is an important step in moving forward and building on last week's referendum result.  I commend the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs on her work during the campaign.  She sent out a positive message.  It was not negative.  She has done excellent work for us in her role and I expect she will continue to do so in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I welcome the result overall and especially the result in my constituency of Clare, where there was a 65.73% "Yes" vote, above the national average of 60.2%.  This is the sixth highest "Yes" vote in the country.  From speaking to people during the campaign, it is clear they were aware of the importance of passing the fiscal treaty in terms of Ireland's future role in the European Union.  The strong message they delivered last week was that they want to remain at the very heart of Europe and to see stability restored to the eurozone.  I reject the argument made by a sizeable number of campaigners against the treaty that people made their decision on the basis of fear.  Such nonsense does our intelligence and informed electorate a disservice.  Voters weighed up the pros and cons of the treaty before casting their votes and set aside their financial suffering and pain for the greater good of the country.  Their decision is to be commended.  While they recognised that the treaty is not a quick fix for our economic ills, they wanted the Government to have a strong hand and they recognised that economic recovery hinges on events internationally, particularly the outcome of the general election in Greece on 17 June, elections in France later this month and the banking crisis in Spain, which is dominating news coverage this week and may dominate the headlines next week.  The situation is highly volatile.  People were also conscious of the important role of foreign direct investment in creating jobs.  In voting for the treaty they sought to ensure that no damage was inflicted on Ireland's international credibility now that international confidence in the country is at an all time high.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The resounding "Yes" vote has been greeted positively throughout the world.  I have received a number of calls from people in Europe and in the United States congratulating us on the result.  Deputy Kelleher's statement that we do not have a strong voice in Europe is incorrect.  Our voice is heard in Europe and we have a strong team of diplomats working abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">When people went to the polls last week they considered how the international markets would react to a "No" vote and where we would obtain finance in the event that the country is unable to return to the markets at the end of the bailout programme.  International commentary on the referendum outcome reveals the extent to which the markets and European leaders were holding their breath as they awaited the result.  According to the French newspaper,<i>Le Monde</i>, the vote meant the fiscal treaty overcame a “perilous obstacle”.  The German magazine, <i>Der Spiegel</i>, described the result as “a rare piece of good news for European Leaders”, while <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> argued that the outcome strengthened the country’s European credentials.  <i>The Washington Post </i>stated the treaty “won a decisive and much-needed victory in Ireland in a closely watched referendum”.  It was important, therefore, that Ireland sent out the right signals to Europe and to the world, especially given our strong dependence on foreign direct investment. </p>
          <p eId="para_801">The President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, described the outcome of the referendum as an "important step towards recovery and stability".  In light of the international response to the result, there is no doubt rejection of the treaty in the referendum would have sent shockwaves through the financial markets and we would have been denied access to funding on the markets.  The question as to whether we will be able to return to the markets at the conclusion of the bailout programme, as hoped, will be determined by the financial markets.  For this reason, stability and a resolution to the euro crisis will be critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The economy is performing well and Ireland is on track to meet all the requirements of the European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout programme.  Our exports are performing well, with the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office showing that industrial production increased by 1.3% in April, a clear signal that the economy is recovering.  Yesterday's Exchequer returns were also highly encouraging.  If they continue on their current trajectory, the country will be in a strong position next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The main problem facing the economy is the slump in the eurozone.  It is important to expand our markets, particularly in countries outside the European Union, including emerging economies.  I was recently asked to open a conference organised by the Shannon Chamber of Commerce to discuss opportunities for enhancing our economic and tourism ties with China.  The event, which was held at Shannon Airport, built on last February's highly successful visit of the Vice President of China, Mr. Xi Jinping, during which he visited Lynch's farm in Sixmilebridge where a new born calf was named in his honour.  The Vice President's visit has placed Irish agricultural exports on the map in China.  For the past two years, food exports have expanded by 25%, with food and drink exports to China worth nearly €200 million in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The potential for export growth to emerging markets is significant and we must have a presence in these countries.  I pay tribute to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland whose representatives continue to work closely with high profile trade delegations and missions.  Trade missions, of which there have been a number recently led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, are very important.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, will lead a mission to Russia in the near future.   A direct air link between China and Ireland would advance ties between our two countries and I hope the new board of Shannon Airport will examine this possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">G7 finance ministers met yesterday to discuss the ongoing crisis, particularly developments in Spain, and vowed to continue to monitor financial developments ahead of the G20 summit in Mexico on 18 and 19 June.  A move to address the banking crisis in the European Union is on everybody's lips amid intense speculation that the Spanish banks will need a bailout.  At its meeting in Frankfurt today, the board of the European Central Bank announced it would maintain interest rates at their current record low of 1%.  While this is a welcome decision, all eyes are focused on how the European Union and European Central Bank will address developments in Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">While the vote of confidence in the fiscal treaty has strengthened the Government's hand in negotiations at EU level, as the Taoiseach noted this morning, there are no simple or quick fix solutions.  Buoyed up by the outcome of the referendum, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance are now in a stronger position to make the case that the issue of banking debt must be addressed and there must be a<i>quid pro quo</i> for Ireland in any resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">It is also important that Europe brings clarity to the issue of banking because failure to do so would dampen prospects for the introduction of a growth package.  A reduction in our debt ratio and the introduction of further growth measures will be critical if we are to make a significant dent in our unemployment figures.  This is a major challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">By voting "Yes" last week, the electorate demonstrated it is well aware of the challenges that lie ahead for the economy.  Voters knew they were voting to have an insurance policy which would ensure the country has access to the European Stability Mechanism.  It still may be possible to return to the markets by 2013, as planned.  The enactment of the European Stability Mechanism Bill will mark an important step in ensuring Irish people's wishes are adhered to and the bailout fund is put in place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_809">We are debating this legislation in the aftermath of the referendum on the fiscal treaty last week, the outcome of which I welcome.  As some of my colleagues have referred parochially to their constituencies, I can have the indulgence of a few seconds to say how pleased I am that my constituency of Dublin South returned the highest "Yes" vote in the country at 76%, notwithstanding the rather late intervention of an independent Deputy in the constituency, whose intervention in the last few days of the campaign was described in some quarters of the press as constituting a game changer.  Perhaps it did change the game, but not in the direction intended by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">This debate is a relatively net issue in the Bill, although the Government is also taking the opportunity to include another couple of important aspects.  Principally we are debating the amendment to article 136 of the treaty.  I would have a lot more sympathy for colleagues who were complaining earlier about the guillotine in this debate if there were arguments of substance being put forward as to why we should not support this Bill and not agree to what is being proposed.  Having listened reasonably carefully for most of the afternoon, I cannot identify any argument of substance other than the general argument to the effect that we do not want anything to do with all that, and that we know we are against it before we even read it.  That is to what these arguments amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I take a slightly different view from some of my Government colleagues on the "Yes" side.  While I agree there were strong reasons inherent in the referendum proposal which justified a "Yes" vote, it still constituted a relatively modest proposal to the people.  This is because many of the measures which the change in the Constitution will allow the Government to endorse are already in place.  Amidst all of the noise of the past three or four weeks, that point was missed.  Those on the "No" side now have a difficulty facing up to the consequences of the arguments they made at the time, and this was evident earlier in Deputy Daly's speech.  The Deputy pressed the Tánaiste on what the Government would now do, given that the people had agreed to amend the Constitution.  She correctly pointed out that the amendment to the Constitution is a permissive, enabling amendment that will allow the State to ratify the treaty.  It was claimed that many rules would be put into the Constitution if the referendum were passed, but of course none of those rules was put into the Constitution.  Do those on the "No" side still hold to the view that what the people did last week was to enshrine austerity permanently in our Constitution?  Are they seriously saying the Irish people gave a mandate to permanent austerity last week?  If that is what they think happened last week, they will have problems with their politics in future, because that is not what happened, and that was not what the people were asked to do, in spite of the claims on some of the "No" posters.   The people agreed to permit the State to ratify this treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Deputy Daly stated today that it was pointless setting up a fund like this because if Spain goes down, it will use up all of it, or at least the lion's share of it.  Even if she is right - I do not think she is - how is that an argument for not having a fund?  She stated that Ireland would have to contribute to it.  The countries have to contribute to the fund because they are setting it up.  We cannot conjure money out of the air, although perhaps Deputy Daly and her colleagues think we can.  The most extraordinary argument of all was Deputy Daly's point that the setting up of the fund would itself push us towards a second bailout. From where do these people get these arguments?  Surely they must be embarrassed when making such points.  What possible argument is being advanced to the Irish people?</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Deputy Daly's comments were reflective of the nature, tone and content of the arguments made in the past four weeks.  I said the proposal put to the Irish people was modest, but the decisive reason for the victory of the "Yes" side was what the "No" side were saying.  Perhaps I am alone in thinking that, but I believe the "No" side won it for the "Yes" side.  When people read the proposal initially they probably thought it was modest and not much about which to be enthusiastic.  However, they had to listen to arguments from the "No" side, with all the untruths and the misrepresentations in the teeth of what the treaty said.  For example, the argument was made that there would be no conditionality on funding in the future.   We were urged by Deputy Boyd Barrett and others to forget that part of it.  Reference was made to selective quotations on the treaty.  People are not stupid.  They were able to see they were being told "porkies" by the "No" side.  The truth was being misrepresented to them by many on that side.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Sinn Féin has come around to supporting the Bill, which is to be welcomed.  There would be no logic to its position if it were not to do so.  However, some colleagues remain here who think we ought not go ahead with this proposal, but have offered few arguments to support that position.  Deputy Daly complained that people are always asking where will the money come from.  She does not want that question to be asked.  It is a hard question for her and for her colleagues, and it is useless saying that people are asking the wrong question.  Deputy Daly and her colleagues have not answered the question because they cannot answer it.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Deputy Finian McGrath made the point earlier that there is a certain amount of sleep walking going on across Europe on where the Union and the eurozone are headed. He is right on that.  There has been a lamentable incrementalist approach to change in recent months.  There has been a paralysis of decision making, which is regrettable.  It may now mean that change will have to happen very quickly.  People have said we are at a fork in the road and that the European project, and certainly the eurozone, will go one way or the other - either towards closer integration or towards break up.  We have managed to arrive at this binary dilemma and it is one way or the other.  If I am right that it is a choice between one route or the other, those who advocate that we should not take the more integrationist approach have also got a responsibility to propose to the Irish people what they think ought to happen to our country in the future.  They cannot keep saying this is the wrong question.  Deputy Daly talks about the Government being naïve, but the perspective she has been advocating in this House is devoid of credibility as an alternative analysis for the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Let us join in the politics of what needs to happen.  I am pleased Francois Hollande was elected in France.  I do not agree with some of my colleagues who say it does not change very much and that growth was already on the agenda.  I know growth was already on the agenda, but the Sarkozy-Merkel political approach to what constitutes growth has been ruptured by that election, and that is a good thing.  It changes the conversation about what needs to be done for growth, and I wish colleagues would get involved in that debate rather than turning their backs on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">The idea that it was the arguments of the "No" side that led to the passing of the referendum is an interesting analysis.  It gives little credit to the arguments of the "Yes" side and is not borne out by the facts.  The polls showed that the percentages on the "Yes" and "No" sides did not shift from the beginning of the campaign to the end.  It looks as though the arguments pretty much cancelled each other out, from the beginning to the end.  Deputy White made an interesting political jibe but it does not stand up to scrutiny or to the evidence of polls taken consistently from the beginning to the end of the campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The issue was always the fear of the consequences of voting "No".  The Government and the "Yes" side traded on fear of the unknown, of the dire consequences of funds not being available to the State, of money not coming out of ATM machines and of pensions and social welfare not being paid.  That is the message the Government gave and that ordinary people got.  It is the message canvassers heard on the doorsteps from people who were intending to vote "Yes".  They were afraid.  Fear was whipped up relentlessly by the "Yes" side throughout the campaign.  A significant proportion of those who voted "Yes" did so with a heavy heart because they were angry at being asked to carry the can for the crimes of others in the Irish financial and political systems and for the greed of developers, speculators and others.  They voted "Yes" with a heavy heart because they were afraid of the consequences of a "No" vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">There were mixed opinions on the "No" side, but the United Left Alliance has a clear alternative.  Unlike the Government and the "Yes" side, we do not promise ridiculous fairytales such as investment, stability and certainty.  No one can promise those.  We did not promise them.  The "Yes" side did.</p>

That is very likely.  It is also likely that a Greek exit would tip the eurozone further into recession and, possibly, into a depression.  No one really knows.

Figures emerged in recent weeks showing multinationals in Europe sitting on between €2 trillion and €3 trillion worth of uninvested profits.  Why are they not investing?  It is because they do not think they can make a profit.  Why do not think they can make a profit?  It is because the demand in the economy has collapsed and they do not think they can sell their goods.</p>

That means tackling the wealth through corporation tax, taxes on financial transactions and taxing the obscene wealth of a tiny minority who control disproportionate amounts of wealth and reinvesting it in society and in the economy.  In contrast to that - a genuinely alternative approach to organising our economy - our Government, along with Mrs. Angela Merkel, cling on the dogma and doctrine of austerity which has failed miserably for the past four years.</p>

The hole in the Spanish banks is likely to be anywhere between €100 billion and €250 billion, probably closer to the latter figure.  We will have to contribute to that fund, after contributing billions to bail out our own insolvent banks whose reckless gambling and speculation caused the crisis in the first place.  We will now have to bail out the Spanish banks, the French banks and German banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_898">When will we stop bailing out the banks and start to adopt a different approach where we prioritise people, jobs, economic growth and employment?  The Government defends its position by saying that at least there is talk in Europe now of there being assistance to the banks that will not be channelled through the sovereign and will not be unloaded onto the backs of ordinary citizens and the books of member states.  That is the Government's big play after the referendum, that it is hoping that the ground is shifting in Europe and that we will be able possibly to ride on the back of whatever Spain gets in the hope that we can get a retrospective deal on bank debt.  However, Mrs. Angela Merkel responded to the Government's appeals only days after it had done what she demanded it do in passing the fiscal treaty and said: "Nein, nein, nein."  While that is German for "No, no, no.", it could equally be the 999 emergency number we will need to ring for the European economy if we keep going down the road of this disastrous austerity.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">At what point will the Government get it?  It has taken the best boy in the class routine to the most extreme lengths in pushing through this treaty when other forces in Europe are at least delaying it or beginning to question Mrs. Merkel's strategy.  The Government continues with the best boy in the class routine and only a few days after this country passed the fiscal treaty, Mrs. Merkel slaps the Government in the face again.  There has been no reward, no deal on bank debt, no change to the terms of the austerity arrangements and she has made it clear that Germany insists that ordinary citizens, working people - the vulnerable - will continue to pay the price of the crisis in the system.  All of the assistance will be strictly conditional - that is the key term: "strictly conditional" - on continuing with the poison of austerity inflicted on ordinary people.  When will the Government learn that trying to suck up to Mrs. Angela Merkel and the austerity boot boys of the troika is not working?  The more one encourages her to think there is no end to the punishment we are willing to take, the more she dishes out the punishment.  Despite saying the Government is supporting the forces in Europe that are now calling for a growth and jobs agenda in Europe, the reality is that by ramming the fiscal treaty through with such speed and now the ESM, in particular in the case of the latter which is not being discussed, it is undermining and sabotaging the forces in Europe that are beginning to challenge Frau Merkel.</p>

The Government wants to ram it through to prove again to Mrs. Angela Merkel what good boys and girls we are.  There will be no discussion on it despite the fact the ESM has profound implications.  Throughout the referendum debate the Government presented the ESM as if it was some sort of benevolent fund which was there to assist the people when there was so much more involved in it.  Whether one agrees or disagrees, it is utterly dishonest to suggest that is all there is to it, that it is just an insurance policy or a benevolent fund.  Serious issues arise from the ESM that must be debated properly.  It would be utterly dishonest of the Government to say the people of this country are acquainted in any serious way with the contents of the ESM treaty because they are not.  It has not been discussed.</p>

There is no question about that - through fear in my opinion - but the Government did win the debate.  However, it is dishonest to suggest there has been a full public discussion of the serious issues that arise out of the ESM because it is not just a benevolent fund.  It raises serious questions about the potential cost to the State of establishing the ESM in the event of a further bank meltdown across the eurozone, which is now looking seriously likely given what is happening in Spain and the knock-on effects we are likely to see in France and elsewhere.  To be honest, there could be a call on the State of €11 billion or more.  This is what the treaty allows.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012.  It is particularly apt to be discussing a European Bill following the recent adoption of the fiscal treaty by the Irish people.  The relief among my constituents is palpable.  I was in Drogheda on constituency work this morning and it is fair to say people were delighted the referendum was passed.  An air of confidence is starting to creep back into society.  People believe the Government has taken some hard decisions for the good of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Honesty of endeavour and hard work is what the country needs.  Tough decisions have been taken, but the Government was not elected to take the easy options or to avoid issues and pander to the masses in a popularity contest.  The Government was elected to put Ireland firmly back on the road to economic recovery.  That is what we are doing.  People recognised that passing the fiscal treaty was part of that process and voted strongly for it.  The Irish electorate are intelligent and sophisticated voters.  They do not stand for mediocrity and demand the best from their elected leaders.  By passing the treaty, they have endorsed the Government's actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Last weekend in Collon, I was reminded there had been a fall in the yield on Irish two-year bonds in reaction to the "Yes" vote.  This is the type of reaction that is required.  That the markets reacted positively is a clear sign the "Yes" vote has been welcomed.  I do not mean welcomed for the sake of it, as markets are anything but sentimental.  Rather, the vote put Ireland on a sound footing and removed a great deal of uncertainty.  As we all know, markets do not like uncertainty.  They have also voted, in that they have reduced Government bond yields, which is a strong endorsement of the Irish Government and people for backing the fiscal treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Last week while canvassing in Dundalk, there was a constant and simple message from my constituents.  While they did not like on a personal level many of the decisions that had been taken, they realised those decisions had been taken for the good of the country.  As a result, they understood and respected the decisions.  They realised taking a tough decision now would ensure a better future.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Dundalk and the greater Louth area have seen an upsurge of international companies locating there since the formation of this Government.  It is not a coincidence.  Those companies can now plan more confidently for the future and new companies looking to locate in Ireland will be greatly encouraged by the decision of the Irish people.  The veil of uncertainty has been lifted and Ireland is firmly on the road to recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 to provide for a number of measures to form part of the domestic law of the State.  One is the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which provides a legal underpinning to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  The other is a protocol on the temporary adjustment of the number of MEPs.  I have no hesitation in commending this Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_918">I have not been able to follow the Council statements or this debate because I have been attending a committee meeting.  If we are to be more efficient and to participate properly in the workings of this House, we could make another improvement to our work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">When the second Lisbon referendum was passed, the consensus was there had been a change from the inward examination of what Europe was trying to achieve, whether integration was improving or whether European functionality needed to change.  The idea became one of whether the EU was performing outwardly, that is, in its foreign relations and other aspects of its work.  As we now know, that analysis was wrong.  Our relationship with Europe and the European project is continuing to change, particularly in terms of its internal functionality.  It is a fact of our relationship with Europe that we proceed via referendum, in that we consult the people on the main issues of the day before we continue.  We will consult them again in the near future, as it is certain there is more to come in our quest to save the euro.  There must be.  However, we do not need to march blindly on, wondering what changes may come and when, and only discussing them at the last minute in the pressure of a referendum campaign in which other interests and political motivations come into play.  A significant shift in the functioning of the EU is under way through these efforts to make the currency union viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">It is time we started discussing the end game, what the currency union should be for us and for Europe and what we are willing to do to achieve it.  We need to discuss our vision for Europe and our place in it.  We now have the room to have that discussion.  We passed the stability treaty and our funding post 2013 is secure.  As elected Members, it is important we begin the discussion on what the euro will look like in the coming years.  We have a fiscal stability plan, but currency unions, euro bonds and the ESM directly intervening in Europe's banking system require more than that.  They require more than just coherence of planning.  They at least require coherence in fiscal instruments, if not some sort of central control of the fiscal levers of the State.  This was mentioned at the outset of the euro project, but it is only being understood now.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">It is time we figure out where we stand on some of the key taxation issues if we are to understand and chart the right direction for the future of Europe with us at its core in the euro.  We have stated we will not move on the financial transaction tax without our UK partners, as we would not want to put the IFSC at a competitive disadvantage.  The UK is not inside the euro and will face different questions than the ones we face.  We have stated our corporation tax rate of 12.5% is sacrosanct, which is true.  However, would we agree to changing it if we were offered a forgiveness of our banking debt in return?  This question deserves consideration, even if control was only given up in principle.  If we do not give up any control of our taxation measures, it will have implications for the path we will chart in Europe and for the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">These are key questions, given the direction Europe is taking, led by Chancellor Merkel.  It is better and more prudent to prepare ourselves and Europe for that future now.  A larger referendum is sure to be held in the next few years.  We need the euro to survive and it is time to start asking ourselves honest questions about what we are willing to do to ensure its survival and our own with it.  I raise this issue now because the constitutional convention is to begin its work shortly.  This is an important question for the convention to consider.  As a priority, the convention should deliberate on Europe and where we want to be in it.  Putting this question at the top of the convention's agenda would make sense.  It would also make sense were the Dáil to establish a committee to examine the same issues in tandem.  If Europe is moving towards a fiscal union of one form or another, be it a single taxation system or a commonality of taxation policies, we must know what it might look like in order that we can start preparing and decide what we want from it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Conlan</from>
          <p eId="para_923">This Bill is an essential instrument of legislation, as it facilitates the establishment of the ESM.  Economic and monetary union was always going to call for some element of budgetary discipline among participating states.  Originally, this area was regulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.  However, that mechanism lost its influence largely by 2005 and collapsed when the Schröder and Chirac Administrations in Germany and France, respectively, proved unwilling to allow the sanctions ordained by the pact to apply to their countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">A state of inactivity reigned until the EU was faced with the catastrophic events that led to the necessity for the 2010 Greek bailout and the subsequent need for temporary rescue measures to address emerging problems in Ireland and Portugal.  These measures relied on Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU which in actual fact had only ever been intended as a balance or escape clause to counter the principles as established in Article 125(1) of the same treaty which is known as the no bailout clause.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Events in Germany, where a case challenging the financing of the Greek bailout highlighted deep public opposition to the transfer of funds to less fiscally responsible states, presented a case where such transfers may have become impossible.  This, coupled with the possibility of mayhem breaking out in the markets when the current bailout agreements terminated in 2013, led the German Chancellor to address the situation which was beginning to have the capacity to wreck the whole euro project.  The current legislation, while having its genesis in the Deauville declaration of October 2010 where the Sarkozy-Merkel team first attempted to confront the worsening situation by regaining control of budgetary disciplines within the euro area, is a more refined instrument.  It is aimed at identifying the problems and addressing them in a more pragmatic and less knee-jerk fashion with the endorsement of each participating member required before the amendments take effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">This legislation before the House is the result of much negotiation and is essential to the economic well-being of the euro area and, indeed, beyond.  It is an instrument whereby all participating members can achieve stability in their economies and avoid the excessive fluctuations of both interest and currency rates which adversely affect business, both domestic and international, and, as a result, cause widespread unemployment resulting in large-scale mortgage defaults and misery.  It offers to us further affordable funding and protection from excessive interest rates, should they prevail.  This is essential to our recovery and to the protection of the very fabric of our society.  We must embrace this legislation and identify it for what it is, namely, an instrument of stability, of support in terrible times and of delivery to ensure this catastrophe can never again manifest itself in our national economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Regarding the amendments to Protocol No. 36 of the Lisbon treaty, it is clear, as in all matters, that a state of flux cannot prevail.  A thing either grows and develops to compensate for changing circumstances or it fades and dies.  This amendment is a temporary measure seeking to deliver the provision of extra seats, temporarily allocated to properly selected representatives, to make their representation possible.  In doing so, it will cure a temporary glitch which has occurred as a result of the timing of the Lisbon treaty and the European elections.  It is correct that we display the flexibility to address such matters and present a vibrant and growing EU.</p>

          <p eId="para_930">Irish voters, with no difficulty, said they are in a difficult spot, recognised the writing on the wall and made a difficult decision to support the treaty.  There is nothing easy about this as these are tough times.  The voting public came to a decision not reluctantly but because they felt it was in their and the country's best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The allegations tossed around like a battering ram by Deputy Boyd Barrett and others that austerity was invented by the Government to punish the people are far from the reality.  We are in a difficult situation which we inherited.  I am not blaming anyone for it but that is the reality.  The Government and the people have been called upon to deliver in the most difficult circumstances ever experienced in the history of the State.  We should all take pride in the fact the Irish people rose up in the majority last week and made a clear decision they wanted stability, reality and to move forward.  They did not enjoy it.  They are suffering and they know we know they are suffering but they made that decision to accept the treaty for a very good reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">There is one matter in which the country can give a lead.  The recognition for political convergence that existed across Europe over the decades has waned in the face of these difficult times.  Individual member states have sought refuge in their own revisited nationalism.  That is not a good way to go.  There is a great responsibility to give the lead in Europe.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has done tremendous work in this area, as well as all Ministers and the majority of Members.  There is a job to be done in giving the lead in Europe and taking responsibility for our part in European issues and affairs.  That is what the people bestowed on us last week.  Each member state must also make its contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Someone referred earlier to sucking up to the German Chancellor.  The German people have made many sacrifices over recent years which seem to go unnoticed.  The people of this country are also making significant sacrifices.  There is simply no manna from heaven or some mechanism that can allow us live in the lap of luxury.  We ended up where we are through bad management, bad housekeeping and overspending.  Those who profess to know an easier and softer option are not living with reality.  The reality is that confidence is generated in the markets when they recognise those in charge mean business.  I believe the Irish people were clear in their views last week and made a clear and conscious decision in their own interests and for the whole European project, a decision on which they should be commended.  It was a courageous decision in difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Economic turbulence has a difficult history across Europe.  Even a cursory examination of history will show that when economic instability occurs, along with it comes suspicion, aggression, blame and worse.  We must be careful and mindful of the circumstances in which this has happened.  In the course thereof, we should all now realise that we all have a contribution to make to modern Europe.  We know we can make a difference and we have shown others the way.  Next year's Irish term of the EU Presidency will be its most important since joining the Union.  It will fall to us to show other Europeans who may have second thoughts and think the European project is not working that it actually is.  Each member state must make its own contribution in whatever way it can.  Together, we the people across Europe will make the contribution that will see us out of our current economic difficulties.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_938">notes that the inordinate political influence which major developers and big builders exercised in this State over many decades resulting in a wholly inadequate regime of regulation, supervision and inspection in the construction industry, has left a disastrous legacy of defective buildings and major fire hazards, only recently coming to light;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_939">further notes in particular:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_940">— that the Building Control Act 1990, subsequent building regulations and building control regulations, reliant as they are on self-certification by building contractors, architects and engineers constrained only by legally ambiguous concepts such as ‘substantial compliance' with building regulations, are not and have not been fit for purpose; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_941">— that low inspection rates of buildings subject to commencement notices have been facilitated by successive governments since 1990, and that this has been further</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_942">compounded by the discarding of the clerk of works function under a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_943">acknowledges that the above has resulted in:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_944">— prioritisation of the interests of land speculators, developers, the construction industry and building professionals above the interests of families and individuals who purchased homes in good faith believing that the building regulations provided protection against bad builders;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_945">— the run-down of the already inadequate building control inspectorate by failing to recruit competent building inspectors;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_946">— housing developments throughout the State having been built with essentially no check on compliance with building regulations;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_947">— tens of thousands of families and individuals who purchased homes during the period since the introduction of building regulations in 1997 being left with no recourse against contractors and developers who sold houses which are now presenting with major structural damage due to pyrite induced heave, which could have been prevented by mandatory basic testing of quarry fill for heave potential and that such testing is still not mandatory in 2012;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_948">— fire safety being seriously compromised in many housing developments by faulty installation of fire stopping materials at party walls, roofs and in cavity walls;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_949">— the issuance of fire safety certificates prior to commencement of building without further inspection by building control being required during the construction to confirm that fire retarding materials and construction complied with the design drawings and fire safety building regulations;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_950">— permission to build timber frame housing and apartments up to four storeys high being granted without the necessary rigorous independent inspection of construction for fire</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_951">safety compliance;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_952">— signatures confirming ‘substantial compliance' with fire safety building regulations by contractors, timber frame subcontractors, architects and engineers employed by the developer being accepted as sufficient guarantee of fire safety compliance by the Dublin City Council fire officer in the case of the Belmayne development despite the fact that breaches of fire regulations identified were so serious that fire insurance was withdrawn;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_953">— certificates being signed by architects who may not have visited the site confirming ‘substantial compliance' with the building regulations to enable sale of housing units, leading to such disasters as that at the Priory Hall development;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_954">— foul sewer pipe lines having been backfilled without any check on line, level or pressure test or post-construction camera survey of the sewer lines; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_955">— sound insulation being so inadequate in semi-detached, terraced houses and apartments that people can hear conversations through separating walls;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_956">condemns the proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 for:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_957">— failing to provide any proposal for public inspection and remedial work to put right serious estate-wide defects including compromised fire safety caused due to failure of governments since 1990 to implement public building control on all buildings at all key stages of construction;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_958">— providing such an inadequate mandatory certification of compliance with building regulations, including lodgement of design drawings and calculations prior to commencement of construction, that it would not have prevented the pyrite disaster; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_959">— placing the burden of inspection and certification of compliance and legal responsibility on individual professionals who could not possibly inspect adequately without a continual presence on site of a resident engineer or clerk of works, while placing no responsibility on the developer to fund such a necessary presence on site;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_960">concludes that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_961">— the chosen inspection option demonstrates that this Government, like its predecessors, favours inadequate private sector checks rather than full inspection and approval of all buildings by local authority building control; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_962">— the penalties for serious non-compliance, which can lead to fatalities, are proposed to remain at the level of section 17(2) of the Building Control Act 1990, again reflecting the unwillingness of the Government to implement adequate sanction for offences at the behest of the construction industry's powerful lobby; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_963">resolves that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_964">— building control shall be a wholly public function, adequately staffed by competent building inspectors, involving inspections of all buildings requiring commencement notices and approval at all key stages of construction and with costs to be incorporated in planning contributions;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_965">— there should be a systematic and thorough inspection regime across the State to detect fire hazards as a result of inadequate regulation or non-compliance with such regulation as exists; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_966">— Government, having failed to implement building control and thereby allowing sub-standard and defective building practices throughout the State, must accept responsibility for necessary remedial works to make buildings safe and fit for purpose as part of an emergency programme of necessary public works and where possible to subsequently pursue the responsible developers and builders to recoup the cost for the State.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_969">This comprehensive motion is in the name of the five United Left Alliance Deputies and is supported by ten other Deputies in the Technical Group.  It deals with the plight of tens of thousands of home owners who purchased homes in good faith and then, agonisingly, over a period saw these homes disintegrating around them as they were affected by pyrite or the revelation of major non-compliance with fire prevention regulations, meaning they had to live with the constant fire hazard.  Meanwhile, the people in Priory Hall and some in Belmayne have been forced to move from their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">We move this motion in solidarity with those residents who are suffering the consequences of the problems which have emerged in the construction industry and home building in particular.  We especially insist on immediate action from this Government as this State has a serious responsibility for the matter which developed.  This nightmare has come about because of blatant non-compliance with mandatory building regulation, an utterly inadequate inspection regime to ensure compliance and inspection authorities which I see as blatantly negligent in some cases.  In the pyrite case, there is no regulation demanding the testing of the relevant building materials.  The Building Control Act 1990 and subsequent regulations relying on self-certification by builders, architects and engineers, bound only by an ambiguous concept of "substantial compliance", have proved utterly inadequate.  When combined with low inspection rates, this has given rise to a disastrous legacy for many home owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Incredibly, in the early 1990s, the Department of the Environment, as it was known then, issued guidelines to building control authorities for an inspection level of only 12% to 15% of new developments.  As the National Consumer Agency declares in a report produced in 2008 on building regulations and their enforcement, this means "in effect, up to 85% of newly constructed homes are not required to be inspected under the issued guidelines".  In Britain, Northern Ireland, the United States and many other jurisdictions, a 100% inspection rate is demanded.  Unfortunately, this is not accidental, as major developers and big builders wielded significant political influence in this State for many decades.  To put it bluntly, land speculators and developers had the Fianna Fáil Party in their pockets, with a substantial influence over Fine Gael as well.  These are the two major parties which have dominated the governance of this State since its foundation.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">This was before the outright corruption in the planning process during the 1980s and early 1990s was unmasked in the Mahon tribunal.  Just as the planning and rezoning process was distorted, so was the insistence on strict building regulations and adherence to those regulations.  It was fatally compromised by the significant political clout wielded over governments by the construction industry, with innocent home owners the victims of the corrupting nexus between big capitalists in the building industry and some major political parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The scandal of the Priory Hall fire hazard has been well publicised but the suffering of those home owners continues.  The position of another north-side residential development, Belmayne, is not as well known but it is also a major scandal.  Last year, residents engaged acoustic engineers to deal with intolerable noise travel in the Belmayne residences, and they discovered serious non-compliance with fire regulations.  The development in question is a four storey timber frame building, and the cavity walls and treatment of the areas between the ceilings of one apartment and those above is so inadequate that smoke and deadly carbon monoxide gas could spread rapidly through many adjoining apartments in the event of a fire.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">What is so shocking about Belmayne is the attitude taken by the fire authority in Dublin City Council.  Despite clear evidence of flagrant fire code violations, the authority gave the development the all-clear, even after having carried out an inspection on foot of a demand of some residents.  It was not until this year, because of the pressure from residents and independent fire hazard expert Mr. Noel Manning, that it was admitted there are problems in Belmayne.  Unfortunately, however, the remediation proposed is totally inadequate and the attitude of the local authority is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">I am alarmed and disappointed by the Minister's amendment to our motion.  The attitude he is adopting is utterly deplorable.  It is contemptuous of the huge suffering and problems of thousands of ordinary decent people.  It lacks any semblance of compassion or human feeling for those who are suffering and those who are fearful of the condition in which they live.  There is no solace whatsoever here for those people.  The Minister more or less says to carry on, it is business as usual.  There is no recognition of the moral responsibility of the State to play a key role in finding the solution.  Just as in other scandals and tragedies such as child abuse of children in care, the State has an ongoing responsibility and a moral duty because it did not insist on the necessary compliance.  It is incredible that the Minister intends to continue with the regime of only 10% to 15% of buildings being inspected.</p>

          <p eId="para_982">We demand the State should undertake responsibility for remedial work to make the homes safe for residents and then pursue the developers and recoup the costs.  That would be simple justice in this situation.  We demand a thorough regime of inspection right around the State, particularly to find fire hazards.  It is crucial this is done before there is an appalling tragedy and a fire claims the lives of innocent men, women and children.  It is critical we put in place a building control regime that operates as a public function present in every development and that every house and apartment is inspected in every stage of the building process so that the people who invest so much of their lives and savings in them can have some security and certainty for their lives and those of their families.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_983">I will concentrate on two aspects of the Private Members' motion tonight.  I thank the United Left Alliance for putting it together, particularly Deputy Clare Daly.  It is a motion on which I could speak for a long time but my time is limited and that is why I will concentrate on two areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">The appalling thing about the pyrite issue is that it was avoidable.  If there had been proper regulation, the crisis could have been largely avoided.  If a house were built today, however, it could present with the same problems because we have not addressed the problem in the interim.  Major suppliers are still unsure whether their products meet the required standards.  At best guidance is vague.  There is no excuse for not doing anything, even in the interim, about putting in place standards so no one else must suffer the same consequences as those who have bought homes with pyrite in them.  Many builders used low grade aggregates in the foundations to save money but there was good quality rock available.  There is evidence that the low quality of the rock has contributed significantly to the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">Unfortunately those who are worst affected by this are mostly young people who bought their first homes for multiples of the current value and in many cases they have young families.  This is very stressful for them.  Home owners with pyrite have been let down in a number of ways.  The were no standards for the materials used, there are professional experts who now deny pyrite ever existed anywhere else and there was a failure of self-regulation instead of rigorous oversight carried out by independent bodies.  HomeBond gave people an expectation that if everything else was wrong, its insurance would take responsibility but we now know HomeBond is washing its hands and pointing to failure at quarry level.  All of this has happened while the innocent parties in this are watching their homes falling apart around them with no plan of action.  I accept the pyrite panel has been put in place and acknowledge the role played by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">A constituent of mine sent me a report on pyrite in his house.  It stated that pyrite in the infill undergoes a chemical reaction to heat, moisture and the presence of calcium and oxygen.  These conditions, the report continues, are likely to occur under the floor slab and the resulting chemical reaction causes the stone infill to expand, which creates an increased volume leading to upward pressure that causes solid concrete floor slabs to heave upwards, applying pressure directly on to load bearing and partition walls.  The distorted doorways and cracking of internal partition walls are caused by timber stud walls being distorted by the upward pressure from the heaving floor.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">People are sitting in the full knowledge this is happening to the biggest investment they will ever make in their lives.  While pyrite does not have a direct impact on people's health, it certainly has a direct impact on their well-being, leading to extremely stressful living conditions.  The stress caused to them while they watch their homes disintegrate around them is obvious to anyone who has visited them.  They can show cracks and holes in the walls and warped floors.  It is unacceptable that the situation is continuing.  These people have unsustainable mortgages on homes that are now worthless.  Myself and others have met the pyrite panel on a couple of occasions and I know it is due to report in the next few weeks.  It would be useful if the Minister could indicate when that report will be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The people at fault in this must pay - the construction sector.  A management component must be put in place for the remediation of affected properties but the remediation must start in 2012 with a fixed timetable.  The work must be done to such a standard that lending institutions will not refuse lending and insurance companies will not refuse to insure the properties.  This problem cannot wait any longer because the longer it takes, the worse the damage.  We must learn from our mistakes and stop picking up the pieces left by rogue elements of the construction sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_989">The situation faced by those in Priory Hall and Belmayne and those whose houses were constructed with material containing pyrite is appalling.  This is not just about the tragic effects that has had on the residents, although the motion asks the Government to declare it will take the lead in providing the resources necessary to undertake the remedial works or transfers necessary to house these people in buildings of a proper standard and quality that are safe and to do whatever else is necessary to compensate them for the appalling position in which they find themselves through no fault of their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">The residents of Belmayne and Priory Hall and of houses containing pyrite are the tip of the iceberg and the United Left Alliance and the Technical Group are not the only people saying that.  There is considerable evidence that this is the case.  For example, the SEAI found that 93% of housing built between 1997 and 2002, which it examined, did not comply with regulations to reduce the risk of fire spread.  The director general of Engineers Ireland, John Power, described the findings as "truly appalling" and said that, "Priory Hall is symptomatic of what is likely to be a long line of disasters as a result of the lack of building control in this country".  That is the serious issue we are asking the Minister to address.  It potentially affects tens of thousands of people and results from a lack of compliance with building regulations by builders who were driven by nothing other than a profit frenzy to slap up substandard housing and apartments to make a fast buck regardless of the consequences for the people who bought them.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The failure of builders and developers resulting from their greed was compounded by the disgraceful failure of the building regulations themselves and the authorities that were supposed to enforce them.  It is incredible that houses built without complying with the regulations were inspected and, in many cases, passed.  How could that happen?  Clearly, the regulations failed and successive Governments failed to resource a proper building inspection regime.  All of this was facilitated by politicians who were beholden to developers and builders and who were addicted to a political and economic doctrine of deregulation.  The same doctrine and dogma deregulated the financial sector and crashed the financial system.  When the same doctrine was applied to housing, it resulted in a disaster for the people of Priory Hall and Belmayne, those with pyrite in their homes and tens of thousands of other homeowners who may not even know the full extent of the problems in their homes and the potential fire hazard they may face because we do not know the full extent of this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">This is the legacy of the Galway tent.  Fianna Fail Members should hang their heads in shame about what went on in that tent and what it led to by allowing cowboy builders and developers to run amok.  However, as the Mahon Tribunal report informed us, the political establishment generally was involved, particularly Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and they had a rotten relationship with builders and developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">All we are asking is that the Minister says he will do something for the residents of Priory Hall and Belmayne and those affected by pyrite and do more than what he proposes in his amendment to deal with the inadequate building regulations and inspection and enforcement regime.  When my colleagues and I spoke to builders on sites during the boom, they told us we were building the tenements of the future and there was no proper inspection regime on site.  They used to point to the old days - I do not know that much about building - when clerks of works were on site from the beginning to the end of a project monitoring every single stage of construction.  The State then moved to self-certification and deregulation and we have witnessed the dire consequences of that.  We need proper building regulations and a return to the regime where clerks of works are on site from the beginning of a project in order that it is not left up to profit-driven developers and builders to inspect themselves because that just does not work.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_994">On behalf of those who tabled the motion and those who support the motion, I welcome residents from Pyrite Action who are present in the Visitors Gallery.  They are living with this nightmare daily and they are entitled to know that the Government will take remedial action in this area.  Light touch regulation in the financial sector was a disaster while light touch regulation of employment has led to widespread non-compliance.  However, light touch building regulation has led to a nightmare for thousands of young families who purchased homes that are not fit to be lived in.  Developers and speculators have been prioritised for years over individuals and families.  There is no doubt there has been huge interplay between builders, speculators and developers and the main political parties for many a long year.  It probably started in the old days of TACA, which is not today or yesterday.  However, the many tribunals that have been held in recent years have shown publicly the huge influence and abuse of the interface between builders and speculators and politicians and the political system.  That has led to us discussing the plight of young families living in nightmare scenarios.  They not only have large mortgage repayments but many of them have mortgages for 30 and 40 years, which is a lifetime.  They are in negative equity, but many thousands of them live in homes that are falling apart at the seams or that are firetraps, which is the case in Priory Hall and Belmayne.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Dealing with such a situation on a daily basis gives rise to great stress and serious  heath risks for the families concerned.  The Government must take the initiative in providing for remedial works in these areas.  The developers and builders responsible for these various developments must be made to pay, but the Minister must take the initiative immediately.  The situation has gone on far too long and it is time the Government took effective action by ensuring remedial works commence promptly and are completed in an efficient fashion.  Above all, the Department must ensure it will recover the costs involved from those who are responsible for what happened during what can only be described as the disgraceful orgy by developers in recent years.  These are the same people who prevented implementation of the Kenny report recommendations on the price of building land many years ago.  Had they been implemented, the major difficulties we have encountered in recent years would at least have been alleviated, if not entirely prevented.  Even at that stage, in the early 1970s, the people concerned were using their political influence to ensure the Kenny report was left to gather dust.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_422">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_996">I thank my colleagues in the United Left Alliance for bringing forward this motion.  Having spent my whole life in the building industry, it is my view that the building regulations are very good.  The problem is that their enforcement has been extremely poor.  If the rules in place had been properly adhered to, the problems at Priory Hall and in developments like it would never have been allowed to occur.  While there is undoubtedly significant scope for regulatory change, proper implementation of the existing system would have prevented such failures.  Having looked over the apartments at Priory Hall, I can only say the place is a joke and a disaster.  That regulatory failures were allowed to happen across the board in this way is deeply unfair to the people who purchased the properties in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">While the whole business of construction encompasses a broad range of areas of responsibility, there is no doubt that the builder has by far the greatest responsibility.  The system of self-certification under which people sign off on their work is good, but the State, through the agency of the local authority, must have a role in terms of enforcement.  The engineer, for example, is responsible for the construction design, that is, deciding how the proposed structure will stay in place.  The mechanical and electrical consultant stands over what the electricians, plumbers and ventilation installers do.  Subcontractors then come on board, including specialist contractors who, for example, install windows.  The question then arises as to how those windows have been installed, whether the damp-proof course has been fitted properly and so on.  There is also the fire safety issue.  Every subcontractor on a building site should have to sign off on his or her work in the same way that the architect, engineer and mechanical and electrical consultant should have to.  Needless to say, the builder must also sign off on his or her work.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">All of the people mentioned require professional indemnity insurance.  A major difficulty is that we are seeing a large black hole because builders are going out of business and their insurance is dying with them.  The regulatory requirement is that public indemnity insurance must apply for six years following the completion of a project.  Where a builder is going out of business, there is an arrangement whereby the insurance will live on for six years at lower cost to the builder than if he or she were continuing in business.  The problem is that some builders who are broke do not bother doing this.  There should be a legal requirement on the liquidator in such instances, where a builder has ceased trading, to ensure the insurance is left in place once the bank moves in.  The latter, in turn, should have a legal obligation to ensure the insurance is in place in order that the six year period is covered in the event that serious problems with the building are subsequently discovered.  Professional indemnity insurance takes care of the matter once a project has been finished, but one must set up the run-off for the next six years if one is ceasing trading.  We must have a legal process in place to cover this.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The local authority must oversee all of the parties to whom I referred in order to ensure everybody is doing his or her work honestly and everything is covered.  All of the people concerned must sign off on their work and have the insurance to back it up, but without State involvement there is a serious deficiency.  To clarify, we will not put a stop to the activities of the rogue builder unless there are ongoing and comprehensive inspections.  There was never a situation in Ireland where all jobs were inspected.  We had the by-laws which were confined to the cities, while clerks of works dealt exclusively with State work.  If the Government is serious about dealing with the problems that have developed in recent years, there must be 100% supervision of what is happening on sites.  By my reckoning, this would add some €5,000 to the cost of every unit built in the country.  I would consider this a price worth paying, as I am sure would the people present in the Visitors Gallery.  The Minister will surely ask who should bear this cost.  I contend the State will have its work cut out in seeking to claim it would not be covered by the current levies.  If it is not, the Government should introduce a levy, payable when planning permission is granted, to cover the cost of 100% supervision.  The person supervising must have on-site experience of construction and an engineering background, although he or she does not necessarily have to be a chartered engineer.  The architects, surveyors, engineers and so on going onto a site all understand the principles involved in the work being done but do not necessarily know how it is all put together.  Most of them will say as much if they are prepared to tell the truth.  Their expertise is of a distinct type.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">I will not second-guess the Government because I am not sure what it is planning to do, but given what it brought forward last summer, it is looking to introduce paperwork.  I agree with this, but it will have to be paid for.  We do not need more bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork because we are getting carried away with ourselves as it is.  We need something which is realistic and applicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">In regard to asking the architect to submit working plan drawings, an architect designs a building and a number of areas are important to him or her when looking for planning permission, including external appearance, impact on the environment, use of the building and space.  If we are going to ask people to submit working plan drawings in advance, which is a good idea, we should not do so unless somebody is to check them.  If we do this, we must follow through to ensure the work is done that way.  If the drawings are done at the end to deal with adjustments made, we must check them also.  The local authority must check this work.  The State must take responsibility.  Expecting one person to sign off on it is nonsense.  We cannot ask an architect to sign off on anything other than his or her work.  We must let the others do their work which must be divided up.  Not only would architects not be able to take out insurance but we would also be throwing all our eggs into one basket.  There are at least six areas, of which the architect's is only one.  He or she can only sign off on his or her own work.  If he or she is forced to get involved in other areas not in his or her domain, there will be no small architectural firms in Ireland because only the large ones will be able to take out insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">To sort out the insurance problem, if we cannot put in place proper legislation to cover the six year period after someone goes out of business, we must introduce a bond system.  It would not be an ideal scenario because it would drive many out of business as they would not be able to obtain a bond.  It should be possible, however, to put a proper structure in place to cover the person signing off on work.  The State must take responsibility for what has happened in places such as Priory Hall because of the lack of oversight which allowed the deterioration of work standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">On the pyrite issue, HomeBond has walked.  I agree that the fault lies with the quarries, but do we expect people to chase them or Roadstone, one of the wealthiest companies on the planet and which has deep pockets?  HomeBond should have looked after the people affected, carried out the repairs and chased the quarries involved.  That is what would have happened in a proper and a fair system.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1027">— proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations have recently been released for public consultation and will provide for mandatory certification and the lodgement of drawings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy shane McEntee, and Deputy Peter Mathews.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">Recent high profile failures in the housing and construction sector have called into question the role of the State in this area, understandably so.  Self-regulation introduced by my predecessors has failed and I intend to change the regulations.  The proposed regulations are on public display.  The trust we placed in the professions to do this job was badly misplaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">My Department and I have a responsibility to guide and regulate development, but there is a point at which it is up to the professions and the industry to take over and ensure, as Deputy Mick Wallace said, that the planning, design and construction of the built environment is of the highest quality.  There is a robust system of building control and local authorities are successfully using their powers against non-compliant operators.  Of course, from a regulatory respective, there is much that can be done to improve the system and that is what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">In order to understand the arrangements in place for the control of building activity, it is first necessary to understand the provisions of the Building Control Act 1990 and how they may apply in practice.  The Act provided for the establishment of building control authorities and the making of building regulations and building control regulations for the construction of buildings.  The building regulations were introduced and came into operation in the years immediately following the Act and gradually enforcement arrangements were developed across the local government sector leading to the nationwide system of local building control authorities we have today.  A clear statutory framework for construction activity, underpinned by the Building Control Act 1990, is, therefore, in place and based on the following: clear legal standards as set out in the building regulations; detailed technical guidance documents to outline how these standards can be achieved in practice; the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers-builders, designers and building owners; a statutory responsibility for professionals to design in accordance with the building regulations; and the responsibility for enforcing compliance with the building regulations resting with the local building control authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The Act sets out clear roles and responsibilities for a number of parties, namely, the Minister, the owner-developer, building professionals, including designers in particular, and local building control authorities.  My role as Minister is to ensure appropriate statutory requirements, technical standards and administrative provisions are in place to give practical effect to the Act.  In particular, this involves the making of building regulations and building control regulations.  This aspect of the matter has generally worked well and is not in dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The building regulations set out the legally enforceable minimum requirements that a building must achieve.  The requirements are set out in 12 Parts, classified as Parts A to M, each of which addresses a key aspect of ensuring the safety and well-being of persons in and around the building.  A technical guidance document, TGD, is published to accompany each part indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.  Adherence to the approach outlined in a TGD is regarded as evidence of compliance with the requirements of the relevant part of the building regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The building control regulations deal with the administrative and procedural arrangements in place for the purpose of securing the implementation of, and compliance with, the requirements of the building regulations.  Contrary to common perception, I have no role in regard to enforcement activity which the Act of 1990 delegates to local building control authorities which are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">In regard to the owner-developer, the Act of 1990 places responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations first and foremost on the owner and the builder-developer of a building.  Where, for instance, an issue arises concerning non-compliance of a particular building with the building regulations, the Act enables the local building control authority to issue an enforcement notice on the owner and-or the builder.  The onus is on the builder and the owner to demonstrate compliance with the building regulations when required to do so by the relevant local building control authority.  Failure to do so is an offence under the Act which may, if successfully prosecuted in court, lead to a fine and-or a term of imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Remediation of defects is a matter between the parties concerned, that is, the owner and the builder-developer and their insurers.  This applies even where the owner is a local authority.  If a satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation, the option of seeking a civil legal remedy may be considered.  In such situations the statutory requirements provide a yardstick by which the owners or builders, their technical consultants and the courts can determine whether a building is fit for purpose.  The requirements of the building regulations apply to the design as well as the construction of a building and there is a responsibility on designers to ensure their designs are in compliance with the minimum legal requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">More generally, construction professionals play a key role in the planning, design and construction of the built environment.  Notwithstanding the responsibility of the Minister and the Department to guide and regulate development, the quality of the built environment depends to a large extent on the quality of the contribution of construction professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Construction professionals play a key role in designing, developing, and certifying buildings.  Where these buildings prove to be less than fit for purpose, construction professionals must be held to account for the consequences of their actions.  Such individuals should not be immune from criticism and should be held accountable for the consequences of their actions by society and their profession.  The lack of attention being paid to this objective reality by the professional bodies in their public statements, by media commentators and by members of both Houses in their contributions to proceedings is disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Under the Act of 1990, local authorities, as building control authorities, have strong powers to scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress, serve enforcement notices for non-compliance, institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements and seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Failure to comply with the requirements of the building regulations where a successful prosecution takes place may result, on summary prosecution, in a maximum fine of €5,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to six months, or both.  A further fine of €500 in respect of each day on which the offence is committed after summary conviction can also be applied.  A successful conviction on indictment may result in a maximum fine of €50,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to two years, or both.  Similar powers are additionally vested in local authorities under the legislative codes governing fire safety and planning and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Department has set a target inspection rate of 12% to 15% of all buildings covered by valid commencement notices.  Statistical returns for 2010 show that all but five building control authorities met or exceeded this target, and a general average inspection rate of 24% of all buildings was recorded.  However, I agree with Deputy Higgins that this is not acceptable.  The new code of practice will indicate the level of inspection by the relevant authorities later this year.  I assure the Deputy that staged inspections will be part of the new code.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Statutory processes such as those under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 and the relevant building control regulations in regard to applications for fire safety certificates and disability access certificates also enable local authorities to influence positively the quality of a building.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Problems at a number of developments, referred to by the Deputies, are already well known, and the Department is aware that local authorities across the country are using the powers currently available to them to address issues of building standards compliance, including in regard to fire safety.  While local authorities use the courts to effect compliance where it is reasonable and appropriate to do so, desired results can be, and often are, achieved through discussion and persuasion with the threat of legal action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">While the aforesaid sets out a brief overview of the existing arrangements in regard to building control, it is clear that, from a regulatory perspective, there is much that can be done to improve the system.  Unfortunately, many homeowners and tenants today understand this to their detriment as they have been left, through no fault of their own, to struggle with the consequences of unfinished estates, pyrite problems and defective buildings and developments.  The only appropriate response to such legacy issues in the longer term is to strengthen the system to ensure such problems do not visit us again.  In the short term, we must do everything possible to help those affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I recently announced a number of measures that will improve compliance with the requirements of the building regulations and oversight of construction activity.  Following extensive consideration of a number of reports and recommendations for change put forward by the Building Regulations Advisory Body and various industry stakeholders, which reports and recommendations were discussed in detail at various stakeholder consultation events, I announced in July 2011 my intention to proceed with the following measures: the commencement of section 6(2)(<i>a</i>)(i) of the Building Control Act 1990 requiring the submission to building control authorities of certificates of compliance with the building regulations in respect of particular buildings or works; the preparation of an amendment to the building control regulations that will set out the form of the proposed certificates of compliance and the administrative procedures that will govern their use, and require the lodgement of drawings and documentation prior to the commencement of works and again on completion of works, demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the building regulations; and engagement with the County and City Managers’ Association with a view to making arrangements for the move to a regionalised or shared services model for the administration of building control functions, the agreement of standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions and the meaningful oversight of building activity, and agreement on common measures for the support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The measures, when implemented, will represent a credible set of proposals that will lead to an enhanced system of building control that can be achieved in the short term and that will serve the interests of the consumer, the Government, industry and the built environment in a better manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">The key step will be the early introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance confirming, with appropriate documentary evidence, that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met for the building in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Unlike the worth of the opinions of compliance currently provided for conveyance purposes, which are not of course a part of the statutory building control process but are often misrepresented as being such, the worth of the mandatory certificate will be more in keeping with the asset concerned than the paper it is written on.  Mandatory certificates will mean what they say and will be signed by professionals who understand and accept their responsibilities and the liability that goes with the consequences of failing to meet those responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">Mandatory certification of itself depends on the integrity of those concerned and must therefore be coupled with more rigorous oversight of construction activity, as advocated by Deputy Wallace.  I have, therefore, approved proposals devised by my Department and County and City Managers' Association representatives that will involve more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity, standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions and better support and further development of the building control function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">Proposed building control (amendment) regulations were released for public consultation earlier this year which make provision for mandatory certification and the lodgement of drawings, as outlined earlier.  The closing date for submissions was 24 May 2012 and some 500 submissions have been received.  They are currently being assessed by my Department with a view to having a final set of regulations providing for mandatory certification and lodgement of drawings ready to be signed into law as soon as possible.  I am determined, after public consultation, to follow through with the planned reforms, which I believe will be capable of delivering the level of compliance with building regulations and the standard of quality buildings that members of the public so rightly expect and deserve.  In keeping with the standard procedures in regard to these matters, I have instructed my officials to continue to engage closely with key stakeholders to ensure the new regulations, when finalised, will be clearly understood and will work well for all concerned, with appropriate enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">I have outlined the statutory framework for building control which is in place and under which local authorities have strong powers to act against non-compliant operators.  Problems can and do arise, and in such cases I urge local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them with a view to ensuring defective homes or buildings can be made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">There is an urgent need for the professions in the industry and for builders and contractors and their representative groups to step up to the plate in delivering on their aspirations and their obligation to provide a reliable standard of professionalism and quality for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">I am taking the necessary steps to strengthen the system.  The set of measures outlined, including, in particular, mandatory certification, lodgement of drawing and more meaningful oversight of construction activity by local authorities, will be capable of ensuring stronger compliance with the requirements of the building regulations and homes and buildings of better quality for all.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneMcEntee" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Shane McEntee)</from>
          <p eId="para_1054">I thank the Minister for allowing me time to speak.  For at least five or six of the seven years in which I have been talking in this House about our good friends who have had trouble with their houses, nobody here wanted to listen.  I welcome this debate and welcome the motion and counter-motion.  The debate is bringing the matter to a head.  There are two issues being discussed, namely, moving forward in the building industry and sorting out the mess that exists.  Deputy Wallace correctly stated that there are enough regulations and that we would not be having this debate if they were implemented.  I have every confidence that my Minister's and the Department's work, with the support of a strong Opposition, will result in implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">The mess that exists represents a disaster, yet having been involved over recent years I realise it can be sorted out.  We have seen circumstances in which people accepted responsibility.  It sometimes took three or four years, at a cost of €22 million or €23 million.  Two companies fought tooth and nail in a court case, yet they ultimately had to fix the houses in question.  One has seen through the years where persons have hidden behind this court case, as it were, whereas some have gone about their business and sorted out the problems, in particular those with pyrite.  In the case of many, however, which is what we are dealing with now, there are builders who have gone into liquidation and where the onus is now on the banks.  There are builders who continue to work, profit and do well and who have ignored the problems and the plight of these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">Mr. Brendan Tuohy is heading up this report which will be issued and we will all receive the up-to-date information.  I look forward to what will happen when it issues in the next couple of weeks.  The Government has made it quite clear that it will not let people walk away from their responsibilities, as they are doing at the moment.  There are the banks which have blacklisted estates in my county and in other counties.  It is scandalous.  It is not acceptable for them to say they will deal with persons individually.  It is not acceptable for insurance companies to engage in delaying tactics by not paying out.  It is not acceptable for builders who are in business and want to continue in business to ignore the plight of these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">A minimum of 77 estates are suffering with pyrite.  If each estate is broken down into its own divisions, regardless of whether a bank, a builder or whoever is in control, each estate can be sorted out.  We, as a Government, know we have a responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">It was not the intention of some of these persons that this would happen.  Mention was made of those in houses that have been badly built.  Those were cowboy builders.  In some cases, however, there were very good builders who got caught in a situation, in particular, in the case of pyrite, which could have been dealt with in 2004, 2005 and 2006 when the issue arose.  While some have been caught, much could have been done in those years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">As I stated previously in this House, the situation was ignored by the previous Government, including by the Green Party.  Its members did not want to discuss it.  I and other Deputies, perhaps one or two of whom are present and some of whom are seated behind me, were ignored, the building was allowed to continue and there was no regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">There are two issues, one of which is moving forward.  We are at a lull in the building sector.  We have time to regulate and, as Deputy Wallace stated, to put in place a situation where enforcement is strict and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett stated, is applied from start to finish.  It can work.  We have a job to do that.  The building sector will come again.  One already sees the steadiness in my area and in the house market in the Dublin area.  We will need more houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">On the plight of those affected, I have gone beyond the emotion of it because I have been in the houses concerned and we have sorted them out, including bigger estates.  I would warn the banks, the builders, the insurance companies and the building federation that they will not be allowed hide on this one and they have a moral responsibility.  They know the Government will not foot the bill for everybody.  That cannot and will not be done, but those who are still in business can do it.  We have seen in Ashwood estate, where a liquidator was appointed, how the banks could act within two hours.  They stated they had no money to act.  They were able to act within two hours when the pressure was applied.  It is my intention, with the support of all in Government, to force these people to remedy the houses that have been damaged by pyrite, and not to do it in four or five years' time.  As I stated earlier, it can be done, estate by estate.  There are enough people and there is enough money within the sector still to fix these houses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterMathews" eId="spk_425">
          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews</from>
          <p eId="para_1062">I thank the Minister of State for sharing time.  It is helpful to step back from the legislative structuring and debate and merely think of the facts again.  These are persons who have been literally diddled.  Anybody who buys a car, a television or something as simple as a jumper that is not fit for purpose is legally entitled to a refund, and yet the residents of Priory Hall who spent €250,000 on their homes are being dumped with the bill because of a cowboy developer.  It is as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">The Irish Home Builders Association calculations suggest that €100,000 of the purchase price of each Priory Hall apartment went straight to the Government in taxation.  After paying such a staggering bill, the least the owners of Priory Hall apartments should be entitled to expect is that the State or the local authority would ensure these are safe to live in as the first port of call, and then the State or the local authority can go after the professions, the builders, the suppliers or whoever.  However, those who have had to empty their apartments of furniture and family need to be restituted immediately.  It is as simple as that.  Anybody who spends €250,000 on a home should feel assured that it is fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">In October last, the owners of 187 apartments were forced to empty their homes and move out.  Eight months later their plight is not over and their future remains unclear.  The developer, the banks and the local authority added insult to injury during this period, and the suggestion the local authority would pay owners €50,000 for apartments that cost €250,000 was a bizarre insult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The local authority then attempted to wash its hands of the problem in the Supreme Court.  This was not right.  The banks are less than enthusiastic at finding a resolution.  They are now attempting to deal with each apartment owner individually in a divide and conquer strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">As I stated, a first port of call is to deal with the problem and then start sorting the bill.  I agree with the Minister there are professional responsibilities, building and contracting companies and local authority responsibilities, but these people are entitled to be able to get back into a home.  That is to solve the problem and let us - the Government or the local authority - chase the responsible persons in due course, which will take two or three years, for the restitution of the cost of dealing with the problem immediately.  That is my suggestion.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland deals with motor accidents for uninsured drivers on that sort of basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1067">I welcome the opportunity to partake in this debate which is exceptionally important to so many.  I share the real and legitimate concerns which have been expressed during the debate to date because for any citizen of this country to purchase a home is one of the most significant events in that person's life or, indeed, the life of his or her family.  Many young people and new couples have found themselves in impossible situations as a result of the failure of the system and, ultimately, of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">I acknowledge at the start that we were over an hour into this debate until a little balance was brought into it by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  It must be pointed out - I do not hold any mandate for any vested interest and I come here like everybody else to represent the public - that there are many hard-working decent builders who have done honest jobs in building one-off houses and housing estates.  To listen to some of the contributions so far, it is a plague on every house that was ever built in this country.  That is wrong because there are many hard-working, honest builders, architects, plumbers, sub-contractors etc.  Unfortunately, there were many who were not honest and hard working and they engaged in a race to the bottom, primarily fuelled by greed.  It must be said there were many fine housing estates built.  Unfortunately, plenty did not meet the standard and that is the crux of the debate tonight.  I empathise and sympathise with the residents of Priory Hall and Belmayne and with those affected by the pyrite issue.  These people have been left in an impossible situation by the failure of the system.  As in the case of the hundreds of thousands of families, couples and people who find themselves in mortgage arrears and financial difficulties, there is now a complete and urgent onus on the Government to address the issues of mortgage arrears and personal debt arising from home ownership and the issues highlighted as a result of the Priory Hall, Belmayne and pyrite cases.  We need to have the information put in the public domain.  This is something I have called for previously but the information has not yet been furnished.  How many more Priory Hall situations have been brought to the attention of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government?  It would be useful and informative to know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The points made on self-certification and self-regulation are valid and they speak volumes.  A point not made to date is that a conflict of interest is at the centre of these self-certification and self-regulation systems that have operated in recent years.  Let us consider the situation with the banks.  The watchdogs of the banks were reliant and dependent on the client for fees and other ancillary businesses and, as a result, there was a conflict of interest.  Unfortunately, this extended to the construction industry and the building trade.  When architects and those who must sign off on certification are reliant on the person they must certify, when they must declare that their work is up to standard and when they rely on these people for their livelihoods and for the payment of fees, it is as plain as the noses on our faces that, ultimately, the system will come crashing down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">I refer to some of the political issues raised here tonight.  What I have to say will not come as news to anyone in the House.  I become blue in the face every time we have a discussion about construction and people lump in Fianna Fáil with the bad builders, practices and fund-raising and everything that goes on.  The Mahon report identified the Fianna Fáil party, the Fine Gael Party and one member of the Labour Party.  That was discussed and dealt with conclusively in the House.  However, what we are discussing tonight has been referred to by all speakers and it is ultimately the responsibility of the local authorities.  I do not state this for the benefit of anyone here but for the commentators outside who, every now and then, dip into what we discuss in the Chamber.  Between city and county councils there are 34 planning authorities in the country.  Some 22 of these 34 are controlled by a combination of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and in the majority of these cases this has been the position since the mid-1990s.  That is a fact and I am not making a political point about it.  The Mahon report dealt with certain matters up to 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">Ultimately, the local authorities have had responsibility for the oversight and implementation of the building regulations and planning policy in their areas as well as responsibility for zoning, local area plans, county and city development plans and all the various strategies.  Who was in charge of the majority of the local authorities?  Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in control in 22 of 34 authorities.  I will offer some examples.  Cavan County Council is controlled outright by Fine Gael.  Limerick Council is controlled outright by Fine Gael.  Mayo County Council is controlled outright by Fine Gael.  A combination of Fine Gael and the Labour Party controls Carlow County Council, Cork County Council and Dún Laoghaire County Council.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1080">I am referring to the majorities.  By the way, all of this is documented by the Oireachtas Library and research service.  The point is that the Government parties can point the fingers in any direction they wish.  Everyone has been responsible for it but it is now mainly Fine Gael and the Labour Party at local government level.  I simply wish to make that point.  I am not making it to the Deputies opposite because they know it and understand it is a fact.  However, many other people do not seem to understand that Fine Gael and the Labour Party have had significant control, input and influence at local authority level in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Another issue compounds the responsibility of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  There have been calls for several planning inquiries in several local authority areas throughout the country, including one in Waterford recently.  Where are they?  What is the problem with these?  Why can we not hold these planning inquiries?  Some of the complaints made to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government come from the Local Government Audit Service and the Ombudsman.  These are not coming from cranks on the street who want to waste public funds.  They come from credible State agencies and legitimate organisations which have a problem.  Why can we not have these planning inquiries?  Many low cost models could be adapted for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The proof of the pudding with the failure of self-certification and regulation has been the issue of taking estates in charge.  We all know that throughout the country there is a serious problem with the taking of estates in charge.  This is where the chickens are coming home to roost with the local authorities.  A Bill has been published in the name of a Deputy from the Labour Party and he is on the right track.  I had intended to publish such a Bill myself and, fair play to him, I believe we will support the recommendation he is getting to.  We must have a legislative timeframe for the taking of estates in charge throughout the local authority sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I am keen to see a new regulatory and inspection regime and for a national building inspectorate to be established which would inspect the majority of properties under construction in the country.  We need to have a system of licensing and the registration of builders.  We need to have full prosecutions for any of the designers or contractors who are negligent in their duties.  We are all aware that there has been a deficiency in this regard.  We should have an open register of inspections, prosecutions and reports of inspections made from the public.  A robust inspection regime should be implemented to ensure the people of Priory Hall and Belmayne never experience this again.  Information on builders, including rogue builders and those letting down the system, must be shared among local authorities.  This is not the case at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">We need to go further.  Where a builder has been granted permission for a major housing development we need to provide for a system whereby another permission will not be granted until the existing permission has been built out and completed to a satisfactory standard.  There was a rush to get on to the next development and to bag the profit that would come with it.  Article 10 of the proposed changes states that local authorities will be required to enter details of the certificates into a register but there is no reference to the local authority being required to carry out due diligence on the certificates.  At a minimum they should certify that the person carrying out the inspection is suitably qualified and properly indemnified.  All of us have had experience of such cases during the years of the building boom in the country.  A great many of those who were involved in lodging planning applications and acted as agents were not qualified.  This created a problem because many of those who were not qualified, albeit not all of them, were not up to the job.  This matter must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The provision under which a bond is lodged by the developer with the local authority must be regularised and made mandatory.  Discretion must be removed from local authorities in this regard and in pursuing enforcement they must act swiftly and call in bonds.  In the past they were not prepared to do so and take estates in charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">I welcome this debate as it allows me to record, for those who are less informed than Members of the Oireachtas, a fact relating to the involvement of the Fianna Fáil Party in planning since the period covered by the Mahon tribunal.  I commissioned research on this matter from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  The findings show that my party has not controlled the majority of local authorities since the mid-1990s.  One hears glib remarks about builders in the Fianna Fáil Party and the Galway tent.  Since my election to Limerick County Council in 2004, I have not once visited the Galway tent.  One would swear that some of the Deputies in the Technical Group have never been involved in a fund-raising event.  According to them, everything runs on fresh air, yet they receive unvouched leaders' allowances, which is worse.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_1088">I thank my colleagues in the Technical Group for raising this important issue through a well constructed motion which my party is pleased to support.  The motion contains a particularly succinct description of the manner in which the State has operated in prioritising wealth over the interests of the general public.  It clearly shows that those who had great fortune and influence were those on whom the State looked kindly, namely, those who oiled the Fianna Fáil TACA machine and greased the tills of the corrupt and negligent class of politicians which ran the country into the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">Actions speak louder than words.  These problems which resulted from the<i> laissez-faire</i> approach to regulating both the building industry and the most basic of safety regulations continued to plague those who unfortunately bought a home from a developer who knew everything about squeezing through loopholes and nothing about providing quality housing or social responsibility.  The reason the motion is before us is that we cannot allow these issues to remain unresolved and justice not to be served for such persons and all those who were placed in danger by the recklessness and negligence of legislators, regulators, developers and those who allowed the system to continue, went along with it or profited from it.  This problem, like many others related to the mismanagement of the State, comes as powers over issues such as planning and inspections are removed from locally based people charged with protecting the public good and vested in unaccountable bodies. </p>
          <p eId="para_1090">As the motion states, one particularly grave example of the failings of this light touch - to the point of being non-existent - approach to regulation is the disaster of Priory Hall.  I reiterate the solidarity greetings sent recently at Sinn Féin's annual Ard-Fheis in Killarney to the evacuated residents of Priority Hall.  A motion passed at the Ard-Fheis deplored the disgraceful conduct of the Priory Hall developer, Thomas McFeely, and his Coalport development company, which bear primary responsibility for the plight of the residents.  It also deplored the totally inadequate planning and fire safety regulations and lack of enforcement by the Government and local authorities which allowed such developers to act with impunity.  Sinn Féin called on all relevant banks and lending institutions to fully participate in the resolution process at Priory Hall chaired by Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan aimed at finding a solution for residents.  This solution must vindicate their rights to a home and not to be financially penalised as a result of gross negligence for which they do not bear responsibility.  In line with the motion, the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis called on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to empower and resource local authorities to carry out rigorous inspections of all housing developments and enforcement of all relevant planning, construction and fire safety laws and regulations to ensure we would not have a repetition of the Priory Hall scandal.  We must never again have a scenario in which, one year on from their evacuation, the Priory Hall residents remain in limbo, facing bankruptcy and without secure homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">Another example of the failure to properly support families who have been failed by the construction sector is found in my constituency of Dublin North-West and the surrounding areas where many people were sold homes contaminated with pyrite.  The properties of this substance render buildings unsound and the material has caused major problems for families who have wedded themselves to large debts to provide a home.  They have been left with a substandard construction which, in the interests of their safety, would be better demolished and replaced.  The homes in question were planned and approved, materials were purchased from quarries that were allowed to operate and the developer behind the scheme was allowed to bring the buildings to market despite their flawed construction.  This is a case of an obvious and glaring failure to ensure a product on the market, in this case a house, was safe and fit for purpose.  If any other product was involved, the body which allowed it to go to market would be held responsible and the victims of the failure to regulate properly and protect the public compensated and afforded justice.  I support the motion which I commend to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1092">This week the House is dealing with two Bills on European issues and the forthcoming European Council meeting, all of which are related to the current crisis.  I have lost count of the number of times the European Council has met to discuss solutions to the crisis without getting to the heart of the problem.  Tonight the House is discussing the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, the purpose of which is to amend the founding treaty.  A major debate on the European Stability Mechanism Bill has been ordered for tomorrow.  All of these debates roll into one and it is difficult to contribute to one of them without straying into the issues addressed in the other business because the issues are interrelated.  At the same time, we are failing to address the issue at the heart of the problem, namely, the private debt incurred by the State as a consequence of transforming bank debts into sovereign debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">I understand the reason people outside the House are bewildered by all of this.  Many of those who voted "Yes" in the referendum, including a large number who did so through gritted teeth, had great expectations that some positive signs would emerge from the European Union.  We were informed that telephone calls had been made to European leaders, yet news programmes are reporting that, when asked about debt relief in respect of the banking bailout in response to the "Yes" vote, the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi, stated: "I do not think there was any ground or any statement of a<i>quid pro quo</i>.”  In other words, the outcome of the referendum is not linked with the bank debt issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">He went on to say that the spread on government bonds had fallen further in Ireland than in other countries, which showed that "a return to market access is not a far distant perspective".  He said that Ireland had made substantial progress on fiscal restructuring and bank consolidation.  Mr. Draghi stated that the board of the IMF would be presented with a report on Spain this Friday.  The difference between us and Spain is that Spain is a big country.  Spain is a problem and we are not a problem, so there will be no rush to solve something that is not seen as a problem.  I think that was the point some of us were trying to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">I do not understand this Government's negotiating strategy, and we are signing up to things and making amendments to European treaties in the absence of any understanding of what that strategy might be.  I want to know what kind of European Union we are designing, because we are re-designing it at the moment.  I thought we belonged to a European Union that had values such as democracy, solidarity and cohesion, but these have been absent.  The German Chancellor proposed that countries in programmes would lose their entitlements to a veto and other things.  Obviously that proposal did not happen, but it shows a mindset.  In the absence of having something clearly spelled out about what exactly we are trying to create, how can we continue to plough ahead with amending treaties?</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">This will be brought to a head when it begins to affect Germany.  I was reading an article in<i>Der Spiegel</i> from 6 May, called “The End of Germany’s Illusions”.  This is the kind of thing that will bring people to their senses, because essentially there are creditor countries and there are debtor countries, and everything is being designed with the creditor countries in mind.  We are in a weak position and I do not understand why we are not trying to build solidarity among other debtor countries, but that is not happening.  The article in <i>Der Spiegel</i> opened with the following statement. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1097">Germany's booming economy and plummeting unemployment has long insulated the country from the euro crisis on Europe's periphery.  Those times, however, are coming to an end. The German economy is now showing it is vulnerable after all, and Chancellor Merkel will now be forced to make sacrifices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">I do no wish any country in Europe to make sacrifices, but there has to be an element of reality.  I have quoted a number of German people who are opposed to Chancellor Merkel.  The article goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1099">For Germans, it was always a crisis that belonged to others - the Greeks, Portuguese, Spanish and Italians.  That is, those who didn't have their finances in control and were expected to kindly atone for it by adopting the German model.  Back home in Germany, by contrast, the economy was booming and people had work.  In a sea of misery, Germany was an island of bliss.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">It is interesting to read that, even if it is not a Christian Democrat Union viewpoint, as this newspaper would not tend to be.  However, due to the two thirds majority required in the German Parliament, the CDU requires the Social Democratic Party to vote with them.  The article goes on to recommend letting go of power. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1101">Thus it is in Germany's interest to solve the life-threatening problems within the currency union both swiftly and sustainably.  But steps more radical than Germany has been willing to take will be necessary to achieve this - and that goes for both Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and the German people at large, who have vehemently rejected the prospect of their country having to give up any power or money to save the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">We can sit in here and talk in a vacuum, but things are moving very fast and attitudes are changing because they are being forced to change.  We were told we saved these banks on foot of an ECB instruction.  We saved them because we had to save the euro, and we were told that no European bank was going to fail.  We have been compliant for the troika and we have been compliant with our fiscal adjustments, which I think will be soon unsustainable, but we also acted in the interests of keeping a sustainable euro, and we have not had any serious return on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The principle of the ESM is not a bad one.  The idea of having a major amount of money that can be drawn down in a time of crisis and where each country contributes is a good idea in principle.  However, the problem is that there is no democratic oversight and many of the rules and regulations for the ESM are unacceptable as far as I am concerned.  This is obviously a fund for which there is a requirement to pay the money back.  It is difficult to understand what fund will be used to save the Spanish banks if it is not the ESM.  To be perfectly honest, people are making this up as they go along without any values that would give many of us a sense of inclusiveness.  I would like to go back to a stage where we did share some of those values, which were very noble, in the full knowledge that there will be pain.  I understand that we cannot avoid that pain, but in the debates this morning, this evening and tomorrow, which are all interrelated, we are not talking about the issues about which we should be talking.  We are not solving the problems we should be solving, and we are discussing them in the absence of knowing what will be created.  That is dangerous.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1104">I would like to pick up on some of the points made by Deputy Murphy.  She made a fair point when she asked what is the vision, or the end point, of the current crisis.  If there is not clarity, two things result.  First, people's confidence is undermined, here and now.  Second, it becomes difficult to evaluate any proposal because we do not know where it will end.  I agree with some of the points made by Deputy Murphy in this regard, although I disagree strongly with her in other areas.  As I listened to her and other contributors, I was struck by how well they summed up the tensions faced by the European project.  Those tensions are clear and emotional and, taken together, they pose a clear threat to the survival of the euro and of the political institutions beyond it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">I will point to two of those tensions.  First, people who are in bailout programmes do not want to be in them but countries that are paying for them do not want to pay for them either.  This clear conflict throws up a stark contrast when one meets people and politicians from many of the countries that are funding the programmes in which countries like ourselves are residing.  People in those countries do not want to pay for programmes.  They do not want to hand over money to other countries.  At the same time, we do not want to be in a programme.  We would rather get out of it.  Second, there is a clear tension in the euro and the eurozone itself.  Everyone who is inside the eurozone wants to stay in it, but not every country in the eurozone has the same idea of what it means to be a member of the eurozone and not all are willing to live up to the expectations of membership.  Because those two tensions are in play, the euro is facing a real crisis of legitimacy.  If those tensions are not resolved, the euro will not survive.  That is one of the reasons I campaigned for the treaty.  I see it as a prerequisite for the kind of change that needs to take place if the euro, as we know it, is to survive and prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">At the heart of what we are discussing is the fact that the euro, as it is constituted at present, is an unfinished currency.  For so long, the European economy was awash with cheap, global credit and experienced the benefits of a booming global economy.  Because of that, the fault lines in the euro were invisible, ignored or not acted upon.  Of the two fault lines, which are still there and whose consequences we are grappling with, one is political and one is economic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">The political fault line is in the fact that some members of the eurozone were happy to accept the benefits of membership but did not accept that any costs or responsibilities would be associated with it.  We saw this clearly in what happened to the Stability and Growth Pact.  More seriously, the chimera of economic growth, fuelled by cheap credit, allowed companies, governments and unions to take their eye off the ball when it came to the things that really mattered.  Productivity, competitiveness, good living standards and managing people well were all ignored, due to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">The economic fault line with which we are now grappling is that we had a currency union without a banking union.  The fateful mismatch between those two elements was the cause of much of the banking difficulty we are now experiencing.  We still do not have a Europe-wide banking deposit guarantee scheme that is credible and clearly understood by everyone.  We still do not have a Europe-wide banking regulator and we still do not have a Europe-wide banking resolution scheme that enables countries to deal with and manage what happens when a bank fails.  The absence of those elements of a banking union, alongside the existence of a currency union, created a horrific mismatch within which all the difficulties we are now dealing with bloomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">A common thread in both those failures was the fact that national Governments did not want to give up power in these areas.  They did not want banking regulation to leave their jurisdictions.  The same was true of fiscal policy.  Governments set up rules that they themselves would obey.  When those rules were breached, national political decisions outweighed the existing rules.  All of those decisions were made for reasons of national economic sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">We now find that the danger to our own economic sovereignty is far worse than we could have imagined when those decisions were made.  We must now be completely honest as to what the solution to these difficulties should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">One of the core reasons for our current difficulty is that we did not have an architecture that completed the single currency zone.  We did not have a banking union or the right rules and institutions for national budgets.  We are kidding ourselves, potentially to great historic cost, if we imagine that anything less than fixing those deficiencies will substitute for dealing with this crisis.  It would be a delusion, with consequences that we would rue for decades to come, not to face up to how we should deal with the two mismatches that occurred when the single currency zone was set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">Now, unfortunately, is the time when we must face up to the consequences of that mismatch.  Greece faces the prospect of a disorderly default on its budget, and I hope that country can avoid it.  It would be a catastrophe for Greece, and for us.  Some European political leaders who should know better are talking about the prospect of a country leaving the eurozone.  We see what is happening in Spain, where the banking system is too big to fail but too expensive for Spain to save on its own.  Because those mismatches were not dealt with when the eurozone was established, we are now dealing with those terrible consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">The Governor of the ECB, Mario Draghi, referred to this last week when he said the ECB on its own cannot fill a political vacuum.  That vacuum must be filled.  The two building blocks that need to be put in place are a banking union and a fiscal union.  Each will be very difficult and will pose huge challenges to countries like ourselves.  The lack of either, however, will prevent the putting in place of a comprehensive response and solution to a crisis that could wreck our Continent, politically and economically, for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The banking union would have four components, which many people are now beginning to talk about openly.  They are a banking recapitalisation fund, a fund for deposit insurance, a central regulator and a clear and established process for handling bank failure.  This may sound bland to us in Ireland, where we have seen how national regulators were unable to do their job of regulating our banking sector.  Many people in Ireland would welcome such a vista and those kinds of ideas.  In other countries, however, they will be powerfully and strongly resisted by governments and by elements of the banking sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">There were sound reasons these things were not wanted in the past, but there is a compelling reason now as to why they are vital, namely, that such a system gives us the best possible chance of surviving a bank run.  If one thing is capable of deepening the crisis we are in to levels that are unimaginable, it is the acceleration of a banking run where capital moves out of peripheral economies - I dislike using this terminology - to core economies, and credit and capital continue to flow out of weaker banks to stronger banks.  This country experienced elements of that in 2008 and 2009.  I struggle to see how any government or European-wide plan would get out of such a cycle once it was unleashed across the entire European economy.  I am encouraged by the fact the European Commission and the European Parliament are now talking about these ideas.  They were talking about a likely implementation date of 2015.  We might not have a euro as we know it now to defend by 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">The second element which must accompany the process is a fiscal union.  That is essential for the development of some form of European-wide mutual debt plan or eurobonds.  I must be careful in what I am talking about because fiscal union and all the issues that could be involved in such could be used as shorthand for people deciding how schools are built in some countries and how much money is spent in hospitals.  I do not speak about any of those matters.  I speak about a bare but clear form of fiscal union that would generate and allow some sovereign debt from participating countries to be backed up by all countries.  A plan has already been developed for that.  I refer to the "red debt-blue debt" model which was developed by the Bruegel institute.  It has been endorsed by the German Council of Economic Experts and last week was endorsed by<i>The Economist</i> as a clear way of moving forward on a challenge such as we face.  It involves participating countries deciding to jointly guarantee new sovereign debt issues of up to 60% of the national income of a country, after which the country would borrow on its own.  It is not at all the kind of system that some advocate where a group of countries would be responsible for the entire national debt of all countries.  What I speak about is a bare but solid plan where some countries would underpin the ability of other countries to issue debt in return for all of us being able to move out of the terrible crisis we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">All of that would be uncomfortable, even the bare plan I have sketched, as it would involve the further dilution of the economic sovereignty we enjoy.  In this country's case that could well mean future referenda.  Any of the points I have made, such as a new role for the European Central Bank, the creation of eurobonds and a new single banking regulator, would probably require treaty change which in our case would, thankfully, require a referendum.  As we contemplate the closure of one referendum campaign, the idea of future ones would make many, not least me, shiver at the prospect.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to a lack of vision for the future but I have outlined an alternative strategy that I believe would work.  It is a feasible future that has difficult consequences for the present and would entail us facing up to difficult choices.  If we do not have such discussions now, we will not have the kind of shared prosperous future that for so long we assumed would be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I wish to spell out equally what the proposal is not about.  This is not federalism.  I do not accept the economic crisis we are in requires a leap to some kind of political federalism where others get to determine Irish neutrality or our policy on non-economic matters.  This is not even a proposal for economic federalism.  What I do not propose is that any participating country would underwrite the full debt of another country.  I speak about a clear model in which sovereignty in some areas would continue to be shared.  To borrow a phrase from another part of our heritage and of our present, this is economic unionism, not economic federalism.  It is a case of looking at two challenges we must confront and saying the burden and the benefits are so big in each of those areas that we must share them in a way we have not done to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">I must also be clear in the proposal I make that this is not going to close our budget deficit.  It will not mean that the difficulties we have in the gap between our spending and taxation will shrink.  It will not mean that the other equal national crisis – the jobs crisis – will be improved by what I propose.  I simply suggest that if we do not complete the building blocks of the euro and we do not have a political discussion now on how that will be done, the point will come at which it will be either too late to do them or the vision of other people on how they should be done will be forced upon us.  We should avoid either scenario at nearly any cost.  The unionism to which I refer is now articulated and debated by many.  I hope this kind of thinking is the genesis of some of the things people are now talking about in public, for example, the European Commission last week.  I believe this country should play a crucial role in the Presidency and prior to it in talking about such matters with people within the Continent of Europe.  If there is one thing small states such as this country have been good at in the past and can be good at again in the future, it is thinking strategically, coming up with new ideas and building consensus on them.  We must do that, not just for the sake of people outside of Europe but for our own people, because there must be an end point involving a fair resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">I wish to sum up by referring to what an American economics professor, Mr. Andrew Moravcsik, has written in a recent article in<i>Foreign Affairs</i>.  He said: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1121">The burden must be shifted from Europe's public sectors and deficit countries to its private sectors and surplus countries.  If this does not occur the survival of the euro will be called into question and Europe will face a long-term economic catastrophe that could drain its wealth and power for the rest of this decade and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">I am not sure whether as he advocates that shifting is either possible or even merited but sharing is essential.  We are now at the truly dreadful crisis point that some predicted but which I hoped would not come, whereby if we do not fill in the gaps in the designs we put in place decades ago, it will result in their ruin, not just of national economies but of the political vision and values of solidarity and coming together that have been at the heart of the extraordinary progress the Continent has made in the past 60 years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1124">Okay.  I wish first to denounce the handling of these crucial European Union issues in Dáil Éireann.  The way the Government has approached the debate is scandalously inadequate.  The European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 has had approximately four hours of discussion today and, incredibly, the European Stability Mechanism Bill has been allocated approximately four and a half hours tomorrow.  This is incredible, given the serious import of these issues.  The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and what it means for the citizens of member states are questions that should be addressed in significant detail.  It is incredible, reckless and negligent of the Government to railroad the ESM through Dáil Éireann in the form of these two Bills in seven or eight hours.  Had we had a debate on these issues during the course of the recent referendum campaign on the fiscal austerity treaty, it would have been a preparation ahead of finalising the debate in Dáil Éireann.  Unfortunately, that was denied us as well because the Government refused to engage on the substance of the fiscal austerity treaty.  Instead, it browbeat us with the threat of no funding being available to the State in the event of emergency funding being required unless we passed the austerity treaty.  Although the gun to the head was couched in terms of access to the ESM, we did not get a chance to discuss the whys and wherefores of the workings of the ESM itself.  Instead of the type of elucidation that could have occurred in the recent debate, the majority of ordinary people in this State have been let down badly by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">The European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 provides for the implementation in domestic law of protocols relating to extra MEPs, but the provision with which we are most concerned is the European Council decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, including the creation of the ESM for the eurozone.  The United Left Alliance, ULA, opposes the current way in which the ESM is structured and will be used.  Since the Bill facilitates the establishment of the ESM, we oppose the Bill as well.  We do not oppose the idea of a solidarity fund were it for the benefit of the ordinary people of Europe, but the ESM is not that fund.  Rather, it is a fund to bail out and underpin the financial market system so that the latter can continue to exploit the majority of people and be an economic dictatorship over society, wielding inordinate power through unelected and faceless institutions and forces that are unaccountable to most ordinary people within the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">Be it in the US or Europe, everything that has been done by the political establishment since the financial crisis struck four or five years ago has been in the interests of the sharks who dominate the financial market system - the banks, hedge funds and various speculators.  The European political and economic establishment has reinforced the situation, with the troika arriving on our shores to ensure that the significant burden of bad gambling debts that were incurred by European speculators was placed on the shoulders of the Irish people.  Therefore, the establishment of the ESM as an emergency fund, potentially with a budget of €700 billion, is simply what happened to our people writ large across the participating states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">This Bill proposes the facilitation of the inclusion in domestic law of the amendment to Article 136 to allow the ESM to be established.  The amendment is being made to square the mechanism's establishment with Article 125 of the same treaty, which strictly forbids bailouts and member states financing one another.  Article 125 was no barrier to the European establishment when it wished to move rapidly to salvage its system through the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, which will continue in existence until the middle of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">It is clear that the amendment of Article 136 to allow for the ESM is an amendment of a fundamental treaty of the EU and requires unanimity among member states.  Therefore, the ABC of it means that each state has a veto on the matter.  Unfortunately, this point was not allowed to be clarified during the referendum debate because doing so would not have suited the Government's purpose.  Clarification would have emphasised the truth that the Government had a veto over the changing of Article 136, but the Government wanted to use the blackmail clause, that is, the requirement that the austerity treaty be ratified and passed to allow access to the ESM.  It was gravely dishonest to the Irish people to deny the fact that, in the event of a "No" vote, what was supposedly their Government could have told the EU that the latter would need to remove the blackmail clause if it wanted to proceed without its ESM plans being halted.  The Government denied that this was possible and, in so doing, did a considerable democratic disservice to our people.  The conduct of the austerity treaty campaign was scandalous in general, with the Government feeding fear at every turn.  Hence, this rushed two-day discussion in Dáil Éireann minus a proper airing of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The Government is rushing the legislation through and, as usual, is being dragged along in the slipstream of the political and economic establishment of the EU and the largest political group in the European Parliament, namely, the European People's Party, EPP, to which Fine Gael is affiliated.  Its economic policy is very right wing and neo-liberal and, accordingly, has a malign influence in the European Union, particularly through the agency of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, as the main policy dictating the economic measures in this State and across Europe.  The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is a fund not to benefit the ordinary people of Europe or to assist small enterprises which could employ millions across Europe.  It is about salvaging the markets and banking system as we know them.  This is a continuation of the process of the previous 20 years of what is called the financialisation of world capitalism where finance capital has come to have an inordinate predominance over manufacturing capital and other aspects to create the type of casino capitalism that has brought us the disaster into which the world is still plunged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">This has meant a savage austerity is now inflicted on working class people and the poor in many European countries.  The Greek working class is being crucified in the name of bailing out the financial system, as indeed are our people.  I heard a Member speaking earlier, along with much comment in the media, of the need to move to fiscal union to save the euro and the present system.  Fiscal union on the basis of capitalism in the European Union is a pipe dream.  It will never happen because the national interest of the big businesses and financial institutions in each member state will come between that.  Europe is 150 or 200 years too late to establish some sort of a federal system as in the United States of America.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">There is the socialist alternative.  Several striking articles in<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i> in March referred to the incredible amounts of uninvested profits that are being hoarded by European corporations.  The ratio of investment to gross domestic product in Europe is at a 60 year low.  Why?  It is because companies sit on €2 trillion in uninvested profits across the eurozone and £750 billion in the United Kingdom.  This is an incredible failure of the system.  Massive funds sitting in banks, speculating etc. while 25 million people are unemployed in the European Union.  The alternative to that is not the bailout of the financial market system as envisaged in the ESM.  The socialist alternative is that this wealth should be taxed massively or taken into public ownership, like the major financial institutions, and run democratically in the interests of the greater good.  This alternative is the only system that will get us out of this appalling vista of austerity which brings about more crisis and suffering.  A socialist planned economy under a workers’ democracy could bring a genuine international perspective and a genuine sharing based on solidarity with the peoples of Europe.  On the basis of the present system, that is absolutely ruled out.  In no way does this Bill reflect the interests of ordinary people in this country or in Europe.  Accordingly, we are opposing it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy John Perry)</from>
          <p eId="para_1132">I warmly welcome today's extensive Second Stage reading of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Throughout this afternoon and evening, the House has heard from a range of voices from all sides which is very welcome.  The debate will serve us well as the Bill goes forward next week to Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Before we draw the debate to a close, I want to recall the essence of this legislation.  At its core the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 provides a means of incorporating several developments at European Union level into the domestic law of the State.  As well as being legally necessary in each instance, I welcome also the opportunity afforded by the consideration of EU-related legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such legislation affords the Oireachtas an important opportunity to further engagement with and debate on EU-related issues of importance to Ireland.  In a sense, this legislation is bringing home key EU developments to our national Parliament and our law.  This necessary process serves as a concrete link between what goes on in Europe and what happens here at home, as well as how those developments are translated into the State's domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The timing of today's debate is most welcome.  Over the past month, we have had a vigorous and energetic debate in this House and across the country leading up to last Thursday's referendum vote.  While the specifics of the stability treaty were under scrutiny during the referendum campaign, and rightly so, our engagement with our neighbours and partners in Europe, particularly with those with whom we share a common currency, formed an important context for that debate.  I am greatly heartened that the citizens of Ireland responded in such a resounding manner last week.  I am gratified the people saw the stability treaty for what it is, namely, an important element of the solution to addressing the economic and financial crisis which has gripped Europe and beyond for several years now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">The stability treaty and its provisions are not the whole story but it is an important element of the solution.  The stability agenda must now be complemented by a growth agenda, which delivers sustainable growth and jobs for the European economy and for the people of Europe, especially our younger people.  From dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises, I know that 200,000 small companies employ 1.8 million people.  It is about jobs and confidence.  Deputy Higgins would be well-served if he engaged with some of these companies.  All the key employers were enthusiastic about supporting last week's referendum.  Small businesses are the backbone of the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1137">The growth agenda has been pressed by the Government since coming to office last year.  I welcome this critical issue which has now gathered considerable traction among EU leaders and we will be working hard to ensure that these efforts show dividends in Ireland and across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">The people's vote last week strengthens the Government's hand as we now pursue the growth agenda, including at the European Council summit meeting towards the end of this month.  A key element in restoring stability to our common currency area has been the steps to put in place robust and convincing financial firewalls, firstly in the form of a temporary mechanism, the European financial stability facility, EFSF, and now with a permanent mechanism, the ESM.  Of course, the Bill before the House has a direct link with the stability treaty through the provision concerning the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which will provide a legal underpinning for the ESM which is to enter into force next month.  It is for that reason that the Bill was published on 8 May in tandem with the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 which I understand will be considered by the House tomorrow.  The Government wanted to ensure the people had the full picture available to them when they came to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">I will recap on the contents of the Bill.  It provides for the amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to provide that the protocol amending the protocol on transitional provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and that the European Council decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for member states the currency of which is the euro shall form part of the domestic law of the State.  I will briefly recall what is involved in both instruments before concluding by recapping on the amendments the Government will bring forward on Committee Stage next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The protocol on transitional measures on the composition of the European Parliament puts in place temporary arrangements for the level of representation in the European Parliament during the current Parliament's term running from 2009 to 2014.  The measure ensures 12 member states are fully and appropriately represented in the European Parliament.  Since it was elected in 2009, before the Lisbon treaty had entered into force, EU leaders agreed that it would be only fair that those countries that would benefit from 18 additional seats in the Parliament under the provisions of the Lisbon treaty should have access to that representation during the current term.  Ireland's allocation of MEPs was not impacted on by this protocol which entered into force on 1 December 2011, following ratification by all 27 member states.  It should be noted that the effect of the protocol is entirely temporary and that the size of the next European Parliament to be elected in 2014 will be as provided for in the Lisbon treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">As I mentioned, the purpose of the European Council decision to amend Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union was to provide a legal underpinning for the ESM, which is to enter into force next month.  The Government firmly believes membership of and access to the ESM are fundamentally in the interests of the country.  As was clearly set out during the referendum campaign, the ESM will serve as a kind of insurance policy; we hope we do not have to use it, but in agreeing to ratify the stability treaty we have secured access to it.  It, therefore, makes a great deal of sense that we should provide an appropriate legal underpinning for the ESM treaty through this amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">I will recall for the benefit of the House the Government's intention to introduce two amendments to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  These amendments which will be introduced next week on Committee Stage will provide for the Croatian accession treaty and the Irish legal guarantees protocol to form part of the domestic law of the State through amendments to the European Communities Act 1972.  The amendment to provide for the accession of Croatia will, if adopted, allow us to proceed to ratify the Croatian accession treaty.  It was encouraging to hear such strong support for the accession of Croatia expressed during today's debate across the House.  Croatia's accession process is not yet complete.  Monitoring by the European Commission of a number of outstanding commitments which Croatia must fulfil before it accedes will continue.  Before July 2013, the proposed date of accession, reforms must continue, new laws will need to be adopted and others implemented.  The Commission will closely monitor Croatia's fulfilment of all its commitments across many aspects of the<i>acquis</i> but under particular scrutiny are Croatia’s commitments in the areas of the judiciary and fundamental rights and competition policy.  Monitoring reports will be submitted to the Council working groups on a regular basis, with the last of these due during Ireland’s Presidency of the European Union.  On 29 May the General Affairs Council considered the first of the Commission’s reports.  The Council noted that Croatia’s preparations for EU membership were on track and that Croatia had reached a considerable degree of alignment with the <i>acquis</i>.  At that Council meeting the Commission indicated it would continue to work with Croatia to address the limited number of outstanding issues.  I am confident that Croatia will continue to show the perseverance, hard work and determination that have got it this far in the process.  As it holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of next year, I expect to see Ireland preside over the final discussions on Croatia’s fulfilment of its commitments and pave the way for its accession.  I also look forward to welcoming Croatia as a full partner in the European Union and believe its presence among us will be to our mutual benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The second amendment which the Government will move to the Bill next week concerns the protocol on the concerns of the people on the Lisbon treaty.  Whereas the substance of the protocol dates to June 2009 when the European Council took a decision to address Irish concerns about the treaty, the protocol was only signed in Brussels on 16 May.  EU leaders agreed in 2009 that the provisions of their decision would be set out in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty.  Thus, with progress on the Croatian accession treaty came progress on our protocol.  The target date for entry into force of our protocol is the middle of 2013, at which time it is hoped Croatia will become a full member state.  The promise made to the people will be fully honoured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">I appreciate the engagement of Members throughout the debate and look forward to consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage next week.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1261">The arts, culture and heritage sectors continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a very wide range of activities.  It can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and can also encompass areas which flow from such artistic pursuits.  It may also embody the whole industrial creative sectors, including the audiovisual production sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">The Government appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.  The Deputy will be aware that a report (<i>An Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Arts in Ireland) </i>  published by the Arts Council in 2011 indicated that the arts sector provides significant direct and indirect employment, supporting some 21,300 jobs and contributing €306.8 million in taxes.  The arts also impact on the wider creative industries, contributing €4.7 billion to the economy and supporting 79,000 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">The heritage area is also increasingly identified as a primary stimulus in the tourism sector and my Department is committed to promoting greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's rich heritage as a valuable amenity for business, farming and tourism and as a means of presenting Ireland as an attractive destination for sustainable inward investment.  A report published by the Heritage Council last month indicates that Ireland's historic environment supports over 35,000 jobs and contributes in the order of €1.5 billion to the national economy.  It also indicates that one fifth of total visitor expenditure in Ireland is attributable to our historic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">While the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the agencies under its remit, have primary responsibility for the promotion of Ireland generally as an attractive visitor location, heritage sites, including national parks and national monuments, feature strongly in much of this promotion.  In addition, my Department through, for example, the provision of important heritage inventories, the funding for the conservation and presentation of the built heritage, and through support for the Heritage Council, assists in promoting greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's heritage as a valuable amenity for residents and visitors alike.  My Department is also directly involved in developing heritage initiatives with Fáilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and other organisations.  I am confident that these and other initiatives will contribute to the quality of the national heritage tourism product, economic recovery and job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">As the Deputy will be aware, in the Government's<i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, there are 11 specific actions in the areas of arts, culture and creative enterprise which are to be undertaken by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the agencies under its remit. The relevant actions are set out in section 7 of the Plan and I look forward to continuing progress in relation to these actions in the period ahead.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1270">The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit, and I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, such investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector and their potential for assisting with cultural tourism initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">I was pleased to recently launch The Philanthropy Leverage Initiative. This initiative, established with funding of €230,000 for 2012, is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources. The scheme aims to promote support for the arts from private sources and to unlock 2 to 5 times the funding put up by the taxpayer. The Philanthropy Leverage Initiative will provide an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative will be available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms. The Leverage Initiative will run in parallel with a second initiative — the Philanthropy Capacity Building Initiative — which is operated by the Arts Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">Capital investment in cultural infrastructure has greatly improved access to and participation in the arts for large numbers of people nationwide.  Facilities funded include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, studios and creative and performance spaces.  In this manner, my Department provided the bulk of capital funding for buildings and refurbishing arts facilities around the country, mainly in the not for profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue support for many of the facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">In terms of indirect funding, my Department, in conjunction with the Arts Council, has developed an initiative called<i>Culturefox</i>, which is a free promotional medium for arts and culture events.  <i>Culturefox</i>  is both a website and an “app”, and is available to all arts and culture practitioners at national, regional and at local levels.  It is free to use for promoters and consumers alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">As the Deputy is aware, I also forwarded details to him on 25 April last of financial assistance provided to bodies/groups over the period since the establishment of my Department on 2 June 2011.</p>

Tógadh an cinneadh sin mar chuid de<i>Phlean Athchóirithe an Rialtais don tSeirbhís Phoiblí</i>.

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1293">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 489 and 491 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">Earlier this year, at the request of the Government, Mr. Conor Skehan, Chairman of the Peatlands Council, convened a Peatlands Forum, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, and involving my Department, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Bord na Móna, and representatives of turf-cutting and environmental groups. This Forum allowed each community affected by the cessation of turf-cutting to put forward their views on the issues and follow-up steps were identified for each bog.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">The report on the Forum from Justice Quirke also recommended that a national plan should be prepared to examine how the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation are to be protected. This recommendation was agreed to by Government. Dáil Éireann also gave unanimous support to a Private Members' Motion, which called for such a national plan to be put in place. On the 3rd of April, I, together with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, T.D., met with EU Environment Commissioner Potoènik in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. This plan will be developed over the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">The plan will be wide-ranging, looking at the practical aspects of conserving and managing the affected bogs and will allow solutions for turf-cutters to be explored in detail. In the context of such a plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites. The plan will be progressed both at local level for each site and through the Peatlands Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">An extension to the "derogation" is not legally possible. While the Plan is being prepared, no unauthorised turf cutting can take place on the protected bogs. Any unauthorised cutting will be dealt with through prosecution and cross-reporting. The State may also pursue contractors and turf-cutters involved in illegal damage to meet remediation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">The Government has put in place a flexible package of compensation for affected turf cutters. Those affected who want to cease cutting turf completely can apply for compensation of €1,500 per annum for the next 15 years. Eligible cutters are also entitled to a one-off payment of €500 for this year. This means the total compensation package is worth €23,000, index linked and tax-free.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">For those who wish to continue cutting, my Department is working to relocate turf cutters to alternative bogs. Turf has now been cut on the first of these relocation bogs and others are being prepared or are being identified in consultation with affected cutters. Where relocation bogs are not yet available, turf-cutters can choose between a €1,500 payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of turf, each year while the relocation bog is being identified, acquired and prepared for cutting. They will also be entitled to the one-off €500 payment. To date, more than 2,100 applications for compensation have been received by my Department with payments issued to some 550 applicants already. The first deliveries of turf have also been made in recent days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">My Department is maintaining ongoing contact with the European Commission both in terms of the development of the national plan and in regard to updating the Commission on the unauthorised cutting to date and the steps being pursued on enforcement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">The whole area of development of the Irish audiovisual industry (including the gaming sector and other digital content) was examined during the preparation of the Creative Capital Report — Building Ireland's Audiovisual Creative Economy.  The Report was published in July 2011 and an implementation Committee to pursue the execution of its recommendations has been established.  One of the recommendations in the Report is the extension of Section 481 until the end of 2020. It is currently approved until the end of 2015.  A public consultation process to assist the Department of Finance in examining the operation of the Section 481 Scheme beyond 2015 was announced on 24 May 2012. This consultation process invites interested parties to make submissions on the economic impact assessment of the operation, status and future development of the Section 481 Scheme.  My Department is involved in this consultation process.</p>

This pilot initiative, established with funding of €230,000 for 2012, is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources. The scheme aims to promote support for the arts from private sources and to unlock multiples of the funding put up by the taxpayer.  The Philanthropy Leverage Initiative will provide an incentive to arts and culture organisations to seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. The initiative will be available across projects of varying scale, geography and art form. Full details are available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 446, 456 and 482 to 484, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">As Deputies will be aware, we are already arrived on the Centenary anniversary of the tumultuous decade that saw the transition from the campaign for Home Rule to the establishment of an autonomous Irish State. It was a period when the parliamentary process was overtaken by the resort to arms in Ireland and the descent of Europe into war. It was also a period of transformation and cultural renewal in Irish society, following on electoral reform, land reform, education reform and migration. The demand for constitutional change was in parallel with the assertion of workers' rights and women's rights. The decade from 1912 to 1922 is the most momentous of modern Irish history and requires a comprehensive commemorative programme that will acknowledge the achievements of the revolutionary generation and enhance the understanding today of the events that shaped our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">While it is intended that the official commemorative programme will continue through the entire Decade of Centenaries until 2022, consideration is currently being focused on an initial programme to 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">With a strong commitment to the development of a comprehensive and balanced programme of commemorations, I very much appreciate the support of the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group.  The meetings of this Group, of which I am Chairman, not only provide opportunities for suggestions and advice from members in relation to the programme, but also allow interested institutions and groups to make presentations in relation to their expectations in the coming years.  At the most recent meeting on 22 May, the Group discussed commemorative planning with a cross-community group from Belfast and met with members and officials from Dublin City Council in relation to future co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">In order to ensure a coherent presentation of the history of the period, the commemorative arrangements will be aligned, as far as possible, with the historic timeline of the Centenary anniversaries.  I very much appreciate that the commemorative programme will have the support of a panel of distinguished historians, chaired by Dr Maurice Manning, providing advice for the Government and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on both the overall commemorative programme and on any specific issues which may arise. I very much hope that the commemorative programme will strengthen the public interest in our national history and encourage original research at local and national level. I understand that the expert group will be consulting widely — with universities, educational and cultural bodies, local historical associations and committees, and individuals — on the advancement of historical study.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">To date in 2012, there have been a number of significant centenary commemoration events. In late March, the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, visited Iveagh House in Dublin, at the invitation of the Tánaiste, to offer his reflections on Carson's influence and on Irish Unionism. The centenary of the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill in the Westminster Parliament on 11 April was marked by memorial lectures on the work of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party, hosted by Waterford City Council.  In mid-April, I addressed a conference in Belfast about the Ulster Covenant, organised by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">With support from my Department, Dublin City Gallery — The Hugh Lane is currently hosting a major exhibition —<i>Home Rule and Modern Ireland</i>. The centenary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant will be marked on 28 September of this year, although the details of any event have not yet been confirmed. The county libraries of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan will host exhibitions on the Covenant this year, with support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Other events planned this year include the completion of the restoration of Erskine Childers’ yacht, <i>Asgard</i>, and the continuation of the National Library of Ireland’s <i>Europeana</i>   World War I collection roadshows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">The developing programme of special Centenary commemorations will complement the established arrangements for annual commemorations, which includes the National Day of Commemoration and the commemorations at the GPO and Arbour Hill.  The annual commemoration of the Great Famine and other events outside the Centenary framework will also continue. In this regard, consideration is being given to special commemorative arrangements for events such as the millennial anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">With our priority attention to the immediate future, the arrangements for commemoration in 2016 are still at an early stage of consideration.  The significance of particular buildings and sites in relation to the Rising will be borne in mind in developing the commemorative programme.  Similarly, the special arrangements for military ceremonies or parades on the Centenary of the Rising in 2016 have yet to be addressed. I would renew my invitation to Deputies and all interested persons to send me any contributions or suggestions they would offer towards the developing programme.  If Deputies have any particular interests or concerns in this regard, I would be grateful to hear from them.</p>

This year's National Famine Commemoration took place on Sunday, 13th May in Drogheda, County Louth.  Details of the work of the National Famine Commemoration Committees since 2008 in implementing a varied and diverse annual programme of events to coincide with the National Famine Commemoration are available on the relevant pages of my Department's website at<i>http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/NationalFamineCommemoration2012/</i>.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1377">In relation to the display of famine memorabilia in exhibitions, the Deputy will appreciate that decisions in relation to any such displays would be operational matters for the relevant cultural institutions or other entities concerned. I should, however, draw the attention of the Deputy to my reply to Question No 293 of 7 February 2012, in which I pointed out that the National Famine Commemoration Committee had previously considered the possibilities around exhibiting a collection dedicated to the Irish Famine in the National Museum of Ireland. The Committee was given to understand that much of the evidence relating to the Great Famine is statistical and pictorial, and, as there are very limited artefacts that could be exhibited at the National Museum, the position is that there is insufficient material to support a dedicated exhibition at that venue. The Deputy will, of course, be aware that there are many local museums and other entities around the country that display material relating to the Famine period, the Irish National Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, Co Roscommon, being an excellent example.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">Ireland's rich heritage has a key role to play in national economic recovery.  My Department is currently promoting the role which Ireland's heritage has to play in making our country an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, both in terms of the operation of Ireland's national parks and nature reserves, and in terms of our unique built heritage, which distinguishes us and which makes Ireland an attractive tourist location for both visitors and Irish people themselves. Cultural and heritage tourism is one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product, and heritage properties, including those in State care, are an important element of that attraction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">My Department provides some limited funding under a number of headings for investment in the built and natural heritage, and also supports the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust in their work in the heritage area. However, the scope to provide additional funding for the protection, conservation and development of the State's built heritage is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances. My Department is therefore focusing on working creatively across Government and with partner bodies such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, Fáilte Ireland, the LEADER Programme and other heritage interests in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector. My Department will also continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The recently published Heritage Council research document<b><i>Economic Value of Ireland’s Historic Environment  </i></b>provides comprehensive evidence-based data that support and enhance our innate understanding of the importance of our built heritage.  I welcome publication of the report, which is a useful tool that complements the work of my Department and the findings of which will help to inform the development of the Government’s heritage policy and related initiatives. The report indicates that capital investment in built heritage conservation provides significant employment in the construction industry and is of major benefit to the national economy. Such investment also assists in developing and maintaining specialised skills among conservation professionals and craftspeople.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">In the context of the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015, my Department is developing various policy actions which contribute to the protection and appropriate re-use of our built heritage and aim to deal with on-going challenges facing our architectural heritage, such as the adaptive re-use for historic properties and a forward plan-led approach to cultural heritage and urban design in our towns and cities. This will also assist in the maintaining of specialist jobs in the wider heritage sector and in particular the repair and maintenance industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1393">Ethiopia is one of the nine Programme Countries for the Government's aid programme, where we have a commitment to the provision of long term strategic assistance.  One of the key aims of our development cooperation programme in Ethiopia is to support the increased use of basic social services such as health and education by its citizens.  While the Government of Ethiopia has made substantial progress in deploying basic services across the country, there is still a relatively low uptake of such services by the poorest and most marginalised communities, especially women.  Ireland supports efforts to address this by improving the capacity of service providers and the quality of the basic services, as well as tackling the barriers poor people face when accessing these services. These efforts are advanced through a multi-donor programme with the title Protection of Basic Services.  Ireland has supported this Programme since 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">The social accountability component of the Protection of Basic Services programme aims to enable Ethiopian citizens to express their needs and preferences for improved and effective services delivery and to hold policy-makers and service providers accountable for weak performance.  Engagement in social accountability by citizens, local government officials and service providers is intended to improve service delivery by making public services more effective, efficient, responsive and accountable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">The pilot phase of this component commenced in January 2008 and concluded in July 2009.  Irish Aid supported this first phase, and its preparation, with funding of €720,000. At the end of the pilot phase, the World Bank, acting on behalf of Ireland and other donors, commissioned an independent evaluation of the pilot.  This evaluation confirmed that social accountability facilitated improved, constructive dialogue between citizens and local government officials in the pilot areas. It also concluded that there was an increased citizen awareness of their rights, responsibilities and entitlements to basic services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">In light of this positive evaluation, and following a rigorous process of design and procurement, led by the World Bank, the second phase began in late 2011 and will run for two years.  Irish Aid has so far provided €1.8 million in funding for this second phase.  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa is engaged in the management and oversight of the programme, as an active member of the steering committee chaired by the Government of Ethiopia and of the donor technical advisory group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">All programmes assisted by international donors in Ethiopia are regularly submitted to independent external evaluation, as was the case with the pilot phase of the social accountability programme.  The Protection of Basic Services programme has also been reviewed recently by an international firm commissioned by the European Union Delegation. The Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department has commissioned an external independent evaluation of the Irish Aid Country programme in Ethiopia for the period 2008-2012. This will provide an evidence-based assessment of the performance of the programme as a whole and of its contribution to partner programmes we have funded, including the Protection of Basic Services programme. This evaluation will be completed in the coming months and the full evaluation report will be made available to the public through the Irish Aid website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">More generally, Irish Aid has in place a range of rigorous checks and safeguards to ensure that Ireland's development assistance is achieving the intended development results and benefiting those who are most in need.  These include regular audits, independent evaluations, independently-commissioned surveys and frequent field monitoring visits.</p>

As neither of them is an Irish citizen it is not possible for my Department to offer them consular assistance. The Greek authorities are under no legal obligation to assist our Embassy with any requests made in connection with this investigation, as we have no<i>locus standi </i>in the matter. However, on hearing of Mr. Marku’s predicament, and notwithstanding the fact that he is not a citizen of Ireland, the Irish Embassy in Athens made contact with the Greek police in an effort to convey the Irish Government’s interest in this case on the basis that he is married to an Irish citizen. It was made clear to our Embassy that the authorities in Crete would not provide them with any information regarding this investigation owing to the fact that no Irish citizen was involved in the case.  </p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1403">Relationships with Iran continue to be dominated by grave concerns over its nuclear programme, reflected in successive UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolutions adopted since 2006 and notably in the IAEA's report of 24 February 2012 which highlighted possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">The international community has consistently urged the Iranian Government to respect and fulfil its international obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to engage seriously and unconditionally  in discussions aimed at confirming the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">Ireland has strongly supported this position.  As a State Party to the NPT, Iran must fulfil its commitments and obligations under the Treaty.  These include the obligation under Article II "not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices" and the obligation under Article III to conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Ireland continues to support strongly the dual-track approach which EU High Representative Ashton is pursuing on behalf of the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK, US, Russia and China).  This combines a willingness to negotiate with Iran a determination to apply sanctions if these are required in order to ensure that it responds seriously to the concerns of the international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">Given the overall lack of progress in persuading Iran to respond to the international concerns (which have been deepened by the most recent IAEA reports), the EU and other international partners such as the US and Canada found it necessary earlier this year to impose further rounds of restrictive measures against Iran.   In the case of the EU, these included an embargo on Iranian crude oil imports to the EU which is due to come into effect on 1 July.   While imposition of these further measures has not been easy, not least in terms of the impact on global oil prices which affects us all, I nonetheless believe that these additional sanctions have been necessary and effective in persuading Iran to return to the negotiating table and to accept an invitation from High Representative Ashton to resume discussions with the E3 + 3.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">Following an initial constructive round of discussions in Istanbul on 1 April, the E3+3 and Iran held a further round of talks in Baghdad on 17/18 May.  While no agreement has yet been reached and substantial difficulties remain, HR Ashton has reported from the Baghdad talks that there is some common ground between the parties.  The talks indicated an apparent readiness on Iran's part to proceed on the basis of reciprocity and to contemplate confidence-building measures (CBMs), including in relation to the crucial enrichment issue.  However, more work needs to be done in elaborating any possible package of CBMs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">A further round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Moscow on 18 June, at which time it is hoped that Iran will come forward with a specific and constructive response to the proposals outlined by the E3 + 3 at the Baghdad meeting.  Such positive engagement on Iran's part will be necessary in order to prevent a further ratcheting-up of sanctions, already due to be tightened with the full entry into force on 1 July of the EU oil embargo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">The Government remains strongly of the view that the issues surrounding Iran's nuclear activities can only be adequately addressed and resolved through diplomacy and negotiations, and not by any other means.  We will continue to advocate this position in all international fora, including at EU and UN level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1412">Longstanding and close bilateral ties have characterised relations between Ireland and Argentina since diplomatic relations were formally established between the two countries in 1948, the same year that Ireland opened a resident mission in Buenos Aires. Argentina opened its resident mission in Dublin in 1964.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">Consultations between senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and their Argentine counterparts also take place on a regular basis to discuss and develop co-operation in the political, economic and cultural spheres. Consultations took place most recently in Argentina in May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">In 2011, Argentina was Ireland's 44th largest trading partner. Total merchandise trade stood at €227,777,000, a 37.8% increase over 2010. There are a number of Irish companies with significant investments in Argentina, and there exists further niche opportunities in the country for Irish companies. Ireland's embassy in Buenos Aires is working with the state agencies and Irish companies in efforts to access these opportunities. The embassy is working to establish an Irish business network as part of this work, which will support exploration of export opportunities and enhance opportunities for networking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">Further to this, a working holiday agreement exists between Ireland and Argentina whereby 100 young citizens of both countries can travel to and work in the other country for up to one year. It is hoped to increase the number of places available under this programme to 200 per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">The embassy in Buenos Aires has a varied cultural programme targeting the 500,000 Argentines with Irish ancestry as well as the wider Argentine public. St. Patrick's Day celebrations have been increased in recent years with celebratory events in all of Argentina's main cities. There are also efforts ongoing to hold an Irish Cultural Week in 2013, hopefully to coincide with St. Patrick's Day celebrations next March.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">This funding is used to support the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services in my Department, the maintenance of state-owned properties abroad and the provision of vehicles for official use at missions abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">ICT-related capital expenditure covers the purchase of office machinery and equipment, including IT and telecommunications hardware and software to support the Department offices, at HQ and abroad, including the Passport Service.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1439">The Passports Act, 2008 provides, among other things, that only Irish citizens are entitled to be issued with Irish passports.  Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person's entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.   The Passport Service must operate within the law on this as in all matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">The Department received an application from the person in question last April. This application accompanied applications from her mother and an older sibling in respect of whom passports have since been issued.  Her mother was entitled to citizenship on the basis that she became a naturalised Irish citizen on 1 April, 2012.  In terms of the older sibling, she was born in the State in 2002.  Under the terms of Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act), this child was automatically an Irish citizen by virtue of her birth in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">It should be noted, at this stage, that the child's father also became a naturalised Irish citizen on 1 April, 2012 and has been issued with an Irish passport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">The position for the person in question is different, however.  She was born in Dublin on 8 February, 2008.  The Act was amended in 2004 to provide that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person's birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that his/her birth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">As neither parent was an Irish citizen in 2008, their residence in the four year period from 8 February, 2004 to 7 February, 2008, which immediately preceded their daughter's date of birth, had to be examined by the Department to determine her entitlement to Irish citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">In line with guidelines provided by Department of Justice and Equality, which is the Department responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered by this Department for passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports and/or the registration cards/books. These are issued to persons registering their lawful presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). In addition, the Department will accept letters from GNIB that state the various permission details which have been issued to a person.  All of these are official documents/permits, which can be objectively verified by the Department, if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">GNIB have provided information to the Department that shows the parents have been registered in the State since 16 June, 2005.  The amount of residence from this date to 7 February, 2008 is less than three years.  As the statutory requirement has not been met, their daughter's entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated.  Accordingly, her application for a passport has been refused under the Passports Act, 2008 on the grounds that she is not an Irish citizen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">There was contact between the Department and the parents during the processing of their daughter's application.  On 11 May last, the Department wrote to the parents to inform them of the decision to refuse their daughter a passport and to explain the background for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">It remains open to the parents to pursue the matter of their daughter's entitlement to become a naturalised Irish citizen with the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the event that she does acquire Irish citizenship by this or any other means, the Passport Service will be in a position to issue a passport on receipt of a new application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1449">The Government remains seriously concerned about the situation in Sudan and South Sudan.  We are working with our EU partners to ensure that, in addition to a focus on the political and security situation, priority is given by the international community to the vital issue of humanitarian access to people and communities affected by the conflict and the tension in the region.  We will continue to use all available opportunities, within the EU and internationally, to raise these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The situation in Sudan and South Sudan, including the humanitarian crisis in Southern Kordofan, has been discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at their meetings over recent weeks and months.  In January, with Ireland's encouragement, the EU urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians, and reiterated its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance. The EU also emphasised that the ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to progress in providing the full range of support that we would like to provide to Sudan, and in the region.  In April, the EU called on the Government of Sudan and the SPLM North to engage in an inclusive political process to resolve the ongoing conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">The UN Security Council on 2 May and 17 May adopted Resolutions demanding that both Sudan and South Sudan fulfil their obligations under international law to allow access by humanitarian agencies to civilian populations in need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has provided substantial assistance for those affected by the conflict in this region.  Earlier this year, we allocated €2 million for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Funds for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan.  On 24 May, we announced an allocation of a further €3m in funding.  These funds are being provided to help UN agencies and NGOs target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas affected by conflict and by displacement of populations from the Blue Nile and South Kordofan areas.  We have made available a further €1.22 million to Irish NGOs for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual Irish Aid Humanitarian Programme Planning funding scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">Ireland's emergency humanitarian assistance to Sudan and South Sudan is saving lives daily.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in South Kordofan, the Blue Nile, and other areas facing critical need across the Horn and Sahel regions of Africa.  Along with our EU partners, we will continue to press for unrestricted humanitarian access to affected civilians.</p>

            <p eId="para_1457">Human rights are a cornerstone of Ireland's foreign policy.  With our European Union partners, we monitor closely the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world.  We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including the United Nations, the EU and other international organisations, as well as civil society organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's concerns about indications of continuing human rights abuses in Colombia, where trade unionists, human rights activists and people who were displaced from their lands over the course of the civil conflict are among the vulnerable groups. The efforts of President Santos' administration since August 2010 to improve the situation should, however, be acknowledged.  These efforts include the passage of the landmark Victims' Rights and Land Restitution legislation (2011) and a conference on human rights which is scheduled to take place at the end of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">The Deputy will also be aware of the EU's policy of engagement and dialogue with the Government of Colombia.  Ireland actively supports this policy.  We believe it offers the best way to further the objectives of supporting democracy and improving the human rights situation there.   We will continue to monitor the situation and to support the Colombian Government's efforts, both in partnership with the EU and in our bilateral contacts with Colombia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">Ireland is active on human rights issues in Sri Lanka, both at EU level and in the UN Human Rights Council.   We were to the fore in the EU decision to suspend GSP+ status for Sri Lankan exports in 2010.  We have conveyed our concerns directly to officials at the Sri Lankan Embassy in London and again at the UN in Geneva on 22 March 2012.  We support engagement with Sri Lanka to address these issues.  It is important, however, that the Sri Lankan Government demonstrates a genuine commitment to the protection of human rights in Sri Lanka, to reconciliation among the country's communities and to a political solution to the divisions on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">The particular difficulties faced by the Kurdish population in a number of countries vary from one to the other.  We continue to avail, both bilaterally and at EU level, of all appropriate opportunities to engage with the countries concerned on the general human rights situation in each, including specific issues concerning the Kurds and other minorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">There are minority Kurdish populations in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria, each of which has expressed grievances centred on issues of identity.  In Iran, Iraq and Turkey, the situation has at various times been greatly complicated by the existence of armed groups seeking an independent Kurdish state.   This has led to armed conflict and has exacerbated human rights difficulties.  The general human rights situation in Syria and Iran, in particular, is profoundly disturbing; the protection of minority rights in these countries gives rise to particular concern.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1464">As I have repeatedly stated in the past, the human rights situation in Iran is profoundly disturbing.  The period since the Presidential election of 2009 has been characterised by an intensification of human rights violations on many fronts.  Of particular concern are the high level of executions, including executions after trials which failed the most basic standards of natural justice, including the absence of any right of appeal or rights of defence.  Equally, capital sentences are imposed for a number of offences which, according to international standards, should not result in such punishment.  I am also concerned about the continuing imposition of the death penalty against minors, in violation of Iran's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the practice of secret executions in Iran which has been highlighted by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Ireland has spoken out consistently against such abuses.  At EU level, we fully supported High Representative Ashton's statement of 30 May, following an earlier statement last January, in which she expressed her deep concern about the alarming increase in the number of reported executions in Iran, in sharp contrast to the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty.  The High Representative also called on Iran to commute all death sentences for offences not considered to be among the most serious crimes by international standards.  Ireland has also supported the High Representative's call on Iran to halt the execution of Sakineh Ashtiani and Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani and all pending executions and to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">Given the gravity of these abuses as well as the unwillingness of the Iranian Government to redress these entrenched practices, the EU felt compelled in April 2011 to adopt wide-ranging sanctions against those responsible for committing grave human rights violations, including a stringent travel ban and asset freeze.  Last October the latter was extended to include additional individuals.  These strong measures send an important political signal to all those in the Iranian judicial system and elsewhere who perpetrate human rights abuses.  It leaves them in no doubt about Ireland's and the EU's resolve to ensure that fundamental freedoms and human rights are fully respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">Ireland also continues to be active at UN level in highlighting the serious human rights situation in Iran.  This includes our co-sponsorship both of a General Assembly resolution, adopted last October, which expressed the international community's deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran and of a Resolution, adopted by the UN Human Rights Council on 22 March, which welcomed the report and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and expressed serious concern at the developments noted in that report. At a bilateral level, my Department also engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy and regularly conveys our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran, including the unacceptable use of the death penalty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">In relation to the particular case mentioned, I understand that Mr. Fariborz Firoozi is a young Iranian activist who fled Iran in fear of imprisonment and persecution.  Mr. Firoozi is currently being held in detention by the Swiss authorities.  He is in the process of being transferred to Hungary under the terms of EU Regulation 2003/343<b> (</b>otherwise known as the Dublin II agreement) which established the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">Switzerland became party to this Regulation in June 2005.  It determines the EU member State responsible for examining an application by any asylum-seeker seeking international protection under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to refugee status.  As Hungary in this case is deemed responsible for considering Mr. Firoozi's application under the terms and criteria of the Geneva Convention, it is not in Ireland's jurisdiction and competence to assess the merit of his application for refugee status.  We have no reason either to believe that Mr. Firoozi's basic entitlements will not be adequately sustained in the relevant procedure to be initiated in Hungary under Regulation 2003/343.  It is worth recalling that this foresees a review mechanism should Mr. Firoozi wish to appeal an eventual negative decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1474">The Presidency staffing plan for the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the EU in Brussels has been prepared following a co-ordinated and careful evaluation of the needs of all Government Departments and Offices.  While the details are not fully finalised, the staffing of the Permanent Representation is expected to temporarily increase by some 80 officers in the lead-up to and for the duration of the forthcoming Irish EU Presidency from January to June, 2013.  This number comprises 8 staff assigned from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and 37 from other Departments and Offices, as well as a small number of secondments from other sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">Separate processes are also under way in Brussels for the temporary local recruitment of approximately 20 interns and 10 clerical staff, of which the greater portion has been sought and will be funded by other Departments and Offices.  These posts are open to eligible citizens of the EU and of the other European Economic Area member states — Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.  In excess of 540 applications were received for the intern posts from which, following a competitive interview process involving 60 short-listed candidates, a panel of the 30 candidates deemed the most highly qualified and suitable for appointment was established.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">While candidates placed on the panel are now being offered temporary assignments, a breakdown on the basis of nationality will not be available until all appointees are in place.  The focus of the recruitment process has been to select candidates with extensive EU knowledge and expertise.  Nevertheless, I understand that a large proportion of the candidates qualified for appointment are Irish.  In the case of temporary clerical staff, the focus will be on administrative experience and language skills.  The closing date for receipt of applications for those posts is 15 June.  The contracts of all locally employed staff will terminate at the end of the Presidency in June 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_1479">Ireland together with our EU partners believes that constructive dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is the best way to address differences and tensions in Tibet and to reach a solution that respects Tibetan culture, language, religion and identity.  It is important for the long-term peace and stability of the region that the two sides come to an agreement on the future of Tibet.  To this end, we continue to encourage an early resumption of dialogue by the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">The promotion of human rights is an important dimension of European foreign policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union. Constructive dialogue remains the EU's preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in China.

            <p eId="para_1703">Increasing the carbon tax by €5 to €20 in Budget 2012 meant a relatively small increase spread across all mineral oils and natural gas rather than larger increases in the excise rates on specific fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The amount of €20 charged per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted through the combustion of mineral oils is set down in the Finance Act 2012, and this carbon charge is an integral part of the rates of Mineral Oil Tax applied to those fuels. A move to link the carbon charge directly to the market price of carbon credits could, therefore, involve frequent adjustments to Mineral Oil Tax rates, and give rise to uncertainty for fuel suppliers and customers. It would also give rise to an additional administrative burden both for taxpayers and for the Revenue Commissioners. Accordingly there are no proposals for altering the present arrangement under which the carbon charge is determined periodically through the Budget process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1737">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that landlords may deduct interest on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair commercial property from the gross rent when computing their rental profits for tax purposes on that property. Interest incurred before the first occupation of the property by a tenant for the purposes of a trade or undertaking, or between lettings, is not deductible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">I am also informed by the Commissioners that the information provided for interest relief for rental property is based on claims for such relief on all rental properties included in personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers declaring interest on borrowings to be offset against rental income assessable under Case V, Schedule D. It is not possible to separately identify how much of this cost is associated with commercial property.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for 2010, the latest year available, the amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against all rental income assessable under Case V, Schedule D for both residential and commercial property is estimated at €660 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">This estimate is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could, therefore, be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide data for 2011 as the tax returns for that year are not yet due. The figures for 2010 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply.</p>

It was fully consolidated into INBS and all securities issued by that company were held by INBS. Therefore at no time were any securities sold to external investors. The structure was unwound at no gain or loss to IBRC in April 2012 as the particular securities no longer met ECB criteria and therefore the bank was  no longer able to access low cost ECB funding.</p>

In this context I have indicated that there is no private sector involvement for senior bank paper or Irish Sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners.  This commitment has been agreed without external partners and is now the basis on which Ireland's future financing strategy is built.  This strategy is working well as evidenced by the reduction in pricing of Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary markets and the recent successful bond exchange offer by the NTMA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1760">As already indicated it is not possible to identify bond holders with any degree of certainty. Such securities are freely tradable once issued and therefore the issuer (i.e. the Bank) has no means of establishing the underlying ownership.  These securities are publicly traded and dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house.  At maturity, the Bank will instruct its paying agent to transfer the funds due to the clearing house who will then distribute the funds to the holders of the securities as per their records.</p>

While the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT law provide for the possibility of applying a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of certain medical equipment this possibility does not extend to the supply or hire of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines typically used in the treatment of sleep apnoea.  Nor is there any provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply an exemption or the zero VAT rate to the supply or hire of such products.  The supply or hire of CPAP machines is therefore liable to the standard 23% VAT rate.  The supply of parts and accessories is also liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p>

         asked the

         his views on whether the cash accounting scheme as it exists in Ireland, with a condition that businesses have an annual turnover of no more than €1 million to qualify, is too restrictive; and if he will consider the extension of the scheme to businesses with a turnover of less than €2.5 million, as recommended by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.

            <p eId="para_2010">I would point out that VAT is normally accounted for on the basis of invoices issued, i.e. VAT is payable on the total sales invoiced in the relevant period, regardless of whether or not the trader has been paid for the supply in that period.  However, the cash basis of accounting provides traders with the option to account for VAT on a cash receipts basis.  This means that the trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is actually received.  Availing of this option assists firms in the critical area of cash flow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">In order to avail of the cash receipts basis of accounting for VAT, a business must either a) be supplying goods or services, where 90% of the supplies are to persons who aren't registered for VAT, or b) have an annual turnover which is less than €1 million.  The annual turnover threshold for eligibility for the cash basis of accounting is €1 million and has been effective since 1 March 2007.  Although it is possible under EU VAT law to increase the threshold, the cash basis can only be used for "certain transactions or certain categories of taxable persons".  It cannot be used to replace the normal VAT arrangements across the board.  In addition, increasing the cash basis threshold from €1 million to €2.5 million would be very costly to the Exchequer, costing in excess of €150 million in the year of introduction.</p>

            <p eId="para_2074">The illegal smuggling of cigarettes and other tobacco products and the illicit selling of these products is a problem for many tax jurisdictions throughout the world.  Ireland has a longstanding policy, primarily because of health concerns and also for budgetary reasons, of high tobacco taxation, and this makes this State a particularly attractive market for tobacco smugglers.  Easy access to Ireland via cheap flights from countries with significantly lower tobacco taxes accentuates the attractiveness of Ireland for criminals involved in the illegal importation and sale of tobacco.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products.  They attach a high priority to this area, and they continuously review their response to the problem and their effectiveness in tackling the illicit tobacco trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">The operational strategy employed by Revenue to tackle the illicit tobacco trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises in order to disrupt the internal distribution network for illicit tobacco.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">In 2010, Revenue established a high-level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans.  This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue's website<i>www.revenue.ie</i>, includes a series of programmes which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">Revenue's strategic-level plans include ensuring that the legitimate trade remains compliant; delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of resources; further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at organisational, national and international level; a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.</p>

            <p eId="para_2080">I understand your question is intended to ascertain when the loans drawn down from the EU/IMF Programme will be repaid.  I would first of all emphasise that the funds drawn down under both the EU/IMF programme and the bilateral loan agreements are not ring-fenced for particular uses and contribute alongside tax and other State revenues to meeting all calls on the Exchequer.  However, the cost of bank recapitalisation to date has been met from our existing resources — cash reserves and the NPRF.  Under Ireland's EU-IMF Programme, which is due to expire at the end of 2013, a total of €67.5 billion in loans will be provided from EU facilities, bilateral loans and the IMF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">At the end of April 2012, Ireland's nominal borrowings under the EU/IMF Programme amount to €48.97 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The weighted average life of the loans drawn down to date is 9.8 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">The estimated all-in fixed euro equivalent cost of loans received under the EU/IMF assistance programme is 3.46%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">When the programme was initially agreed the average maturity of all loans was set at 7½ years. Following the Euro Area Heads of State or Government meeting in July 2011, it was agreed that average maturities for the EU facilities, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), should be extended.  For the EFSF, maturities will now be a minimum of 15 and up to 30 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The repayment of the loans from the IMF commences in 2015, and that for the EU loans we have received from the EFSM and the EFSF also commences in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">In the case of the bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark, repayment is due 7½ years after each drawdown.</p>

            <p eId="para_2090">Before 1 August 2008, profits or gains from stallion fees were exempt from income tax and corporation tax, although all other profits from horse-breeding, such as the sale of yearlings, were always taxable.  The exemption no longer applies to profits or gains arising on or after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">Since 1 August 2008, stallions are treated as stock in trade which means that income from stud fees and profits or gains on the sale of the stallions are fully taxable in the hands of both corporate and individual owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">A write-off over 4 years of the cost of a stallion is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes in computing income from stallion fees and profits or gains on the sale of stallions.  This 4-year write-off period reflects the fact that some stallions have a short nomination life and also takes into account that the majority of stallions are unsuccessful at stud.  The impact of the deduction on taxable profits during the write-off period is directly related to the success, or otherwise, of the stallion.  Without this provision the cost of a stallion would, under normal rules, be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death.</p>

            <p eId="para_2096">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that specific measures have been implemented to tackle hidden economy issues in the cash sector including casual trading markets.  The threat to the Exchequer posed by the shadow economy is fully recognised by Revenue which puts a strong focus and concentration on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity.  Revenue's overall approach to the shadow economy in all sectors, including the weekend trading markets, is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and over 500 joint Revenue/DSP inspections took place in 2011, and over 200 so far in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">In tandem with this Joint Agency activity, Revenue have run specific projects to detect shadow economy activities and recover VAT, Income Tax and PAYE where due, together with appropriate statutory interest and penalties.  These projects include streetscape operations and visits to market, fairs and high profile festivals and events.  In 2011, 36 weekend markets were visited and, so far, in 2012 Revenue has carried out 39 streetscape operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">In combating tobacco smuggling and retail of illicit cigarettes, I understand that Revenue's ongoing activity in this area is complimented by a number of blitz visits to casual trader markets. These types of activities normally take place in off-hours, the majority of which is weekend activity.  In 2011, there were 6 national tobacco blitzes and weekend visits were paid to the main risk markets, resulting in 26 seizures amounting to 58,900 cigarettes and 8.68 kilos of tobacco.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">In 2011, Revenue committed additional resources to tackling tax evasion in high-risk sectors and carried out over 11,000 audits of businesses and individuals as well as over 546,000 other compliance checks.  These resulted in additional yield for the Exchequer of nearly €483m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that any person can inform them of instances of tax evasion through the network of local offices, by phone, email or letter. There is a confidential free-phone number 1800 295 295, for reporting tobacco smuggling or sale of illicit tobacco products. Reports of suspected evasion/fraud should provide as much detail as possible particularly in terms of location, names, addresses, telephone numbers and vehicle registrations.  All such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they are committed to tackling tax evasion and avoidance across all areas of the economy. Their goal is to prevent a loss of revenue to the State and at the same time to ensure that a level playing field exists for the benefit of legitimate trade interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing programmes that are dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2143">The tax exemptions for the travel pass scheme operates on two levels in order to ensure that the taxation benefits are given to employees.  Firstly, where a travel pass is provided in addition to normal remuneration the taxable BIK that arises on its provision is exempt from tax in the hands of the employee under section 118(5A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">However, many travel pass schemes operate under what are known as salary sacrifice arrangements.  These are arrangements under which an employee agrees with his or her employer to take a cut in remuneration and in return the employer incurs the cost of providing a benefit of a corresponding amount to the employee (that is, a bus, rail or ferry pass).</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">As a general rule, Revenue does not regard salary sacrifice arrangements as reducing an employee's taxable income.  If an employee foregoes salary payable under an existing contract of employment in exchange for a benefit, the employee remains taxable on the "gross" income payable.  An exception to this rule is made in the case of the travel pass scheme.  Under section 118B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 where an employee is provided with a travel pass, the employee will not be chargeable to tax on the remuneration sacrificed.  The corresponding cost to the employer of the travel pass does not, as stated above, give rise to a BIK tax charge on the employee who receives the travel pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the couple concerned are jointly assessed the tax relief is, in fact, provided at the couple's marginal rate of tax (i.e. either 20% or 41% depending on the rate of tax applicable to the couple).  If the couple is not currently being jointly assessed to tax they should contact their local tax office with a view to ensuring that joint assessment applies to them if this is what they want.</p>

            <p eId="para_2149">At an aggregate level, my view is that over the medium term wages should move in line with productivity trends.  In fact, one of the key problems in the past decade was that wage growth was far in excess of productivity gains.  This undermined Ireland's competitive position and resulted in a sharp moderation in export growth from 2000 onwards.  Encouragingly, however, some of this competitiveness loss has been reversed and this is standing to us in terms of export growth and larger inflows of FDI.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">At a disaggregate level, there must be a degree of wage differentiation in the economy to reflect the heterogeneous nature of employment and the specific demand and supply factors for certain jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2153">The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Deputy will be aware that the Interdepartmental Report on Mortgage Arrears indicated that the reform of personal insolvency legislation is a central catalyst to the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem.  In particular, it indicated that new non-judicial debt settlement arrangements are vital to address the problem.  The Government is in the process of finalising a Personal Insolvency Bill with a view to publishing it at the end of June.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has indicated a strong intention to commence Second stage prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">The Interdepartmental Report also recommended that a Mortgage Advice Service should be provided to advise people in their dealings with mortgage lenders.  The Minister for Social Protection is now finalising the appropriate framework for the provision of this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">Both of these measures will require the utilisation of independent and professional expertise to best assist people in difficulty with their mortgages or other debts.  In finalising these matters and putting in place the necessary structures, the key objective will be to provide the best possible service in the most efficient manner and this general approach does not preclude the non-profit sector or other sectors from appropriate involvement in those proposed important services.</p>

            <p eId="para_2160">The Eurogroup concluded its review of the ESM capacity on 30 March and agreed in principle the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">That the ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes as from July 2012. The EFSF will, as a rule, only remain active in financing programmes that have started before that date.  For a transitional period until mid-2013, it may engage in new programmes in order to ensure a full fresh lending capacity of €500 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">The current overall ceiling for ESM/EFSF lending, as defined in the ESM Treaty, will be raised to €700 billion such that the ESM and the EFSF will be able to operate, if needed, as described above.  As of mid-2013, the maximum lending volume of ESM will be €500 billion.  The combined lending ceiling of the ESM and the EFSF will continue to be set at €700 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">In addition, €49 billion out of the EFSM and €53 billion out of the bilateral Greek loan facility have already been paid out to support current programme countries. All together the euro area is mobilising an overall firewall of approximately €800 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2178">The introduction of the USC, replacing the Income and Health Levies, reduced the top marginal tax rates for both PAYE and self-employed income earners by 4%.  In the case of PAYE this allowed for the abolition of the PRSI ceiling and the restoration of the PAYE marginal rate to 52%.  However, in the case of the self-employed, where there is no PRSI ceiling, the marginal rate remained reduced.  This had the unintended effect of benefiting high earning self-employed income earners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">Therefore, as a transitional measure, a new rate of USC of 10% was introduced in Finance Act 2011 for income in excess of €100,000 arising from self-employment.  This restored the self-employed marginal tax rate back to 55% where it was in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2187">The Government announced the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) in September 2011.  The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy.  As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, that the NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects.  Marketing of this fund in Ireland by Irish Life Investment Managers and abroad by AMP Capital commenced in the first quarter of 2012.  Normally the period from commencement of marketing of an investment fund targeting illiquid assets to closure of financial commitments by investors in such a fund can extend up to one year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2194">The Government is conscious of the difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage commitments.  In accordance with the conclusions of the Inter-Departmental Report on Mortgage Arrears, the key focus of attention is on the development of measures to assist people who are having genuine difficulty in meeting their mortgage payments as opposed to providing assistance for people currently experiencing negative equity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">The Deputy will be aware of the range of measures currently being advanced to address this mortgage arrears problem.  The Central Bank is engaging with all regulated mortgage lenders on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies project.  The objective of this engagement is to ensure that each lender has an effective strategy and plan for dealing with its mortgage customers who are, or who are likely to be, in difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2196">The Deputy will be aware that the Interdepartmental Report on Mortgage Arrears indicated that the reform of personal insolvency legislation is a central catalyst to the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem.  In particular, it indicated that new non-judicial debt settlement arrangements are vital to address the problem.  The personal insolvency proposals are not intended to address the issue of negative equity but to resolve the issue of insolvent debtors in a fair and effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2197">The Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the timeframe for publication of the Bill is now the end of June next and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has indicated a strong intention to commence Second stage prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.</p>
            <p eId="para_2198">A draft general scheme of a Bill was published by the Minister for Justice at the end of January for consultation and a number of submissions were received in response including from some financial institutions.  However, there have also been advances made to allow people currently experiencing negative equity to access new mortgages.  The Deputy may wish to note that in a recent speech given by Mr. Matthew Elderfield, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank said that the Central Bank agreed in late 2010 that two lenders could develop negative equity mortgages on a pilot basis.  In light of the limited take-up of these mortgages the Central Bank decided to adapt its approach to make provision of negative equity mortgages easier. The Central Bank has set out for lenders general criteria under which it will consider allowing the provision of such mortgages.  The Central Bank has not set prescriptive standards in these areas but will look to see that lenders are taking a reasonable and controlled approach.  All such sales however must also comply with the affordability and suitability provisions set out in the Consumer Protection Code.</p>

In addition, Income Tax for 2007 and 2008 and Preliminary Tax for 2011 has not been paid.  The persons concerned have recently been in contact with the Collector General's Office in relation to this matter.  Arising from that contact, they will be aware that until such time as the outstanding tax returns are filed, Revenue is not in a position to quantify the tax outstanding or to decide if the informal phased payment arrangement currently in place is sufficient to clear the arrears within a reasonable timeframe.  Until such time as they can do this, Revenue will not be in a position to consider issuing a tax clearance certificate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2217">I have been informed by the Central Bank that where the proceeds of an endowment policy are insufficient to repay the capital element of an endowment mortgage, borrowers should be given ample time to make alternative repayment arrangements.  In addition, borrowers are afforded the protections of the 'Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears' in cases where the mortgage is in arrears or in pre-arrears and is secured by the borrower's primary residence.  The Deputy may wish to note that, when the risks associated with endowment mortgage products were highlighted in the 1990s, specific provisions were incorporated into the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which require warnings to the effect that the proceeds of a policy may not be sufficient to repay a mortgage.  Under the provisions of the Act, endowment mortgage savings plans must be reviewed by the life company at least every five years to check if the plan is on track to repay the mortgage. In this regard, a statement setting out the estimated revised valuation of the endowment policy at maturity must be issued by the insurer to the borrower.  If the policy is not on track to repay the mortgage, the life company will recommend an increase in the premium.</p>

            <p eId="para_2219">The decision on whether or not to grant individual mortgages remains a commercial decision for each individual lending institution and, as Minister for Finance, I have no function in such decisions.  This is outlined in the Relationship Frameworks with the banks which provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions, including with respect to pricing and lending decisions.  These frameworks are published on my Department's website at<i>http://banking.finance.gov.ie</i>.  Mortgage lending must be undertaken on a commercially sustainable and prudential basis by lending institutions and conform fully with regulatory requirements both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the consumer’s interest.  It is important in that context that each lending institution is allowed to assess independently the individual risks in granting mortgage finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2438">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that no taxpayer has an automatic entitlement to tax back for any specific period.  In the case of PAYE workers, the calculation of any PAYE tax paid that may be due back to a taxpayer is not based on any time period but is based on the amount of taxable income received by a person in the year in question, the amount of tax paid and the amount of tax credits and reliefs due to the person.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">In the case of a PAYE worker who becomes unemployed the calculation of any refund that may be due varies depending on the personal circumstances of each taxpayer and is based on the amount of tax paid up to the date of unemployment, the amount of credits and reliefs utilised up to that date and the amount of other income from all sources that the individual may have for the year in question.  It should be noted that jobseekers benefit in excess of €13 each week is taxable.</p>

            <p eId="para_2444">Like PAYE taxpayers, any refund due to self assessed taxpayers for a tax year is calculated based on the amount of taxable income received by a person in the year in question, the amount of tax paid and the amount of tax credits and reliefs due to the person.  A period of unemployment of a self-assessed person, while factored into the amount of tax payable by them, does not necessarily give rise to a refund of tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_2487">As the deputy is aware, the Forward Planning Section of my Department utilises a Geographical Information System (GIS) to analyse demographic data in order to determine the areas where additional school accommodation may be required.

            <p eId="para_2488">It is anticipated that enrolment in primary and post-primary schools will grow by around 70,000 pupils between now and 2018 — by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary.  It is expected that enrolments will continue to rise at post-primary level to the year 2024 at least.</p>

I also announced new arrangements for the recognition and determination of patronage of these new primary and post-primary schools.  The new arrangements published by my Department provide a balanced approach to allow applications to be made by prospective patrons for the establishment of schools.  The criteria used in deciding patronage of the new schools place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage, which also includes preference for all-Irish school provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2506">This Government has protected education as much as it can.  Far greater reductions in expenditure and in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools.  But there are limits to the level of expenditure on education and the number of teaching posts we can afford.  The Budget 2012 measures in relation to the post-primary sector are set out in the documentation that was published by my Department last December.  This envisages a net overall reduction of about 450 posts at post-primary level between the current school year and the 2012/13 school year.  This net reduction in posts takes account of the impact of the budget measures, demographics and the budget decision to shelter all the DEIS post-primary schools through a reduced staffing schedule of 18.25:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">My Department has published Circular 0009/2012 to inform all post primary school management and staff of the staffing arrangements for post-primary schools for the 2012/13 school year, including in particular, the requirements to manage guidance from within the standard allocation.  The circular is available on the Department website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">I want to re-assure the Deputy that all schools must continue to provide guidance to their pupils.  However, from September 2012 guidance provision must be managed by schools from within their standard staffing allocation.  Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students.  Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2512">The focus in schools is on using ICT (a) as a tool in learning and (b) to improve the quality of teaching and learning across the curriculum, guided by the ICT curriculum framework developed by the NCCA.  This framework is supported by extensive digital resources on the Scoilnet website, by professional development programmes for teachers and by investment in ICT infrastructure.  All post primary schools will be connected to a 100Mbps broadband service by the end of 2014, providing for improved integration of ICT in learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">One of the Statements of Learning in the Junior Cycle reform is to ensure that all students "Use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life".  The forthcoming Junior Cycle reform will allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration.  This will provide opportunities for schools to progress the provision of courses to enhance students' ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">There is also a Transition Year option in relation to "Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games" and, under the ICT Action Plan which I launched earlier this year, this is being expanded nationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_2517">Business and IT interests place a greater emphasis on improved uptake and performance in mathematics and the sciences in general at the post-primary level than on provision of a specialist courses in computer science.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">In an extract from the Report "Key Data on Learning and Innovation through ICT at School in Europe 2011" by Eurydice (European Commission).  It notes that, on page 40:  "The ‘Handbook on Digital Strategies for Educational Transformation' recommends embedding the use of ICT and digital media across the whole curriculum through specific tasks in all subjects in order to develop digital fluency (European Commission/ICT Cluster 2010, p.29).  Empirical research has highlighted that there is indeed a shift from teaching ICT skills in isolation towards more horizontal approaches, ‘crossing the traditional boundaries of academic subjects' and forming part of other complex skills such as collaboration and communication. (Voogt and Pelgrum 2005, p. 172)</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">Eurydice information on curricula and steering documents show that education policy reflects these findings.  ICT is used as a general tool and/or for specific tasks across the different subjects of the curriculum in the large majority of countries."</p>

            <p eId="para_2571">As a result of Budget 2012, Circular 70/2011 provides that teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date. Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011. The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance which had been applicable to an honours primary degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">Pending the outcome of the review of allowances, they are not payable to new beneficiaries from 1 February 2012. The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, for a limited period of time, the assistant principal allowance. These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2574">These measures are concerned with the sustainability of the public service pay bill and in particular the need to find payroll savings in the education vote. Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services. I am not in a position to comment further until the outcome of the review is known.</p>

            <p eId="para_2598">The Deputy will be aware from my previous response to him in December 2011 that this project was at an advanced stage of the tender process but progress had been delayed due to a number of technical issues relating to site access. These issues have now been resolved. However following the withdrawal of both the preferred bidder and the second lowest tenderer, my Department in consultation with the Design Team and school authorities, agreed to re-tender the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2599">Subject to no further issues arising, it is envisaged that the project will be re-tendered shortly and will then progress to construction in late 2012 or early 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_2601">Financial assistance is available to students under the student grant scheme, which from the 2012/2013 academic year will be administered by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI — a division of the City of Dublin VEC) on behalf of my Department.  SUSI will accept all new applications in its first year of operation. Renewal applications will continue to be dealt with by the existing 66 grant awarding authorities.  Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">A person in receipt of a social welfare payment as a lone parent may be entitled to a student maintenance grant provided they meet the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme.   The means-tested one parent family payment is not included in calculating reckonable income where paid to the applicant.  In addition, the one parent family payment is an eligible payment for the special rate of maintenance grant.  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the assessing authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">In the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses, from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme. Existing postgraduate students will not be affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">Those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.  In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. There will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2605">Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees. Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2609">I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 213 and 229 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2610">The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill contains provisions to protect the existing remuneration and superannuation entitlements of staff transferring to the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland. It is appropriate that the Oireachtas would protect remuneration and pension entitlements and these are covered in sections 21 and 22 of the Bill respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2611">In relation to any small variations in other terms, conditions and work practices that may exist between staff in the three organisations, it is not my intention to seek to undermine the working conditions of staff transferring to the new Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2612">However, in order for the new body to operate efficiently and effectively, it is important to achieve as much coherence as possible in working arrangements and terms and conditions. I believe that this can be achieved most effectively through management and staff associations working together, and within the framework of the Croke Park Agreement, to agree common approaches on any issues that arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2613">The relevant provisions in the Bill mirror those in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 that covered the transfer of FÁS and HSE staff to the Department of Social Protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_3478">Several administrative improvements have been introduced to the student grant schemes in recent years to speed up processing. These include the introduction of a single unified grant scheme in 2011 to make it easier to apply for a grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3479">As the Deputy will be aware, from the 2012/13 year onwards, grants will be centrally administered by a single grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI — a division of the City of Dublin VEC), which will administer the Student Grant Scheme on behalf of my Department. A new online-only grant applications system is being introduced for the academic year 2012/13.</p>
            <p eId="para_3480">The student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year will be published on<i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> in the coming weeks and students are urged to apply as early as possible for a grant. They don’t have to wait for a CAO offer.  Applicants should make sure that their online application forms are properly completed and that they subsequently submit the correct supporting documentation. Late applications and incorrectly completed applications contribute significantly to delays in getting decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3481">My Department will also continue to work with the CAO, the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and USI to make sure that students apply early for grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3482">In addition, the following steps have been taken to ensure that the system runs smoothly in its first year of operation:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3483">1. SUSI will only accept new applications in its first year of operation. Renewal applications will continue to be dealt with by the existing 66 grant awarding authorities.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3484">2. The online applications system is currently undergoing rigorous stress testing to ensure that the application process will run smoothly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3485">The combination of improvements introduced and control measures in place for the 2012/13 academic year should eliminate much of the delays which some students have experienced in recent years and provide sufficient capacity to handle the large volume of applications.</p>

Moreover, the projected growth in demand for higher education over the next two decades creates further challenges for funding. Careful planning and consideration of available evidence will allow us to develop policy options so that the system can meet those challenges in the difficult years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_3502">At my request the Higher Education Authority (HEA) completed an initial study late last year on sustainability of the current funding system for higher education. The HEA report outlines the scale of recent reductions in funding and growth in student numbers, and provides some evidence on the possible impacts of this on quality of provision. However, the HEA has emphasised that the report is preliminary only and that substantial additional work now needs to be undertaken before comprehensive proposals as to how we can sustainably fund higher education into the future can be developed. The HEA is continuing its work in this area and further advice is expected later this year.</p>

This review focused on performance outcomes in line with the FÁS training strategy, in terms of employment, progression to further training and education, and certification.   Such reviews are essential to ensure that FÁS Baldoyle Training Services Unit delivers a diverse range of effective training interventions to a broad category of clients, across a wide range of geographical locations, including Balbriggan, within a defined training budget.  The 2011 review identified the need for FÁS Baldoyle Training Unit to readjust its 2012 training provision and course type in the Balbriggan area as, in many cases, the key performance training outcomes were not being achieved.  Following a recent analysis of labour market opportunities, it has been decided to locate a Contact Centre Support course in the Balbriggan area. This course is scheduled to commence on 11th June, 2012.</p>

From the commencement of the 2012/13 school year, the use of the Catchment Boundary Area (CB) System as a means of determining eligibility for school transport will cease.  This means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for pupils will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre having regard to ethos and language.</p>

The current pupil charge for post primary transport is €350 per annum subject to a family maximum of €650. Eligible pupils who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from these charges.

As the Deputy may be aware, from the 2012/13 year onwards, grants will be centrally administered by a single grant awarding authority Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI — a division of the City of Dublin VEC) which will administer the Student Grant Scheme on behalf of my Department.  A new online-only grant applications system is being introduced for the academic year 2012/13.  SUSI will accept new applications only in its first year of operation. Renewal applications will continue to be dealt with by the existing 66 grant awarding authorities.  The online applications system is currently undergoing rigorous stress testing to ensure that the application process will run smoothly.  I am confident that the establishment of a single grant awarding authority will greatly improve the efficiency of the process and will eliminate the delays which some students have experienced in recent years.</p>

Eligibility for post primary school transport is determined from where children reside and not from where they attend primary school. Bus Éireann is responsible for processing and assessing school transport application forms. In this regard the parents of the children referred to in the details supplied should liaise with their local Bus Éireann office regarding school transport eligibility under the terms of the scheme.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport to a particular school on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the scheme.

Pupils resident on off-shore islands that do not have a school providing suitable free second-level education may also qualify for assistance under the scheme. The maximum grant payable under this scheme may not exceed €4947 per pupil per annum.  Given the scale of our economic crisis, I have no scope to provide additional funding to increase the grants available under this scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3590">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  In considering applications for SNA support, the NCSE takes into account the individual care needs of all qualifying children, supports freed up due to any school leavers, and the identified care needs of newly enrolled children with special educational needs. SNAs, once allocated to schools are a school based resource. The allocation of SNAs, while allocated on the basis of an assessed need of an individual child, are allocated to the school and should be deployed with discretion by the school in a manner which bests meets the support and care requirements of the children. There is no maximum number of hours for which SNA support can be provided for any particular child during the school day.</p>

            <p eId="para_3592">Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed, inter alia, to promote positive mental health. SPHE is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and a curriculum support service which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory. The Department has also issued guidelines to schools on the development of whole-school policies in the areas such as anti-bullying, RSE, substance use, managing critical incidents, whole-school guidance planning etc which are also important in promoting positive mental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_3593">Pastoral care supports are promoted in schools through year heads, key tutor systems, home/school links, etc. This is one of the areas which is evaluated as part of a Whole School Evaluation. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_3594">The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operating within the Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support the personal, social and educational development of students in primary and post primary schools. NEPS also provides assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. NEPS promotes the development of structures and supports among teachers and schools' care teams which assist and encourage the development of contact and collaboration with the relevant local HSE mental health agencies including the Community Psychology Services and Mental Health Promotion Officers and the referral services of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAHMS).</p>
            <p eId="para_3595">This Government has protected education as much as it can. Far greater reductions in expenditure and in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools. But there are limits to the level of expenditure on education and the number of teaching posts we can afford.  My Department has published Circular 0009/2012 to inform all post primary school management and staff of the staffing arrangements for post-primary schools for the 2012/13 school year, including in particular, the requirements to manage guidance from within the standard allocation. The circular is available on the Department website.</p>

            <p eId="para_3597">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by  quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices  and the Inspectorate.  Second-level schools were selected by reference to centrally-held data from the  Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. The  identification process was in line with international best practice and had  regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources  available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">In relation to schools that did not qualify for DEIS, it is important to note  that an independent review process was available to schools that did not  qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of  disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the  programme. The results of the review were notified to schools in August 2006 and additional schools were added to the programme as a result of making successful review applications.  As already advised, none of the existing schools in the country, which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes, were ever admitted to the DEIS programme.  Given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure there is no capacity at present for inclusion of new schools in the DEIS programme.</p>

It is a matter for the Teaching Council to determine the individual's suitability in this regard. Enquiries in relation to Teaching Council registration should be made directly to the Teaching Council by telephone on LoCall 1890 224224 or +353 (0)1 651 7909 or by email to<i>primaryregistration@teachingcouncil.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3605">Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, which is not yet commenced, will require everyone in publicly funded teaching posts to be registered with the Teaching Council in order to be paid from the Exchequer.  The only exception to this will be in very limited, short-term circumstances where a registered teacher is not available.  The recent enactment of the Education (Amendment) Act 2012 will facilitate section 30 becoming law.   My Department and the Teaching Council have issued information to teachers and schools informing them of the forthcoming legal requirements.  Further consideration can be given by my officials to the case referred to by the Deputy once the qualifications of the teacher in question have been assessed by the Teaching Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_3662">I wish to clarify that there have been no cuts made to the allocation for July Provision within my Department's budget.  Therefore, any decision by an individual school to reduce the level of July Provision offered is a matter for each school. Any such decision has not been brought about by reductions in the level of available resources by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">The Deputy will be aware that participation in the scheme is an option for all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism or severe to profound general learning disability that choose to extend their education services through the month of July.  Home based tuition of 10 hours per week for the four weeks is provided to children who attend schools that choose not to participate in the scheme.  Schools can decide to participate for part of the month of July and accordingly the children in question are allocated home based tuition for the remaining period.  My Department's preference is that the home based tuition is undertaken by a fully qualified teacher. However where parents have difficulties in sourcing fully qualified teachers my Department accepts some tutors with alternative qualifications and modifies the rate of payment accordingly.</p>

The project for the school referred to by the Deputy, although not included in the 5 year construction programme, will continue to progress through the design stages of architectural planning within the context of available funding. However, due to competing demands on my Departments capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project to tender and construction stage.</p>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.

The most recent statistics are for the 2010/11 school year. The national average class size is 23.9 pupils. However, with over 20,600 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p>

Currently more than 70,000 teachers are registered and 7,500 teachers apply for registration each year.

            <p eId="para_3681">This Government has protected education as much as it can. Far greater reductions in expenditure and in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools. But there are limits to the level of expenditure on education and the number of teaching posts we can afford. The Budget 2012 measures in relation to the post-primary sector are set out in the documentation that was published by my Department last December. This envisages a net overall reduction of about 450 posts at post-primary level between the current school year and the 2012/13 school year. This net reduction in posts takes account of the impact of the budget measures, demographics and the budget decision to shelter all the DEIS post-primary schools through a reduced staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3682">My Department has published Circular 0009/2012 to inform all post primary school management and staff of the staffing arrangements for post-primary schools for the 2012/13 school year, including in particular, the requirements to manage guidance from within the standard allocation. The circular is available on the Department website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3683">Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3684">The final staffing position for all schools at post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3685">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support which now includes a requirement for them to have regard to the overall cap on numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">In considering applications for SNA support for the new school year, the NCSE will take into account the individual care needs of all qualifying children, supports freed up due to any school leavers, and the identified care needs of newly enrolled children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3688">The NCSE will advise schools of their SNA allocation for the 2012/13 school year shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3698">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3699">The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3700">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3701">Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on<i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3702">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) can also assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>
            <p eId="para_3703">Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_3708">I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 to 228, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3709">Changes to the Primary School Transport Scheme were announced in Budget 2011 and derived from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme. These changes are being applied equitably on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">Firstly, I wish to clarify that a school transport charge for eligible primary children was introduced with effect from September 2011. Children who hold valid medical cards (GM scheme) are exempt from paying a charge. The charge applying in the coming school year is €100 or a family maximum of €220.</p>
            <p eId="para_3711">The Deputy will be aware that from September 2011, the distance criterion of 3.2 kilometres was applied nationally to all children travelling under the primary school transport scheme, including those travelling under the ‘Closed School Rule'.</p>
            <p eId="para_3712">The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of children commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for children entering in September 2012, to those children who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">The number of children who may be affected by this second change, and the savings to be achieved as a consequence of the combination of the changes, will not be known until all applications for school transport have been received and assessed by Bus Éireann. However, sample surveys undertaken by Bus Éireann show that the majority of children are in fact attending their nearest school, so this change will not have any practical impact on the majority of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">Existing eligible children, who are not attending their nearest school, will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there are no changes to their current circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">Siblings of these children, who wish to attend the same school, or other children who are not eligible for transport, may apply for concessionary transport subject to a number of terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">In this regard, it is worth noting that the annual charge for concessionary tickets will be reduced to €100 for the 2012 school year which is the same charge that applies for eligible tickets.</p>

            <p eId="para_3722">The Teaching Council's annual accounts for 2011 show a surplus of c. €11m. Of this amount, €4m has been set aside by the Council to cater for contingencies. Interest on funds in 2011 amounted to €252,000 (2010 — €146,000). This interest forms part of the overall income of the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_3723">The surplus finance will be used to meet the increased costs of the Council as it expands its role. As is often the case when legislation is introduced, it is on a phased basis. Some of the main functions of the Teaching Council have not yet been commenced. For example, in relation to Fitness to Teach; while this function is not yet commenced, there has been a huge amount of preparatory work done in advance so that the Council will be in a position to undertake this work when the relevant legislative provision is made. This function, along with others such as Probation, Induction and Continuous Professional Development will lead to a significant increase in Council expenditure and staffing needs in the future. I hope to be in a position to commence a number of further sections of the Act within the next 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3724">The Deputy will be aware that I have publically indicated my support for a recent decision by the Teaching Council to reduce the cost of its registration fee from €90 to €65.</p>

Renewal of registration involves an application and payment of the renewal fee.  The Council is responsible for the administrative arrangements in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3752">I understand that the Council has in the past provided the option for the payment of the membership subscription through regular deductions from salary.

            <p eId="para_3757">The Teaching Council is the professional standards body for the teaching profession. The Council seeks to set and uphold high professional standards for teaching and teachers. It does this in the interests of pupils and the public good but equally for the reputation and status of the profession. Quality of teaching has been determined as the single most influential factor towards achieving good educational outcomes for students. The work of the Council is focused towards the maintenance and improvement of the standards of teaching and includes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3758">Developing and implementing a ‘Continuum of Education' which links the professional education and training needs throughout all phases of a teachers career.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3759">Restructuring and extending the programmes of initial teacher education in order that newly qualified teachers are better equipped for the needs of the modern day classroom.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3761">Putting in place higher qualification and teacher education standards for teachers in the three sectors — Primary, Post-Primary and Further Education.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3762">Putting in place strict good character and Garda vetting requirements.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3763">Publishing a Code of Professional Conduct for teachers (which is currently being revised).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3764">Putting in place induction procedures for newly qualified teachers and a probation process applicable to all newly registered teachers.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3765">Preparing for Fitness to Teach procedures and processes when the Council's powers in this area are commenced by the Minister.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3766">Developing a Continued Professional Development framework for teachers. The individual teacher benefits from being a member of a fully regulated profession.  The work of the Council supports teachers in the following key areas:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3767">Protecting standards of entry to the profession, promoting induction processes and fostering best practice in continuing professional development.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3768">Reviewing and accrediting programmes of teacher education.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3769">Promoting research and engaging in debate and discussion on policy issues related to education.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3770">Dealing with complaints as to alleged professional misconduct made against teachers (when Part 5 of the 2001 Act is commenced).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3771">Advising Government on teaching supply and other professional issues.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3772">Enhancing the teacher's individual status and identity by his or her being part of a recognised, collective professional entity, with statutory authority and recognition.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3773">Enhancing the status of the profession and use every opportunity to promote teaching as a career.</p>
            <p eId="para_3774">Through all of the above the Teaching Council will help teachers to set and maintain the standards for the profession.  It is the policy of my Department that all teachers paid from State funds should be registered by the Teaching Council and suitably qualified. The Education (Amendment) Act 2012 which was recently signed by the President paves the way for the commencement of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act which is part of the progression towards a fully regulated profession.</p>

            <p eId="para_3777">The Teaching Council Act includes provisions governing membership, funding, accountability and the council's relationship with the Department. The legislation provides for the appointment of a 37 member council.

The council is required to provide the Minister with information and advice on matters relating to its functions having regard to resource implications and other relevant matters. In certain circumstances, members of the council may be removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3780">Aside from the formal provisions, there is ongoing contact and communication between my Department and the Teaching Council at official level.

Responsibility for addressing any funding difficulties rests with the trustees of the schemes, the members of the schemes and the companies themselves.

            <p eId="para_3800">As I informed the Deputy in a previous reply, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Valuation Act, 2001 and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative. The statute does not accord me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform any function in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3801">In accordance with the Act, a revaluation programme which began in November 2005 in the greater Dublin area is ongoing, the current emphasis being in the Dublin City Council area which commenced in May, 2011 involving the valuation of approximately 25,000 properties and which is expected to be completed in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_3802">As part of the roll-out of the revaluation programme to other local authority areas, the Commissioner signed the valuation orders for Waterford City, Waterford County and Dungarvan Town Council areas on 12th December, 2011 and Limerick City and County on 29th March, 2012. The Waterford and Limerick revaluations will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively. It is intended to extend the revaluation programme to further local authority areas as soon as it is practicable to do so but it is not possible at present to say where these areas will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_3803">The Commissioner had indicated that, with the intention of speeding up the revaluation work, two pilot schemes were to be undertaken on outsourcing some of the work and exploring the introduction of a self-assessment scheme.  The enabling provisions to allow for the start-up of these schemes were included in legislative proposals approved by Government on 6th December, 2011 and as a consequence, planning for their initiation is currently underway in the Valuation Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3804">Significant work has already been done on the formulation of amending legislation to streamline and improve the valuation system and the Heads of a Bill, having been approved by Government, are now with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting of the Bill with a view towards its publication as part of the Government's legislative programme at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_3826">I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts. These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3827">supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of €25,000 or more to be advertised on the<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3828">less use of "restrictive" tendering procedures and greater use of "open" tendering;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3829">ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3830">sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_3831">Circular 10/10 has been in place for almost two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small and Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3836">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator's private member's Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill is now at Second Stage in the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3837">During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, Minister Hayes signalled to the House his intention to bring proposals to Government on Committee Stage amendments dealing with the following issues:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3838">Thresholds:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3839">In order to ensure that the legislation applies to the majority of Construction Contracts the scope of the legislation will be broadened by reducing or removing the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3840">Adjudication:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3841">This issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is a complex issue.  It is important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3842">Supplies:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3843">Proposals are being developed to broaden the scope of the legislation to include bespoke construction supply contracts. However, as I understand it, this is likely to be difficult to define in a manner that is easy to interpret.</p>
            <p eId="para_3844">When these and a number of other technical issues have been examined, Minister Hayes will bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.</p>

            <p eId="para_3870">Since 2009, Central Government Departments have been improving their respective payment times, so as to assist the cash flow of businesses, and are obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This 15 day prompt payment rule was introduced by Government on an administrative basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3871">Departments are required to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target. To date, 11 sets of Quarterly returns have been published on my Department's website<i>www.djei.ie</i> . The returns for the first Quarter of 2012 were published on the 3rd   of May.  These Returns show that in value terms 88% of invoices were paid within 15 days for that quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3872">The ongoing publication of these composite returns by my Department provides clarity in relation to the performance of individual Departments in meeting the terms of the Government Decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3873">As part of the commitments in the EU/IMF Programme for Ireland, the 15 day prompt payment rule was extended beyond central Government Departments and rolled out to the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (excluding Commercial Semi-State bodies), in respect of valid invoices received, on or after, 1 July 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3874">As part of this new extended arrangement, parent Departments are required to publish on their respective websites Quarterly composite reports covering those bodies under their aegis. The individual bodies covered by this arrangement are also required to publish their own Quarterly reports on their websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_3875">These new reporting arrangements should ensure that all Ministers will be able to monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and will enable them to address any issues with those bodies who are not meeting these obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3876">Any Small Businesses experiencing difficulties in securing payments should, in the first instance, approach the Government Department or State body concerned.  Any failures to comply with the initiative can also be brought to the attention of the relevant Minister with responsibility for the body concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3877">Under   Key Actions Points Nos. 3.44 and 7.13.2 of the Action Plan for Jobs, and to support compliance with the new 15 day Prompt Payment requirement for all public sector bodies and agencies (excluding commercial Semi-State bodies), the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation published the Prompt Payment Official Notice on its website on the 20 March 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3878">Small Businesses can attach this Official Notice of the new payment requirements to relevant invoices.

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_3880">It is important to maintain an appropriate balance in terms of labour market flexibility and protection of employees and this is something that is constantly under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3881">The most recent evidence supporting the view that Ireland is among the least rigid labour markets is available from the OECD's most recent report on the subject of employment protection and the extent of its rigidity across OECD member states.  Entitled "Legislation, Collective Bargaining and enforcement: Updating the OECD employment protection indicators (<i>http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/9/43116624.pdf</i>), the report ranks Ireland among those member states with the least stringent employment protection systems.  On a scale of 0-6, where 0 was the least stringent and 6 the most stringent system, Ireland scored 1.39 overall.   This indicator was made up of three sub-indicators:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3882">1. Protection of permanent workers against (individual) dismissal.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3883">2. Specific requirements for collective dismissal.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3884">3. Regulation on temporary forms of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3885">There have been no changes to Irish legislation governing either of the first two sub-indicators (unfair dismissal or collective redundancies) in the period since the OECD report was published in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3886">In respect of the third OECD sub-indicator (legislation governing temporary employment), the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act, enacted last month, transposes an EU Directive to provide equal treatment between agency workers and directly recruited workers in terms of basic pay and employment conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3887">Even allowing for this legislative change since 2008, I am not convinced that Ireland's rigidity score would be significantly impacted relative to other OECD members, many of whom, as EU Members, were also obliged to transpose the Directive on Temporary Agency Work.</p>
            <p eId="para_3888">The OECD's analysis that Ireland is not excessively rigid in the application of employment protections is further supported by the report of the World Competitiveness Rankings for 2012 (<i>http://www.imd.org/research/publications/wcy/upload/scoreboard.pdf</i>), released last week by the Swiss Business School, IMD.  This report ranked Ireland as Number One globally for the flexibility and adaptability of its workforce.  In my view, this is recognition that Ireland is maintaining an appropriate balance between flexibility and protection in our labour market regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3889">I am aware that some EU member states, particularly Scandanavian countries, have pursued a "flexicurity" model, whereby greater flexibilities are available for employers in the termination of staff contracts. However, such a system is only viable where there are complementary balancing measures. Typically a feature of such models is significantly enhanced social protection measures, including generous and sustained income supports, an option that is not feasible in an Irish context in the current economic climate.</p>

            <p eId="para_3900">The Programme for Government details a commitment to establish a Microfinance Loan Fund targeted at start-up, newly established or growing micro-enterprises across all industry.  The Action Plan for Jobs reconfirms this commitment.  It is generally accepted that lack of credit severely restricts opportunities to create and support micro enterprises and in so doing help reduce unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3901">When viewed in a macroeconomic context, microfinance is a very cost effective job creation/protection mechanism generating a high rate of return. In many cases the business promoters and any other staff hired come from the unemployed ranks and are therefore drawing State benefits. Existing employees who choose the entrepreneurial route and set up their own business are also likely to create a residual employment opportunity in their previous organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3902">The Microfinance Fund is designed to stimulate lending to sustainable microenterprises and is targeted at start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises across all industry sectors, employing not more than 10 people.  It will provide loans of up to €25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks.  This is part of the Government response to the unmet demand in Ireland for micro-finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3903">The Government has approved the allocation of €10 million as seed capital for the Fund. It is anticipated that the Fund will supplement this seed capital by leveraging further funding from private sources, including the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3904">The €10m allocation, supplemented by €15m bank borrowing in tranches of €5m over years 2,3 and 4, will generate €40m in loan expenditure and create 3,800 jobs over a 5 year period. This is based on €8.8m of loan demand and 20% Bad Debts and will greatly assist employment in the microenterprise sector.  Finalisation of the required legislation to establish the Fund is on-going and subject to completion of all administrative and corporate governance requirements, it is anticipated that the Loan Fund will become operational in Quarter 3 of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3905">Furthermore, I would bring the Deputies attention to self-employment supports from the Department of Social Welfare.  People who are getting social welfare payments can keep all or part of their payment for a time after becoming self-employed if they take part in one of the Enterprise Allowance schemes.  There are two schemes: the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance Scheme and the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3906">Approval normally involves an interview to assess the viability of the proposed project and to provide advice on funding, start your own business courses or other relevant aspects of self-employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3908">The position in relation to legal advice or representation for complainants will not be changed in any way on foot of the reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) will, among other matters, incorporate the proactive information functions, currently discharged by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), in relation to informing employers and employees in respect of employment rights and responsibilities with a particular emphasis on complying with employment law and avoiding and resolving disputes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">As is currently the case the provision of such information will not extend to the merits or otherwise of individual complaints or cases.  It would not be appropriate for a body which also has an adjudicative role to provide advice to individual complainants.</p>

            <p eId="para_3912">The position in relation to representation at hearings of the WRC and Labour Court will be in line with existing arrangements and provisions insofar as the Rights Commissioners, Equality Tribunal, Employment Appeals Tribunal and Labour Court are concerned in that parties will be free to represent themselves or be represented by a person of their choosing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3913">My aim is to ensure that hearings are conducted in a fair and balanced manner to the highest standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_3920">Figures in respect of the number of jobs created in firms assisted by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are published each year in the Annual Report for those agencies and are available on the websites<i>www.idaireland.ie</i> and <i>www.enterprise-ireland.com</i> respectively.  In 2011, 11,594 jobs were created in IDA Ireland assisted companies and 9,038 were created in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3921">In 2012, the projection for new jobs to be created in IDA Ireland assisted companies is 12,500 and the projection for new jobs to be created in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies is 10,300.  These projections are broadly similar to those made for 2012 at this time last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3922">The Government's Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020. I recently announced the progress which has been made in this regard so far this year. Meanwhile, I am already getting suggestions and proposals in relation to preparing the Action Plan for 2013, which I am examining and will bring to Government later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3924">It would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific contracts in the procurement process.   Any issues or queries concerning the award of a particular contract should be addressed by the company in question to the procuring authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3925">Public procurement policy is primarily a matter for the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Mr. Brian Hayes, T.D.</p>
            <p eId="para_3926">Public procurement policy is aimed at ensuring that all public sector purchasing is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent, and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used.  As a Member State of the EU, we are also obliged to observe the principles of the free movement of goods and services within the Single Market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3927">Under EU Directives, contracting authorities are obliged to advertise contracts valued above certain thresholds in the Official Journal of the European Union. The threshold for supplies and general services is currently €125,000.  In addition, national guidelines in Ireland stipulate that all contracts for supplies and general services with an estimated value of €25,000 and upwards are to be advertised on the national tenders website,<i>www.etenders.ie</i>.  It is open to any interested party to submit a tender for consideration in response to advertisements at EU or national level.</p>

            <p eId="para_3930">The Government has no plans at present to lift employment permits restrictions for non-EU nationals nor does it see that the current policy impedes inward investment. Visas are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_3931">It is current Government policy to issue new employment permits in respect of jobs requiring key skills and where there is a recognised scarcity of suitably skilled workers. The issue of any employment permit is predicated on a job offer from a prospective Irish employer who has made every effort to recruit an Irish or EEA national for the post. In considering applications the Department takes cognisance of applications submitted with the support of the IDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3932">For specified highly skilled and strategically important occupations, where a skills shortage exists, Green Card employment permits may be issued. The Green Card permit is issued to the employee and allows his or her employment in the State by the named employer in the occupation specified on the permit. It may be issued for a period of two years. The employee may apply for immediate family re-unification and an application for long-term residence may be made after two years. No labour market needs test (e.g. newspaper and FÁS/EURES advertising) is required prior to making an application. Sensibly, it is a requirement that no more than 50% of staff employed by a company in Ireland may be employment permits holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3933">The Department also operates an Intra-Company Transfer (ICT) scheme. This scheme is designed to facilitate the transfer of senior management, key personnel or trainees who are foreign nationals from an overseas branch of a multinational corporation to its Irish branch. Only 5% of the workforce may have ICT Permits. However for startups this may be waived on a case by case basis for an initial period. No labour market needs test is required in respect of an application for an Intra-Company Transfer permit. Certain criteria apply in the case of ICTs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3934">Application forms and information in relation to the criteria that apply in the case of all employment permit types including green cards and ICTs are available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_3936">I welcome the successful outcome of discussions at the International Labour Conference (ILC) in June 2011 that led to the adoption of a new International labour standard aimed at ensuring Decent Work for Domestic Workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3937">The final text of the draft Convention was one that the Irish Government was in a position to support and the Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers has become ILO Convention No. 189, supplemented by a Recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3938">The question of ratification by Ireland of this — or indeed any — international Convention must be considered from the perspective of any amendments that may be required to existing domestic legislation, as well as the cost implications for both the State and private enterprise, if any, arising from ratification, including enforcement arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3939">My Department is in the process of assessing the implications of the Convention from these perspectives, including any amendments that may be necessary to existing employment rights legislation which numbers in excess of thirty Statutes, together with associated Regulations and Statutory Instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3940">The date to which the Deputy refers derives from Article 19 of the ILO Constitution  which provides that Member States "<i>should bring the Convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action”.</i>    It is not yet clear that legislation will be required in this case and therefore the question as to whether there will be a legislative role for the Houses of the Oireachtas is not certain.</p>
            <p eId="para_3941">Nevertheless, I intend to communicate in the near future with the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation in order to apprise the Committee of the content of the Convention and to provide an update on the process to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3942">However, it is important to note that, in the meantime, domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3943">A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People's Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990. The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people's homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3944">It is also worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving domestic workers, as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from domestic workers.</p>

Capital funding of €10 million has also been allocated for expenditure by my Department in 2012 in respect of the Micro Finance Loan Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_3947">The funding provided to the agencies is used to operate programmes that provide a range of grants, supports and financial facilities to clients.

         the number of Industrial Development Agency sponsored site visits to locations in Drogheda, County Louth, including the IDA Business Park, Drogheda, County Meath in 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_3979">I am informed by IDA Ireland that statistics in relation to site visits by potential investors are maintained on a county by county basis only.  In the three year period 2009 to 2011 inclusive, there have been a total of 83 IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Louth.  The number of such visits paid in each of those years is set out in the attached tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3980">The global economy and, in particular, the European economy, which is the primary target market for foreign direct investment (FDI) clients in Ireland, is in a low growth phase.  The challenge for IDA is to win FDI in this low growth environment.  In addition, there is the intense and continual international competition to win this FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million people i.e. London, Manchester, Boston, Los Angeles etc.  Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3981">In order to achieve balanced regional development IDA focuses on marketing Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass.  IDA also highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In addition, IDA will promote other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements and enquiries on an opportunistic basis.  With the improved infrastructure now in place, a significant number of people commute within the North East Region, of which Dundalk is the Gateway, and IDA considers a project win in one town in the region to have a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3982">IDA has 21 client companies in County Louth employing in the region of 1,500 people. So far this year there have been two job announcements for County Louth with the potential to create a further 1,200 jobs over the coming 3/4 years which will almost double the numbers employed in IDA client companies.  In April, Diaceutics, an international business consulting and software application firm specialising in personalised medicine, announced the creation of 20 new jobs over 3 years in Dundalk, while in February, PayPal, the leading global online payments company, announced the creation of 1,000 jobs over the next four years at its new European Operations Centre also in Dundalk.  This new Centre will open in July 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3983">This achievement by IDA in securing these investments has to be recognised as an enormous boost for the economy of the Region as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_3993">The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature with the terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined in the main by a process of voluntary negotiation and agreement without the direct intervention of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3994">In general, Irish law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, but rather is designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences.  The State takes a supportive role, by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than an interventionist one.  Institutions such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3995">The experience and expertise of the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute. It is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3996">Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding.  Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_3998">The Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) 2012 Act transposed EU Directive 2008/104/EC on Temporary Agency Work into Irish law. The Act provides for equal treatment in terms of basic working and employment conditions for agency workers, as defined in the Act, as if they were employees recruited directly by the Hirer to do the same or similar job. The Act covers</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3999">(a) Basic pay.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4000">(b) Working time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4009">The provisions in relation to "pay" for agency workers on assignment on 5 December 2011 have retrospective effect to 5 December, 2011 (the date of transposition of the Directive).  In respect of agency workers that commenced assignment after 5 December 2011 but before the Act came into effect, the provisions in the legislation relating to "pay" have effect from the date of assignment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4010">The Act provides a derogation from the principle of equal treatment in relation to ‘pay' in respect of agency workers who hold a permanent contract of employment with an employment agency.  For this derogation to apply:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4011">The agency worker must be notified of the implications of the derogation in writing in advance of signing their contract of employment.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4012">The contract of employment must include a statement to that effect.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4013">The agency worker must be paid between assignments at a rate of no less than half of the pay they were entitled to in respect of their most recent assignment (not less than the National Minimum Wage).</p>
            <p eId="para_4014">In relation to all other entitlements, the legislation is effective from the date of enactment of the Act.   "Pay"   is defined in the Act as basic pay, and any pay in excess of basic pay in respect of, shift work, piece work, overtime, unsocial hours worked or hours worked on a Sunday but does not include sick pay, payments under any pension scheme or arrangement, occupational social security schemes or financial participation schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4015">The Act does not prescribe the rate of pay other than to require that the rate of pay for the agency worker should be the same as that which applies to a direct employee of the hirer recruited to the same or a similar job.  This must have regard for established pay scales, collective agreements, terms and conditions of employment etc. that apply in enactments, collective agreements or any arrangements that apply generally in respect of employees or to a class of employees.  The Act specifically allows for the application of arrangements whereby agency workers are entitled to conditions that are better than the basic working and employment conditions provided in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_4016">The hirer is obliged to provide relevant information to allow the Agency to comply with the legislation.  Should proceedings in relation to a contravention of the Act be brought by the employee against the agency and the contravention is attributable to the failure by the hirer to provide information as prescribed then the hirer shall indemnify the employment agency in respect of any loss incurred by agency that is attributable to such failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4017">Complaints in respect of contraventions of the Act may be presented to the Rights Commissioners within 6 months of the date of the contravention and up to 18 months where reasonable cause for not presenting the case is shown.</p>

         the steps he will take to ensure that there will never be a repeat of the treatment that the workers in the Vita Cortex plant in Cork had to endure for nearly six months and that no workers in Ireland should ever be put through this situation again; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4038">I welcome the fact that a mutually acceptable resolution was found to bring an end to the long running dispute at the Vita Cortex factory. I am conscious of the toll that the events have taken on the workers and their families since 16 December 2011 when 32 workers began the sit-in at the factory arising from a dispute with their former employer over extra-statutory redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4039">The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature with the terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined in the main by a process of voluntary negotiation and agreement without the direct intervention of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">In general, Irish law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, but rather is designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences.  The State takes a supportive role, by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than an interventionist one.  Institutions such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4041">The experience and expertise of the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute. It is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.</p>
            <p eId="para_4042">Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process. The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavor, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.</p>
            <p eId="para_4043">Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties involved, which was the case in the Vita Cortex dispute.</p>

            <p eId="para_4049">The provision of property and infrastructural solutions is a key element of IDA Ireland's offerings to potential investors to the regions.  The strategy of developing and maintaining lands and property solutions in advance of securing new mobile investments has been a fundamental differentiator in IDA's marketing efforts with overseas clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_4050">I am informed by IDA that its Roscommon Business and Technology Park, which is located on Racecourse Road, extends to approximately 13 Ha, of which in the region of 7 Ha remains available for promotion.  The Park is fully Masterplanned and is maintained to a Flagship Standard with on-going landscape maintenance contracts in place.  The Park is available not only to facilitate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and investments made by indigenous industry supported by Enterprise Ireland, but is also potentially available to facilitate other investments and to act as a catalyst for employment generation in the region. Such investments need not necessarily be supported by either IDA or Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4051">There is intense and continual international competition to win FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million i.e. London, Manchester, Boston and Los Angeles.  Ireland has one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area.  In order to achieve regional economic development, IDA focuses on marketing Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  IDA's Midlands Region consists of the counties of Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Laois and Longford. With the improved infrastructure now in place, a significant number of people commute within the Midlands Region and IDA considers a project win in one Midlands town to have a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">IDA also promotes Roscommon town to potential overseas investors through its network of overseas offices and in response to specific client requirements but, in the final analysis, it is the investor who decides in all cases where to locate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">Meanwhile, we must not lose sight of the fact that at present there are 900 people employed in IDA supported companies in County Roscommon.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4058">The figures in respect of jobs in Enterprise Development agency-supported companies and those supported by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are compiled in the Forfás Annual Employment Survey and the CEB Annual Employment Survey respectively on an annualised basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4059">The figures in respect of jobs created in Enterprise Development agency-supported companies and those in companies assisted by the CEBs are set out in Table 1 accompanying this reply.  As there are no figures available in respect of jobs created in CEB-supported companies prior to 2011, details of jobs existing in those companies from 2008 to 2010 inclusive are set out in Table 2.  There is no information available specific to skills requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4060">The jobs created with agency and CEB assistance contribute greatly to the development of local economies throughout the country and, in addition, the agencies and CEBs work closely with their clients both in the early start-up stages of businesses and also to ensure the sustainability of those businesses through on-going support, advice and mentoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_4061">The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) has pointed out that Ireland has become significantly more cost competitive since 2008.  The World Economic Forum rankings showed Ireland's position holding steady last September (where we stayed at 29th out of 134 countries), with the Institute for Management Development (IMD) Work Competitiveness Yearbook released last week showing Ireland's headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th in 2011, out of 59 countries).  The IMD places Ireland in the top 10 in relation to our business efficiency.  This mirrors our 10th   position overall in the World Bank's "Doing Business" listings (out of 183 countries).  Both of these are a good foundation to build on in seeking, as I have regularly outlined in recent months, our Government's ambition to make Ireland the "Best small country in which to do business".  We have jumped ahead of a number of other small countries in the latest results, such as Belgium and New Zealand.   We need to make sure that we tackle those remaining areas where we can best support our enterprises and our people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4062">To make that happen, we need companies, employers, entrepreneurs and innovators who are all viable and thriving, and an enterprise environment that is supportive of their efforts, allowing enterprise and creativity to flourish and quality employment opportunities to be grown and maintained.  Many of the actions which we are pursuing through the "Action Plan for Jobs 2012" are aimed at improving Ireland's overall competitiveness — reducing costs and ensuring that the enterprise environment (regulation, infrastructure, availability of skills) are all supportive of those companies which can sustain and create jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4098">Statistics relating to foreign direct investment ( FDI) are reported on an annual basis  and are published in the IDA's Annual Report. The number of FDI investments won for this country , together with the number of new jobs created in IDA client companies in each of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 is set out on the tabular statement below.</p>
            <p eId="para_4099">When deciding on investment locations, Foreign Direct Investors look at the entire business environment in a country, for example: Competitiveness, Market access, Education and skills, Infrastructure, Political and regulatory environment and tax rates.  On a global scale, Ireland scores extremely well in many of the key areas of importance to investors.  In addition to political stability and a highly attractive corporate tax rate, Ireland has a young, well educated workforce, growing levels of R&amp;D activity, a modern internationally trading enterprise base and a long track record as a successful location for overseas investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4100">2011 saw a strong performance in the level of FDI won by Ireland.  IDA Ireland client companies created over 13,000 new jobs despite the current global economic situation and a strong increase in international competition.  In accordance with the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, IDA Ireland is working to target another 144 new FDI investment projects in 2012, which will create 12,500 new jobs with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250 this year.  Up to the end of May 2012, there have been 44 IDA announcements with in excess of 5,000 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4101">The National Competitiveness Council has pointed out that Ireland has become significantly more cost competitive since 2008.  The World Economic Forum rankings showed Ireland's position holding steady last September (where we stayed at 29th out of 134 countries), with the IMD Work Competitiveness Yearbook released last week showing Ireland's headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th   in 2011, out of 59 countries). We are now ranked:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4102">1st for skilled labour and for flexibility and adaptability.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4103">2nd for lack of protectionism and for foreign investors.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4104">3rd for labour productivity and for exports of commercial services.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4105">4th for real corporate taxes.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4106">5th for inward investment flows.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4107">10th for business efficiency, up 8 places from 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4108">The Taoiseach has set the ambition that by 2016 Ireland will be the best small country in the world in which to do business, and the Government has started to implement our plan to deliver on this. Through the Action Plan for Jobs, we are implementing a raft of changes to reduce costs to business, improve access to finance and encourage greater innovation and in the coming months I will be developing a list of areas in which Ireland's performance is lagging internationally and a plan to address this.</p>
            <p eId="para_4109">Many of the actions which we are pursuing through the "Action Plan for Jobs 2012" are aimed at improving Ireland's overall competitiveness — reducing costs and ensuring that the enterprise environment (regulation, infrastructure, availability of skills) are all supportive of those companies which can sustain and create jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4123">The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of key economic sectors which the Government will focus on to promote employment opportunities.  These sectors include Construction, Manufacturing, Wholesale and Retail, and Tourism, all of which are labour intensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4124">The Action Plan identifies a number of specific actions to facilitate the development of these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4125">Among the key actions identified for the Construction sector is the development of a National Strategy to 2015, which will outline the opportunities, challenges and actions needed to realise the potential of the sector.  Work has already commenced on this Strategy, and initial consultations have taken place with key stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4126">In relation to Manufacturing, the Government has committed to establishing a Manufacturing Development Forum to assist in identifying the needs of manufacturing enterprises and to progress a transformation agenda in the sector.  The Government will also develop a long term vision for the Manufacturing sector and put in place a strategic plan to deliver this vision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4127">A number of measures have already been introduced by the Government to support the Tourism sector, including a reduction in VAT rates from 13.5% to 9% on many hospitality services to the end of 2013, and the launch of The Gathering, which will take place in 2013 and will be Ireland's biggest ever tourism initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_4128">The Action Plan for Jobs also includes a range of measures which will impact positively on the retail and wholesale sectors, including the reform of statutory wage setting mechanisms, simplification and extension of the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, as well as the implementation of a number of the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Small Business.</p>
            <p eId="para_4129">Progress on the specific deliverables under the Action Plan for Jobs will be published on a Quarterly basis.  I anticipate that some of the measures I have outlined above will lead to further initiatives being undertaken in 2013 in relation to the sectors in question.  Any such initiatives will be included in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4134">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1st July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  As at 24th May 2012, 7,316 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,825 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website<i> www.jobbridge.ie</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_4136">The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that individuals availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be targeted at those in receipt of a Live Claim (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance/Signing for Credits) for 78 days of the last 6 months.  Time spent on certain government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources to those in receipt of a Live Claim or on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4139">It is not currently proposed to broaden the eligibility criteria of the scheme beyond the current requirements.  My Department will however continue to monitor all aspects of the Scheme on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_4143">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  In the interests of fairness and equity applications are processed in order of the date on which they were received in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4144">A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation project when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">Accurate processing time figures are not available at present as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems.  The average time to award an application at present is estimated at around 28 weeks.  There are currently approximately 8,670 new applications registered and awaiting a decision and approximately 360 new applications are received each week.  I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">In addition to the deployment of new systems, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working and temporary staff to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  However, it is expected to be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4147">In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</p>

This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation project when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4211">Accurate processing time figures are not available at present as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems. The average time to award an application at present is estimated at around 28 weeks.  There are currently approximately 8,670 new applications registered and awaiting a decision and approximately 360 new applications are received each week.  I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4212">In addition to the deployment of new systems, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working and temporary staff to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  However, it is expected to be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4213">In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</p>

            <p eId="para_4216">I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 328 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4217">Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that Ireland now faces.  It is essential, therefore, that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensuring work is worthwhile. To this end, last year I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4218">In its terms of reference, the Group has been asked to examine a number of specific issues and make recommendations on them, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and any other issues that may be referred to the Group, which includes the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4219">The Group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support. Decisions in respect of publishing reports of the Group will be made at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4220">The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports. The report of the Group's examination of this issue is currently receiving my consideration and it is my intention to publish this report in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_4221">Among the other issues that the Advisory Group is currently progressing are the issue of social welfare entitlements for the self-employed and the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance. The Group will revert to me with its reports on these issues once their examination of the various issues is completed.   Thereafter, I expect that the Group will address the other issues provided for in its terms of reference in a time frame to be determined and agreed by the chairperson, in consultation with the members of the Group, with a view to concluding its work programme as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_4222">Given the nature of the information, I do not propose to provide this information in tabular form at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4224">Deserted wife's benefit is a payment made to a woman deserted by her husband.  Entitlement to payment is based on social insurance contributions paid by the wife or her husband.  The deserted wife's benefit scheme was closed to new applications with effect from 2 January 1997, when the one-parent family payment was introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_4225">The purpose of the household benefits package is to facilitate older people, people with disabilities living alone and carers to participate more fully in society.  In general, people under 66 who do not have a disability related payment are not entitled to household benefits.  Deserted wife's benefit is therefore not a qualifying payment. Likewise, one parent family payment, which replaced deserted wife's benefit in 1997 for new applicants, is not a qualifying payment.  A person in receipt of deserted wife's benefit who is over 66 may be eligible for household benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_4226">As the household benefits are non-statutory, it is not possible to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_4228">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 94,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4229">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4230">For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.  Analysis of the Carlow market shows that there are a limited number of rental properties available to single persons in comparison to other larger properties available in the area.  However, accommodation is available, including shared accommodation, for single persons within the prescribed limits.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4231">It should be stressed however, that there will be no case of homelessness from this measure.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this stage there are no plans to revise the existing rent limits.</p>

        <b>Deputy Gerry Adams</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         the number of appellants of social welfare decisions in Counties Louth and Meath that are awaiting oral hearing; the timeframe for getting oral hearing; the number of cases awaiting a medical assessor; the number of medical assessors there are for the Louth/Meath region and the hours they work in the appeals section.

            <p eId="para_4269">I have been advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that statistics are not maintained on a county-by-county basis.  Therefore, it is not in a position to supply the information sought by the Deputy in relation to counties Louth and Meath.  Based on figures for the first four months of 2012, the overall average waiting time for appeals was 40.5 weeks for those appeals that required an oral hearing.  These average processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period, including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4270">By its nature and its quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes some time.  By definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  Medical Assessors perform in-person assessments on illness-related cases involving Illness Benefit and Disablement Benefit.  While there are no Medical Assessors permanently assigned for in-person assessment work solely in the Louth-Meath region, this region is frequently serviced by a pool of nine Medical Assessors based in the Dublin area.  Medical centres in highly populated areas in this region such as Drogheda, Navan and Dundalk are frequently selected for scheduling for in-person assessment, often two weeks out of every four for Drogheda and Navan and one week in every three or four for Dundalk.</p>
            <p eId="para_4271">The weekly travel itinerary or caseload for in-person assessments provided to each Medical Assessor is based on an up-to-date appraisal of which centres need to be visited.  That, in turn, is based on the current number of outstanding referrals, including appeals referrals, the frequency of recent visits to centres and an up-to-date assessment of available building, medical assessor and nurse resources for each centre.  Cases for schemes such as Illness Benefit at the initial stage, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carers Allowance and Benefit, Respite Care Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance are all assessed by Medical Assessors on-line at desk.  If the cases pertaining to these schemes progress to appeal stage (except Illness Benefit cases), they are also assessed on-line and at desk.  However, all outstanding cases for desk assessment work, including those for customers based in the Louth-Meath region, can be accessed and performed on line by Medical Assessors based in Dublin, Longford, Cork, Kilkenny and Donegal.  In appeals cases pertaining to all schemes, a different Medical Assessor from the Medical Assessor who performed the original assessment must be assigned.</p>

            <p eId="para_4277">Any person who has an appeal lodged on an Invalidity Pension claim is entitled to make a claim for Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Assistance pending the appeal decision.  It should be borne in mind, however, that the primary focus of the Invalidity and Jobseeker's   schemes is fundamentally different and as a result they have different qualification conditions.  Invalidity Pension is a payment focused towards people who are permanently incapable of work because of an illness or incapacity.  To qualify for payment, the person concerned must satisfy both the medical and social insurance (PRSI) conditions of the scheme.  Jobseeker payments are focused towards unemployed persons and to qualify for payment the person concerned must be capable of work and genuinely seeking employment. They must also satisfy other eligibility criteria such as a minimum level of social insurance (PRSI) conditions in the case of Jobseeker's Benefit and a maximum level of means in the case of Jobseeker's Assistance.  A critical factor in these circumstances is whether the person concerned is capable of work.  If the person has had their application for Invalidity Pension disallowed on the grounds that they were considered by a Medical Assessor to be not permanently incapable of work, they would automatically be considered as fulfilling the ‘capability' condition of the Jobseeker schemes.  In addition to a possible entitlement to a Jobseeker Payment, a person who is disallowed Invalidity Pension may, have an entitlement to Illness benefit or Disability allowance.  They can also apply for a Supplementary Welfare Allowance payment if they urgently need income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_4279">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1 July 2011.  It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.  The Scheme has made significant progress to date.  As at 24 May 2012, 7,316 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,825 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website,<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.  Our records indicate that almost 40% of the finishers to date have progressed directly into employment on immediate completion of their internship with either their JobBridge Host Organisation or another company.  It is important to note that this data does not take account of an intern who may have secured employment in the subsequent weeks or months after completing their internship.  A picture of the career paths of JobBridge interns will become clearer following the independent evaluation of the scheme which is being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  Given the successes to date of the Scheme including the encouraging levels of progression into employment within the six or nine month internships period, it is not currently proposed to extend the duration of the Scheme beyond the current duration.  My Department will continue to monitor all aspects of the Scheme on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_4281">Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%.  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed people would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet a commitment made in the programme for Government.  Among the issues the Advisory Group is considering is the question of providing social insurance cover for self-employed people to establish whether such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in the next few weeks, will examine this matter.  Self-employed individuals who fall on hard times or are without work for some time may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments.  Those who have been previously self-employed can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last 12 months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>

         if the current Departmental study with regard to pension schemes will include an examination of the wind-up costs for deferred member; her views on whether a chargeable search through the Revenue or her Department would not only bring in extra money into the State but would reduce the cost to pension schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4312">My Department, in conjunction with the Pensions Board and the Central Bank, and with assistance from PricewaterhouseCoopers, is undertaking a study on the level of pension charges and expenses associated with different forms of private pension arrangements.  The study includes the range of pension arrangements: funded defined benefit pension arrangements; defined contribution occupational pension schemes (insured and non-insured) including Additional Voluntary Contributions in Public Sector Schemes; Retirement annuity contracts and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.  The focus of the study is on those charges or expenses that have the effect of reducing members' or employers' contributions or investment returns.  The study does not include the costs associated with the wind-up of a scheme.  The study will provide information which had not been available previously and will provide an initial benchmark in relation to the level and transparency of charges.  This will be important in informing policy and in determining whether any further measures are required.  Pension schemes are obliged to make every effort to trace all members of a scheme when their entitlements become due.  My Department supports this by providing a mail hosting service for pension schemes that are unable to locate scheme members.  This service operates by sending a letter to a person's last known address asking them to make contact with their pension company.  A group chaired by my Department and comprising representatives from the Pensions Board and the Revenue Commissioners has considered ways of facilitating a more enhanced pension tracing facility.  As a result, my Department is working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to put in place an automated solution to capture the required data which will facilitate a person to trace his or her accrued pension rights in former employment.  A decision on whether to charge for this service has yet to be made.</p>

TESG is designed to support a person to overcome identified barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment.  The grant can be used to purchase of training (where this cannot be provided by a state provider within a reasonable time) or for certain other expenditures such as purchase of tools, travel costs to job interviews.  Training, with limited exceptions, must be on certified courses.  TESG meets the full costs of these supports up to €500 per jobseeker.  If, following the provision of the reason for a decision, a person, or service provider, remains dissatisfied with the decision and explanation, a review of the decision may be sought in which case the application is re-examined by a more senior officer not involved in the original decision.  Information on the number of persons who availed of the TESG in each of the years 2007 to date in 2012 is set out in the table below.</p>

            <p eId="para_4453">In cases where a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) in order to ascertain whether s/he is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4454">This follow-up activity takes place as soon as possible after the award of payment.  However, certain categories of liable relative are not pursued due to personal circumstances, such as age or allegations of violence or because they have low incomes.  The method of assessment of the liable relative's ability to pay is set out in regulations (SI 571 of 2006 and SI 142 of 2007) and the assessment is based on net income with certain allowances being deducted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4455">All liable relatives assessed with maintenance liability are contacted by the Department and are issued with a Determination Order setting out the amount of contribution assessed.  In 2011, details in relation to 12,657 liable relatives were recorded and Determination Orders were issued in 1,856 (14.66%) of the cases examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_4456">As a result, 489 liable relatives commenced making payments/additional payments to the lone parent(s) in 2011.  A further 25 liable relatives started paying the Department directly.  The Department is following-up with the remainder of cases with a view to securing payment as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_4457">It is estimated that this work resulted in savings of €3.8m in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4458">According to the Department's records, approximately 31% of those in receipt of OFP are also in receipt of maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">The issue of maintenance payments is first and foremost a private matter for the persons concerned or if they cannot resolve the problem, for the courts through family law provisions.</p>

This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4519">In relation to question raised by the Deputy I take it that the Deputy is referring to the changes to the rate bands which will be introduced in September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4520">This change means that pension payments made, for new customers, will reflect PRSI payments made over a working life. Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4521">From September 2012, a lower pension will be payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of less than 48 PRSI contributions which better relates to their PRSI record. This measure introduces additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) to more fairly reflect the proportionality of attachment to the workforce by the claimant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4522">The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach outlined below where those who pay more, benefit more.   I have set out below, for information, the new rate bands below.</p>
            <p eId="para_4523">Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4524">There is also an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension as the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_4525">Taking all of these factors into consideration, I introduced legislation in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 to abolish the State pension (transition) with effect from January 2014 standardising pension age at 66 years.  The State pension (contributory) age will be increased in 2021 to 67 years and to 68 years with effect from 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_4526">In the future, a ‘total contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.   The current proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.</p>
            <p eId="para_4527">The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4528">All information relating to the changes that I have outlined here is also available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_4617">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4618">There are numerous qualifying conditions for the rent supplement scheme all of which are based on legislation. For example, any person seeking a rent supplement must satisfy the Department that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant. The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4619">Entitlement to rent supplement is determined under Chapter 11 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended and under S.I. No. 412 of 2007, Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations 2007, as amended. These legislative provisions are supported by staff guidelines issued by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4620">In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined. The claim from the person concerned has previously been refused as the child is being adequately accommodated by the mother. The refusal has been upheld by the HSE appeals office.</p>

            <p eId="para_4639">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1st   July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.

            <p eId="para_4640">The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. As at 24th May 2012, 7,316 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,825 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_4641">Our records indicate that almost 40% (966) of the finishers to date have progressed directly into employment on immediate completion of their internship with either their JobBridge Host Organisation or another company. It is important to note that this data does not take account of an intern who may have secured employment in the subsequent weeks or months after completing their internship.  A picture of the career paths of JobBridge interns will become clearer following the independent evaluation of the scheme which is being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4642">A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to maintain the integrity of the JobBridge scheme.  In order for all applications from host organisations to be approved they must meet a number of criteria so as to ensure that the potential internships are of sufficient quality.  These include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4643">that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4644">that the internship is not displacing an employee; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4645">that the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4646">These checks are undertaken by staff in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4647">In order for an internship to commence a Standard Internship Agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation. This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4648">To ensure compliance with the scheme, the Department of Social Protection are monitoring internships to ensure that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4649">This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports that are required to be submitted by the host organisation verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement. In addition, contact with the host organisations and interns including random site visits have begun as part of this process.  These visits are undertaken by staff in the Regions.  In excess of 100 Monitoring visits have taken place to-date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4650">A ‘whistle blowing' feature is also in place, whereby any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the JobBridge team. All such claims are fully investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4651">It is worth noting that participation in the Scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge team at any stage of their internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4652">I believe that these measures are currently sufficient in relation to the operation of the JobBridge scheme. However, my Department continuously monitors the scheme and will introduce additional measures if the need arises.</p>
            <p eId="para_4653">I have also commissioned an independent evaluation of the Scheme which is currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants. This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, It will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment. It will also offer an assessment of the potential displacement effect of the Scheme and the satisfaction of participants and of Host Organisations with their experience. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.</p>
            <p eId="para_4654">It should also assist my Department in making further policy decisions on the benefit of work placement programmes in the overall context of the Government's activation policy, which is to engage with every unemployed individual to provide them with a pathway to employment and to prevent and reduce long term unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4671">The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4672">Before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme, a range of complex issues need to be addressed.  These include the extent of coverage; the duration of payment; the rate of payment; compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate; and how to ensure that a scheme of statutory sick pay would be enforced and policed.    The potential impact on small and medium size enterprises would be contingent on how these issues are addressed and how the scheme would ultimately be structured.  A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism in the private sector indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add about €1 per week per employee to the costs of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4673">I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay in February of this year.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders, including representatives of small and medium-size employers.  The report of that seminar will be published shortly and will provide the basis for more detailed consultations with key stakeholders.  The analysis of the potential impacts of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay will be developed and refined as consultation with key stakeholders progresses.</p>

            <p eId="para_4698">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1st July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4699">The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. As at 24th May 2012, 7,316 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.

In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_4700">A host organisation participating in JobBridge must be in a position to provide a substantial commitment to their intern so as to ensure the provision of a quality internship.  To this end, a clear set of rules have been developed to protect the intern and safeguard JobBridge from potential abuse.  Potential host organisations can avail of the JobBridge guidelines and full eligibility criteria on the JobBridge website.   The process for Host Organisations to apply and advertise positions is also clearly outlined on the website.</p>
            <p eId="para_4701">In relation to the more specific matter raised by the Deputy, I wish to advise that schools are currently eligible to participate in JobBridge.  In this regard, I wish to advise that there are currently in excess of 250 internship placements in the Education sector.  There are currently 92 internship placements across primary and secondary schools.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_818">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4712">The Government has made decisions on a number of changes to State pension provision including the changes to the rate bands which will come into effect from September 2012 for new customers:</p>
            <p eId="para_4713">Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  From September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) will be introduced to more fairly reflect the attachment to the workforce by the claimant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4714">The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more.  I have set out below, for information, the new rate bands below.</p>
            <p eId="para_4715">In relation to changes to the eligibility criteria for widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension,  currently either the claimant or their late spouse or civil partner must have a minimum of 156 paid social insurance contributions paid to the date of death of the spouse/civil partner or before reaching pension age (currently, age 66) whichever is earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_4716">Where the date of death of a spouse or civil partner is on or after 27th December 2013, the minimum number of paid social insurance contributions required will be increased to 260 paid contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4717">In addition, with effect from 6th April 2012, late claims for the State pension (transition), State pension (contributory), widow's, widower's or surviving partner's contributory pension will be limited to a maximum period of 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4718">I would like to take this opportunity to again outline the context for these changes. Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4719">There is also an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension, including the forthcoming change to pension rate bands being introduced for new customers from September 2012, which is that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4720">There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_4721">Taking all of these factors into consideration, I introduced legislation in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 to abolish the State pension (transition) with effect from January 2014 thereby standardising pension age at 66.   The State pension (contributory) age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and to 68 with effect from 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_4722">In the future, a ‘total contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.   The current proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.</p>
            <p eId="para_4723">The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4724">All information relating to the changes that I have outlined here are also available on my Department's website.</p>

         if he is satisfied with the conditions under which the National Archives is operating in view of the fact that a warehouse is being used as temporary storage; the cost of building and maintaining said warehouse; when it is intended to provide a permanent building with adequate facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4928">I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 and 477 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4929">Firstly, I should point out that the National Archives building at Bishop Street is not a temporary storage building. It, along with the associated facility at the Four Courts, is the permanent home for the National Archives.  While there have been issues with the Bishop Street building over the years, my Department, with the Office of Public Works (which has overall responsibility for the building), has endeavoured to improve the facilities there. Over the last year, almost €700,000 was spent to replace the roof and defective shutters and in making the warehouse watertight.  This work was key to safeguarding the State's archives and will allow heretofore unseen files and papers be made available to the public. This will be the first stage of a phased improvement scheme that will aim to maximise the internal storage capacity of the facility.  I am currently awaiting a costed scheme from the Office of Public Works in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4930">As the Deputies are aware, there have been necessary reductions in programme and capital funding for all public bodies, including the National Archives and other cultural institutions, in recent years.  Clearly, the economic realities pertaining to the public finances have to be addressed, while endeavouring at all times to maintain services to the public at our national cultural institutions.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the impact that a ban on eel fishing is having in terms of loss of a particular heritage and unique fishing style using traditional hand-made wicker basket from Carrick-on-Suir that has been practised for generations in the Suir estuary; his views on the way that these very specialised and uniquely Irish practices that are distinctive to this region might be documented and the knowledge recorded, preserved and passed on to future generations; if he has liaised with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to this issue; the progress that has been made; if he has not liaised with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, if he will consider working with them in order to preserve a distinctive heritage and fishing style that has been practised for generations, and the knowledge retained by a small group of people but which is in danger of being lost forever; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4935">Under the EU Habitats Directive, each Member State is required to designate Special Areas of Conservation for the protection of endangered habitats and species as listed in the Directive. As part of Ireland's obligations under the Directive, 53 Special Areas of Conservation were nominated for designation between 1997 and 2002 for the protection of Active Raised Bog, Degraded Raised Bog still capable of natural regeneration and Bog Woodland. Each of these habitats is listed in Annex I of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4936">The choice of sites for selection as SACs arose from an extensive survey of the habitats in Ireland and the application of the scientific criteria specified in Annex III of the Directive. In short, the criteria used included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4937">The degree of representivity of the natural habitat type on the site.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4938">The area of the site covered by the natural habitat type in relation to the total area covered by that natural habitat type within national territory.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4939">The degree of conservation of the structure and functions of the natural habitat type concerned and restoration possibilities.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4940">A global assessment of the value of the site for conservation of the natural habitat type concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4941">The reasoning behind the nomination for designation of each individual site is contained in the<i>Natura 2000 standard data form,</i> which can be viewed on my Department’s website at <i>www.npws.ie</i>. The ownership of these bogs was not a central consideration in their selection and the 53 sites comprised both State-owned and privately-owned lands. I am advised that most State-owned or privately-owned raised bogs outside of the areas selected for designation do not meet the criteria for selection as SACs. In most cases, the living surface of the bog has been removed. In a few cases, the bog surface has not been removed but the areas were extensively drained, resulting in the loss of the most sensitive species.</p>

            <p eId="para_4948">Under the Government's Medium Term Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016, some €190m has been committed to my Department's Vote Group over the next 5 years.

            <p eId="para_4949">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department's capital expenditure relates principally to meeting the ongoing costs of the Irish Film Board, the National Cultural Institutions, works to address EU compliance requirements in relation to our built and natural heritage, supporting employment through Údarás na Gaeltachta, and maintenance and development works carried out by Waterways Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_5160">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enabling the publication of the 1926 Census. The project requires two principal components to be addressed.  The first is the legal necessity to change the relevant legislation to permit publication of the Census before the expiry of the statutory 100 year period, while respecting certain rights. The second is the technical process whereby the material can be converted from the paper records to a searchable electronic database in a cost-effective fashion.</p>

            <p eId="para_5163">The Government announced a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of €1,500 per year, index linked, for15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State. An additional once-off payment of €500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_5164">One of the qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is that the claimant must have been cutting turf on the lands in question in the relevant five year period. If an individual has a legal interest in one of the 53 designated sites and had not been extracting turf in the relevant five year period, my Department is willing to examine the feasibility of relocating such interests to alternative non-designated bogs. It is not proposed to make the financial payment in such cases.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5172">I propose to take Questions Nos. 486, 487, 492 and 495 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5173">My Department has a broad range of responsibilities in respect to the protection of our natural, architectural and archaeological heritage and, in each case, there is a different suite of legislative instruments that provides for protection of the relevant national heritage sites.  The primary conservation measures for which the Deputy has sought information are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5174">Natural Heritage Areas (NHA), Special Areas of Conservation Areas (SAC), Special Protection Areas (SPA), Nature Reserves, Flora Protection Orders and Refuges for Fauna made under the Habitats Regulations 1997-2011, transposing the EU Habitats and Birds Directives and the Wildlife Acts 1976-2000;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5175">Structures included in Record of Protected Structures and Architectural Conservation Areas under Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5176">Sites protected under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_5177">My Department directly manages 6 national parks and 66 nature reserves. In addition, as noted above, it has responsibility for the monitoring of European nature sites established under the Birds and Habitats Directives, as well as a range of sites established under the Wildlife Acts. All sites designated for nature conservation have been identified as requiring protection and are monitored on an on-going basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5178">Under the provisions of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures. The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities. Inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them, seek to safeguard their future and serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5179">Section 59 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011 provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of such structures. On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served in 2008, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2010. My Department does not have the relevant information for 2007 and figures for 2011 are currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_5180">The 757 national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are managed and maintained by the Office of Public Works on a day to day basis. Local authorities are responsible for monuments in their ownership or guardianship. The vast majority of recorded monuments (approx 120,000) are, however, privately owned and, while they are protected under the National Monuments Acts, the owners are responsible for their maintenance. Appropriate action is taken where my Department becomes aware of threats or damage to monuments, including advice to owners, prosecution under the National Monuments Acts or, occasionally, rescue excavation work.</p>
            <p eId="para_5181">The management and delivery of specific conservation projects is generally carried out through bodies such as the OPW, local authorities and heritage organisations that receive grants awarded by the Heritage Council. This does not include private investment in conservation projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5182">In the context of the above, my Department does not collate comprehensive information on the numbers of reports of actual damage or threats of damage to protected structures and sites. Information on the number of conservation measures in respect of sites or buildings taken in each of the past three years by location is not available to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5183">The Deputy will appreciate that the scope to provide for the protection of the State's heritage assets is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances. However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow, in accordance with best practice and legal requirements, both nationally and internationally, and will intervene as provided by law to protect such sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_5184">Finally as regards current and on-going initiatives to assist in the safe guarding of our Built Heritage, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a number of key developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5185">In 2011 my Department set up an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders to review the operation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011. This review includes an examination of how the legislation is operating in practice regarding the protection and management of architectural heritage from a central and local government perspective and the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, to consider alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5186">In the context of the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015, my Department is developing various policy actions which contribute to the protection and appropriate re-use of our built heritage and aims to deal with on-going strategic objectives indirectly effecting our architectural heritage such as adaptive re-use for historic properties and a forward plan-led approach to cultural heritage and urban design in our towns and cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5187">My Department is responsible for the legislative framework, general policy development and promotional awareness of Ireland's built heritage. My Department also provides some limited funding for the built heritage directly or through the OPW. €1,252,000 has been provided in this year's Estimates for built heritage capital. My Department also provides funding to the Heritage Council, which, in turn, supports many heritage projects throughout the country. My Department is providing a total of €4,811,000 of Exchequer Funding for the Heritage Council in 2012, together with €1,500,000 from the Department's share of the Environment Fund. Final allocations for future years have not been decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_5188">While the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances pose considerable challenges, my Department continues to work creatively across Government and with partner bodies such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, Fáilte Ireland, the LEADER Programme and other heritage interests in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5191">I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 490 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5192">There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation (SACs) in Kildare protected under the EU Habitats Directive. There are also 2 Natural Heritage Area raised bogs in Kildare designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5193">The Government has put in place a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of €1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State. An additional once-off payment of €500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_5194">The townlands of Coolearagh East and West in County Kildare are close to Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation and to Hodgestown Bog natural heritage area (NHA).</p>
            <p eId="para_5195">Discussions have been ongoing with turf cutter representatives from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation.  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters similar to relocation arrangements already concluded with groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and Mountbellew in County Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_5196">In 2010, the then Government decided that turf-cutting should come to an end on raised bog natural heritage areas at the end of 2013. However, in accordance with the Programme for Government, t  he situation regarding the 75 raised bog NHAs will be reviewed in conjunction with the Peatlands Council and decisions will be made in advance of the cutting season in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_5197">Details of raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas in County Kildare are set out in the table, including the number of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, the number of applications acknowledged, the number of applicants expressing an interest in relocation out of the applications acknowledged, and the number of payments made.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5224">The Government's priorities for the arts are set out in the Programme for Government. Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved primarily to the Arts Council.  The Council is a statutory body, funded by my Department, and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5225">I am acutely aware of the beneficial effects of arts in the community, both from the aspect of individual participation and that of community involvement, as well as their potential for impact in addressing social inclusion issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_5226">Since taking office, I have engaged extensively with the arts community at local and national levels.  Following dialogue with local arts officers, a pilot interactive strategy has been put in place, which, I believe, will lead to more co-ordination in arts and culture activities at community and at local level. Many projects have received capital funding under the arts capital schemes operated by my Department.  These projects — situated in the heart of communities — assist in local arts endeavours and I would urge communities to support and participate in the many and diverse range of activities offered by them throughout the State.  Details of these payments are on my Department's website<i>http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/Arts/ GrantsandFunding/CulturalDevelopmentExpenditure/</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_5227">As the Deputy is aware, I also forwarded details to him on 25 April last of financial assistance provided by my Department to bodies/groups over the period since the establishment of my Department on 2 June 2011. In addition, I supplied information received from the Arts Council, which included assistance to groups in Co Kildare.</p>

            <p eId="para_5229">My Department is committed to enhancing our traditional culture by supporting groups and organisations involved in furthering the traditional arts. Since 2005, €20m has been provided in capital grant aid to organisations that promote traditional music and song such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and Na Píobairí Uilleann (The Pipers Club) for infrastructural development throughout the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5230">My Department provides an annual current grant to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  In 2012, this amounts to €1.675m.  Comhaltas has over 400 branches nationwide and has been to the fore in training young people in the traditional arts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5231">Other organisations funded by my Department that encourage and foster the traditional arts of music and singing include the Arts Council, Foras na Gaeilge and Ealaín na Gaeltachta. These organisations provide funding to the many festivals held in the country every year where thousands of young people participate and are encouraged to develop their artistic talents. My Department also assists An Gael-Acadamh, which provides a range of classes for young people in the Connemara Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_5232">I would especially like to direct the Deputy to<i>Culturefox</i>, an initiative paid for by my Department to promote the arts and culture.  <i>Culturefox</i> is both a website and an “app”, and has a separate section for the promotion of traditional music and song. It is free to use for promoters and consumers alike.</p>

            <p eId="para_5235">Culture Ireland   also works closely with Tourism Ireland on a range of co-operative ventures, including promotional material for priority markets such as New York, joint support for events such as St. Patrick's Festival in Beijing and cross-promotion of Irish arts events abroad to maximise their cultural tourism potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_5236">In 2011<i>Culture Ireland</i> presented <i>Imagine Ireland,</i>   a special year-long initiative, showcasing Irish arts and culture in the US throughout the year in an endeavour to provide a strategic platform to promote Irish tourism. More than 1,000 Irish artists were showcased in more than 500 events in more than 40 US States, working in partnership with key US festivals, venues and cultural institutions. Clusters of events were targeted to maximise the impact of key promotional opportunities, including St. Patrick’s week and Bloomsday, coordinating with Tourism Ireland and the Irish Embassy and Consulates. In the current year, it is seeking to build on that initiative and will also have an important role to play in the delivery of the Government’s cultural programme for the E. Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5237">In addition, in 2013,<i>Culture Ireland</i>   will continue to work closely with Tourism Ireland and The Gathering to showcase and celebrate Irish culture and encourage visitors to Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_5243">Arising from the critical role of the media in our democracy, and the potentially harmful effects of an over concentration of media ownership, this issue is a vitally important one.  I have written to my colleague, Minister Bruton, in relation to the possibility of extracting the media merger-related provisions from the proposed Consumer and Competition Bill and this issue remains under discussion.  The Government is committed to implementing a set of robust measures that allow for a transparent and objective assessment of the public good in media mergers cases, and to do so as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5252">Exchequer funding of €76.146 million has been allocated to the Better Energy Programme in 2012, which is projected to deliver 524GWh in energy savings.  The Better Energy Programme includes Better Energy Homes, Warmer Homes and Better Energy Workplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_5253">Better Energy Homes provides financial assistance to householders who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.  Since the scheme commenced in March 2009 the SEAI has disbursed over €133m in grants and supported the installation of over 300,000 such measures in 126,761 homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5254">Better Energy Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the SEAI and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Since the commencement of the Programme in 2000 energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 82,669 homes amounting to €82.959 million in Exchequer funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_5281">I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 to 504, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5282">I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that surveys of transitional or estuarine waters during the monitoring of eels stocks under Ireland's Eel Management Plan (EMP) over the last three years showed differences between each water body and between the transitional waters and lakes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5283">The transitional waters contained significantly smaller eels than the lakes. The highest catch per unit effort values were recorded in the transitional waters of the Barrow/Nore/Suir.  Low recapture of tagged eels most likely indicate high levels of movement within these transitional waters and make population estimation difficult    The current data make it very challenging to provide an estimate of silver eel escapement/production for such a large transitional water bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5284">Due to the difficulties in obtaining density estimates for eels in large water bodies and the migratory habits of eels moving upstream into the rivers and/or leaving the transitional water as silver eel, estimating silver eel escapement/production for transitional waters remains extremely challenging.</p>
            <p eId="para_5285">The incorporation of baited pots into the national eel survey to establish a catch per unit effort time series will not address the current challenges of deriving a robust population estimate for eels in transitional waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_5286">Telemetry studies, currently underway, will give a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and improve population density estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_5287">The National Eel Management Plan prepared in 2009 is currently being updated following the provision of three additional years of scientific research and monitoring of the status of Eels stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5288">Posting of the latest independent Standing Scientific Committee reports on eels onto Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI)'s website is imminent and a link to this publication will also be available on the Department's website. IFI's three year eel monitoring report will also available on line.</p>
            <p eId="para_5289">Ireland's Eel Management Plan Implementation report, which details progress on Ireland's 2009 Eel Management Plan, is due to be submitted to the EU by the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_5290">In relation to the information contained in these reports and prior to consideration of the continuation of existing measures, a public consultation period will commence this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_5291">Submissions made during the public consultation period will be considered in formulating proposals for the management of the eel fishery for the coming years. Existing stakeholders shall be advised of the consultation period and invited to attend a series of seminars detailing the latest scientific data.</p>

            <p eId="para_5484">The level of exploration activity offshore Ireland is low, with on average only one to two wells drilled per year over the past decade.  As a consequence of the low level of drilling activity there are no offshore drilling rigs permanently based in Ireland.  When an exploration well is to be drilled exploration companies engage an international drilling contractor to bring a rig along with its existing crew to carry out the drilling operation.  Exploration drilling in the Irish offshore does give rise to some employment opportunities in ancillary supply/support areas such as ports.  Until there is a much higher level of exploration drilling in the Irish offshore, this situation is likely to remain unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_5485">By way of illustration of the low level of drilling, only one exploration well was drilled in the Irish offshore last year and while my Department is aware that plans are being advanced for further exploration drilling, no application for drilling approval has been received by my Department to date this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5489">Salmon quotas are allocated only in respect of individual rivers which are above their predetermined conservation limit and are based on annual scientific advice.  Allocations are made to two separate groups; commercial fishermen and recreational anglers (including domestic and tourist anglers) based on consultation within the local Fishery District Committees comprised of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) representatives and local stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5490">These quotas are strictly controlled and enforced by IFI.  Essentially any fish landed from an agreed allocation must be recorded by means of a unique numbered and colour coded tag.  Tagging is an important element in the battle against poaching via helping to enforce the conditions under which wild salmon can be legally caught or offered for sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_5491">Salmon caught by anglers are marked with a blue tag and it is illegal to offer a fish bearing a blue tag for sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_5492">A commercially caught whole salmon is tagged with green, white or orange tag (to indicate fishing method), which is uniquely numbered to assist traceability.  Salmon tagged in these categories may only be offered for sale by fishermen or dealers who are specifically licensed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5493">IFI takes very seriously its obligation to safeguard wild stocks in line with conservation imperatives and invests very significant time and resources protecting the wild salmon stock in rivers and along our coast.  I am satisfied that they are doing all that is possible to reduce illegal fishing, protect the resource and to ensuring that the commercial and recreational fishermen adhere to their licensing conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5494">If members of the public suspect that illegal fishing is taking place they should advice IFI via the poaching and pollution hotline 1890-347424 and report suspected incidents.</p>

            <p eId="para_5497">The universal service obligation is a form of safety net, ensuring by way of regulatory obligations that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.

            <p eId="para_5501">Section 124(2) of the Act charges the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) with carrying out an annual review of the extent to which RTÉ and TG4 have fulfilled their commitments in respect of their public service objects.

            <p eId="para_5507">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  The Act has a starting position of a universal liability for residential property and then goes on to exempt certain properties, the most important exemption being where the property concerned is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5508">The Act does not provide for waivers and instead places collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities.  I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the 'care and management' provisions in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  In such cases, the guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  Enquiries in this regard should be directed to the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_5510">In March 2012 there were 34 City and County Managers, 29 Chief Fire Officers, and 164 Senior Engineers employed in local authorities. The salaries of City and County managers, senior engineers and chief fire officers are set out in the tables below.</p>
            <p eId="para_5511">Local authority senior management structures are being downsized. The numbers of Directors of Service have decreased by 23% since 2008, from 262 in June 2008 to 209 currently and local authorities are working towards the Local Government Efficiency Review (LGER) target of 190 Directors. A workforce planning process is underway which in the first instance concentrates on the implementation of the recommendations of the LGER in respect of senior management in local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5512">The Government has approved proposals to establish single local authorities to replace Limerick County Council and Limerick City Council and North and South Tipperary County Councils, by mid 2014. In both cases, the establishment of interim management arrangements, whereby a single person would oversee both authorities in the run up to full merger, was also approved. The amalgamation of the Limerick and Tipperary local authorities will result in a reduction in the number of city and county managers and a reduction at the number of senior and middle management levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_5513">The wider local government reform proposals that I will be bringing to Government shortly will focus particularly on strengthening structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels and expanding the role of local government.

          <summary eId="sum_73">Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan): There is no legislation in Ireland regulating the height of trees and hedges.  I also understand that there is no right in Irish law to receive light in a garden, and that while there is a civil remedy available in nuisance in respect of the branches or roots of a neighbour’s trees encroaching on one’s property, there is no civil law remedy in respect of the loss of light in a garden due to a neighbour’s high trees or hedges.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_74">I do not propose to introduce legislation to deal with this issue but I intend to write to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, suggesting that we might give consideration to potential alternative options towards the introduction of a civil remedy in this matter.</summary>

            <p eId="para_5612">A new emissions based motor tax system was introduced in 2008, together with changes to Vehicle Registration Tax, in order to influence the future purchasing decisions of car buyers.  The owners of vehicles, including dual fuel vehicles, registered prior to 1 July 2008 continue to pay motor tax on the basis of engine capacity.  Tax on dual fuel vehicles, which do not have zero levels of carbon emissions, is based on the CO2 emissions level of the vehicle, as shown on the manufacturer's Certificate of Conformity, if registered after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5613">I do not anticipate that the current review of the CO2 banding and rates for motor tax for post-2008 vehicles will change the basis for charging motor tax for dual fuel vehicles.</p>

            <p eId="para_5622">The Government decided on 17 April 2012, that Irish Water should be established as independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.  Irish Water will be a public utility, wholly owned by the State.  The water service will remain in public ownership as is the case in most countries in Europe and further afield.</p>
            <p eId="para_5623">BGE has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and has specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.  The skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5624">In the context of the Government's commitment under the Programme for Government and the EU/IMF Agreement in relation to State assets, the Government has decided to sell Bord Gáis Energy, which is a separate business unit of the Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) group dealing with electricity and gas supply as well as power generation.  The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining BGE's gas networks and interconnectors in State ownership.  I am confident that Bord Gáis will continue to contribute to achieving key Government and national objectives in its ongoing management of the strategic gas infrastructure as well as the sale of the Bord Gáis Energy business and the establishment of the new Irish water utility.</p>

            <p eId="para_5628">I have no plans currently to introduce a monthly direct debit payment option for motor tax.  The surcharge on non-annual vehicle licences was designed to cover the higher administrative costs involved.  Current surcharge levels are lower than the maximum permitted under motor tax law.</p>
            <p eId="para_5629">The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-year and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of €20m.  Were a monthly pro-rata system to be introduced, the loss in income would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.  It would also have a negative transitional impact on the flow of income to the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_5630">In considering options for payment by direct debit, regard would also have to be had to the set-up costs in the motor tax system, any increased ongoing administrative and financial controls/costs, bank charges, uncertainty as to payment of motor tax and subsequent problems for enforcement of non-payment and retrieval of motor tax discs.  In addition, changes of vehicle ownership, over 750,000 annually, undertaken during an instalment period could also present major problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_5655">Persons in receipt of social welfare payments are not specifically precluded from purchasing their home under any tenant purchase scheme.  However, if the applicants are applying to fund the purchase through loan finance from the local authority they must meet the criteria which apply to such loans.  Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and associated credit policy.  To ensure effective targeting of resources, loan finance continues to be available to first-time buyers only.  Income limits are also in place, distinguishing between single and dual income households and a maximum loan limit is applied.  In assessing loan applications local authorities take account of the household's ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_5656">In such cases, long-term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long-term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority.  All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.  These provisions apply for purposes of mortgage lending by all local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5681">The sites referred to in the questions were cited in relation to the European Court of Justice judgement in Case C 494/01 as an example of Ireland's failure to comply with the 1975 Waste Framework Directive.  My Department, on behalf of the State, has been liaising with the European Commission to ensure that the requirements of the judgement are fully met.  The Commission is concerned, as I am, to secure the urgent remediation of the sites, a concern underlined by an additional letter of formal notice issued on 30 September 2010, which indicated that the Commission might refer the case back to the Court of Justice for financial penalties to be imposed against Ireland for failure to comply with the judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5682">It is in these circumstances that my Department, in 2011, requested Wicklow County Council to remediate both sites, pursuant to its powers under section 56 of the Waste Management Act 1996.  The Whitestown site is being dealt with initially and the council, working with the Environmental Protection Agency, has established a technical working group to oversee a programme of detailed investigation of the areas of illegal waste at that site.  The purpose of this programme, which I understand is now complete, is to gain a greater understanding of the nature, character and distribution of the waste and to assist in determining the requirements for the site's remediation.  My Department is in ongoing contact with Wicklow County Council in relation to these sites and I understand that following a procurement process, remediation work will commence in the Autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_5683">The cost of remediation will be dependent on the technical approach taken to remediation and on the outcome of the tendering process.  The costs involved will be funded in the first instance by the State, with Wicklow County Council seeking cost recovery through the Courts.  To date, my Department has recouped some €1.3 million to Wicklow County Council in relation to the Whitestown site and further payments are anticipated for that site during 2012, and in respect of the Castleruddery site which it is envisaged will also be addressed this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5694">The initial transition strategy for the establishment of Irish Water as a public utility as recommended in the independent assessment envisages a staged approach involving local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water for a period, with Irish Water taking over their operations on a phased basis from January 2015, and the full transfer of operations being completed by end 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_5695">This approach to transition is the subject of further detailed analysis as part of the development of an implementation strategy, which is currently underway.   This more detailed implementation strategy for Irish Water will give further effect to the Government decision of 17 April to establish Irish Water as an independent State-owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.  The skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be paired with the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5696">It will ultimately be a matter for Irish Water to determine the staffing and skills required for the new organisation.  In the initial phase, Irish Water will work largely through service level agreements with local authorities.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean that the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5697">The Department has already had initial engagement with ICTU at the start of the independent assessment and as part of the consultation process.   There will be detailed engagement with staff and trade unions in the rollout of the proposed changes to ensure that the change is managed well.</p>

            <p eId="para_5707">I propose to take Questions Nos. 549 to 551, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5708">My Department manages the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages and assists the community's support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of people over 65 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_5709">The Scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5710">The funding provided this year for the Seniors Alert Scheme is €2.35m.</p>
            <p eId="para_5711">Funding provided for years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5712">2008 — €3.059m.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5713">2009 — €3.5m.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5714">2010 — €3.10m.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5715">2011 — €2.35m.</p>
            <p eId="para_5716">In 2011, grant support was available towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alert systems (pendant alarms) and other items to improve the safety and security of the home (including monitored smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, internal emergency lighting and external security lighting).</p>
            <p eId="para_5717">In 2011, the maximum grants for equipment were as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5718">Monitored Personal alarms (with pendant) — €250</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5719">Monitored Smoke Detectors (per unit) — €75</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5720">Monitored Carbon Monoxide Detectors (per unit) — €100</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5721">Additional pendant/Re-installation — €50</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5722">External Security lights — €120</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5723">Internal Emergency lighting — €50</p>
            <p eId="para_5724">Due to unprecedented demand for grant assistance under the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2011, the budget allocation of €2.35m was expended by the end of November 2011; there were a significant number of grant applications received in December 2011 that the Seniors Alert Unit was unable to grant-aid until receipt of the budget allocation for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5725">A significant portion of the 2012 budget allocation (€2.35m) was expended early in 2012 as a result of this unprecedented demand. The Seniors Alert Unit is also continuing to register Community and Voluntary groups who wish to administer the Scheme and this will have further implications for funding in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5726">As a result, my Department examined the operation of the scheme with the aim of ensuring its sustainability and an equitable distribution of funding country-wide. The following temporary changes were notified to groups on 26 March 2012, and took effect from 30 March 2012:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5727">Funding will continue to be available for the purchase and installation of socially monitored alarms at a maximum of €250 per alarm. Maximum funding of €50 is also available for additional pendants and reinstallations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5728">The aim of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to support independent living for those over 65 who live alone or who live with a person who is also over 65 years of age and of<i>limited financial means</i>.  A key element of the scheme is the provision of funding for a socially monitored alarm which supports this independence. Having regard to available funding in the current economic climate, my Department’s objective is to continue to maintain the scheme in a viable way and provide the maximum number of socially monitored alarms to as many older persons as possible in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5729">The temporary changes made under the scheme will be monitored on an on-going basis and may be revised later in the year in light of the overall demand for funding relative to the budget allocation for 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5759">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge. Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless entitled to claim a waiver or otherwise exempt.</p>
            <p eId="para_5760">The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5761">The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 30 May 2012, a total of 916,214 property declarations had been processed by the household charge bureau; 899,121 registered for payment of the charge, equating to some €90.3m; and 17,093 residential properties have been registered for a waiver from payment of the charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5762">In addition, an estimated 28,800 postal declarations have been received in the household charge bureau, which have yet to be processed; these equate to a further €2.88m. This gives a total number of 945,014 declarations made, equating to over €93m.</p>

            <p eId="para_5779">My Department is also examining a number of different payment options to facilitate householders to the fullest extent possible in the registration process. I have decided that when registration commences a reduced fee of €5 will be payable for the initial three months and a fee of €50 will apply thereafter.  Ample time will be provided for householders to comply with the requirement to register their on-site wastewater treatment systems. The current position regarding development of the registration facilities is included in an information leaflet published on my Department's website<i>www.environ.ie</i>. My Department will ensure that a public information campaign, including details of how and when to register, will be carried out in advance of registration commencing.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5854">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5855">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5863">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to further improve the energy efficiency of new buildings with a view to moving towards carbon neutral homes in the longer term. In tandem with this commitment, Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings requires EU Member States,<i>inter alia</i>, to ensure that all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy by 31 December 2020 (or by 31 December 2018 in the case of new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities).</p>
            <p eId="para_5864">The Directive broadly defines a ‘nearly zero-energy building' as a building with a high energy performance where the very low amount of energy required should, to a very significant extent, be met by energy from renewable sources, including renewable energy produced onsite or nearby.</p>
            <p eId="para_5865">Against this background, Ireland has been making significant progress in terms of both improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions within the built environment.  Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings.  These regulations came into effect on 1 July 2008 subject to certain transitional arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5866">Furthermore, last year, I signed the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document L — Conservation of Fuel and Energy — Dwellings (2011) into law.  These regulations came into effect on 1 December 2011 and build on the substantial improvements already introduced under the 2007 regulations by delivering a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5867">Part L 2011 marks an important step on the road to carbon neutrality and puts Ireland at the forefront of EU Member States in terms of energy efficiency standards for new dwellings.  All the signs indicate that Irish builders and manufacturers continue to innovate and adapt their approaches and products to meet new standards as they continue to evolve progressively over time.  This is important in terms of continuing the development of the market for energy efficient buildings and products domestically while also increasing the considerable potential that exists for high energy efficiency products in export markets. The new regulations are important in maintaining the momentum that has already been created in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5868">My Department is also working on the development of a framework for achieving a nearly zero energy framework for dwellings in order to meet our obligations under Directive 2010/31/EU within the prescribed timeframe.  It is anticipated that a nearly zero energy framework for dwellings will require further amendments to the building regulations over and above the recent Part L 2011 requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_5973">As part of the Government's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the 2012 estimates process, difficult decisions had to be taken in relation to prioritising funding for core services in all programme areas. The provisional funding estimate to support the mainstreamed drugs projects under my Department's Housing programme for 2012 was €100,000, compared with €400,000 in 2011.

            <p eId="para_5974">My Department is providing pro rata funding to fund the projects concerned until end June 2012 only, in order to allow the projects and other bodies to explore alternative funding mechanisms and identify resources to deliver on the overall objectives of the projects beyond end June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5975">Following a consultation process, South Dublin County Council has recently advised my Department that the Council has identified interim funding to maintain the projects concerned during the second half of 2012.

The Council has advised that this funding represents a once-off contribution and will allow the projects to continue while the report of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, on the review of the structures that underpin the strategy at local, regional and national level is finalised.  It is understood that this report will consider how current funding structures can be improved or streamlined, particularly with regard to local and regional drugs task forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_5976">The provision of interim funding by South Dublin County Council and the Tallaght Local Drugs Task Force for the second part of 2012 provides a further opportunity to the projects to source alternative funds and/or to identify an alternative model for the delivery of services in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_5978">The 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) is a twenty-year planning framework designed to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions, and it provides the spatial vision and principles for statutory regional planning guidelines across eight regions and for development plans at a local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5979">A comprehensive review of implementation of the NSS was undertaken during 2010, culminating in the publication in October 2010 of the NSS Update and Outlook Report (available at<i>www.environ.ie</i>). This report reaffirmed the commitment to implementing long-term planning frameworks such as the NSS and identified new priorities and objectives to deliver more consistent implementation at all levels, taking account of experience since 2002 and the new environmental, budgetary and economic challenges that Ireland continues to face. In particular, the 2010 Report identified a series of actions in respect of:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5980">better alignment and prioritisation of sectoral infrastructure investment,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5981">improved governance at national, regional and local levels, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5982">the promotion of more sustainable patterns of development, both in rural and urban contexts, through more effective, evidence-based planning policies, with the aim of maximising the role of NSS implementation in supporting overall economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_5983">In addition, the adoption of updated Regional Planning Guidelines in 2010 for the twelve-year period to 2022 and the new legislative provisions in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to include core strategies in development plans, taking account of regional policies, targets and priorities, are further embedding the NSS principles into the forward-planning process, and should help to deliver more co-ordinated, coherent and sustainable planning outcomes. I will as necessary consider the need for any further review of the National Spatial Strategy in light of evolving economic circumstances and the beneficial deployment of our now more constrained resources.</p>

        <b>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</b>
         if he will provide, in tabular form, the usage, per capita, of plastic bags each year since the introduction of the plastic bag levy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_934">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5985">The environmental levy on plastic bags was primarily introduced as an anti-litter measure and is designed to ensure people make more environmentally friendly choices by encouraging them to use reusable bags rather than disposable plastic bags.  The introduction of the levy in March 2002 led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers, from an estimated 328 bags per person per year prior to the introduction of the levy, to 21 bags per person by the end of 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_5986">The table following provides the estimated per capita usage of disposable plastic bags each year since the levy was introduced, using population data produced by the Central Statistics Office and the number of bags for which levy receipts were remitted by the Revenue Commissioners to the Environment Fund.  However, while the figures produced in the table below are indicative of trends in usage of disposable plastic bags, they are not a precise measurement of the number of bags supplied — each year's figure will also take into account levies recovered in respect of earlier periods on account of retailers filing late returns and the recoupment of levies due following Revenue audit findings.  Increases in levy receipts are also likely to arise from enforcement activity by local authorities and audit activity by the Revenue Commissioners, while fluctuations in levy receipts are also reflective of increases and decreases in consumer activity in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5987">As the plastic bag levy does not apply to reusable bags, my Department does not have information regarding per capita usage of such bags.  However, data from the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System are used to measure the impact of certain anti-litter measures such as the plastic bag levy.  This demonstrates that plastic bags accounted for approximately 5% of litter arisings prior to the introduction of the levy while the most recent survey data (2010) show that plastic bags, including reusable bags, constitute approximately 0.25% of litter pollution nationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_6030">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published an advice note on Source Protection and Catchment Management to protect Groundwater Supplies in August 2011.  This note provides an outline of the key groundwater protection policies, guidance and related legislation that water services authorities should have regard to when developing measures to protect groundwater used for drinking water.  Groundwater Protection Plans have been prepared on a county by county basis by the Geological Survey of Ireland for most local authorities; there are four Groundwater Protection Plans outstanding but these will be completed by the end of this year.  These plans are incorporated by local authorities into County Development Plans and are used to assist in the assessment of the potential impact of development on groundwater.</p>
            <p eId="para_6031">The EPA is responsible for carrying out Ireland's national groundwater monitoring programme.  The programme consists of a network of some 350 monitoring points.  The network has been designed to be representative of the variations in hydrogeology and anthropogenic pressures across a groundwater body and is subject to ongoing review as circumstances change.  Threshold values for mandatory substances under the Priority and Dangerous Substances Directives have been established in the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 and they apply to all groundwater bodies nationally.  In relation to the specific areas mentioned in the question, I understand the EPA will be involved in commissioning a scientific study into hydraulic fracturing which will include baseline monitoring of groundwater in relevant areas.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the EPA are developing the scope for this study.  The European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 transpose key elements of the Water Framework Directive  and the Groundwater Directive and establish clear environmental objectives to be achieved in groundwater bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_6032">In accordance with the Groundwater Regulations, public authorities including the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, insofar as their functions allow, must, inter alia, take all reasonable steps to prevent or limit the input of pollutants into groundwater and prevent the deterioration of the status of all groundwater bodies.  The Regulations prohibit the direct discharge of any pollutants into groundwater.  Certain categories of discharges may be permitted subject to a requirement for prior authorisation provided such discharges, and the conditions imposed, do not compromise the achievement of the environmental objectives established for the body of groundwater into which the discharge is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_6033">Discharge authorisations are required by the Regulations to prohibit the input of hazardous substances and limit the input of non-hazardous substances into groundwater.  The EPA is responsible for identifying and publishing a list of pollutants which it considers to be hazardous or non-hazardous based on technical criteria.  This list was first published in December 2010 as part of the report Classification of Hazardous and non-Hazardous Substances in Groundwater and is available to download from the EPA website.  The list is periodically reviewed by the EPA where it considers this to be necessary for the purpose of protecting groundwater.</p>
            <p eId="para_6034">As regards the construction and use of pit storage sites and the regulation of and standards for the operation of well-heads, overall responsibility for policy and regulation of hydraulic fracturing is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Minister is committed to obtaining further and more detailed scientific advice on hydraulic fracturing.  I understand that until the results of the study to be commissioned by the EPA are available and have been considered, he will not make any decision on any application proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing.</p>

            <p eId="para_6038">This is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health, in the first instance.  While my Department does not fund mainstream health initiatives it is, however, responsible for a range of programmes which support communities, including the Local and Community Development Programme  which tackles poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities; the RAPID Programme (Revitalising Areas through Planning Investment and Development) which tackles the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion in designated areas; and the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 which implements measures to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitates the diversification of the rural economy.  These Programmes do not specifically deal with health issues, but they have a role in addressing community well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_6039">Although healthcare activities are not eligible for funding under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013, the RDP has elements that support the achievement of a healthy lifestyle, for example community gyms.  Such funding is provided in a broader,  quality-of-life context and is not targeted at specific aspects of healthcare.  In addition, it is widely recognised that a lack of adequate facilities, directly or indirectly related to health, is a major contributor to disadvantage in RAPID areas.  Under the RAPID Programme, my Department has, in the past, co-funded a number of health projects in RAPID areas with the Department of Health and the HSE.  Projects funded under the scheme covered a wide range of community health facilities, including premises for youth facilities, play areas for special needs playgroups, improvements to womens' refuges and services and facilities for older people to enhance and provide facilities that would enable older people to live independent lives.  The RAPID budget for my Department for 2012 is fully committed to existing projects and our priority is to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to meet existing legal contractual commitments.</p>

            <p eId="para_6041">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_6042">The Act provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.  The exemptions are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6043">Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6046">Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6047">Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6048">Residential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).</p>
            <p eId="para_6049">The waivers which apply concern:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6050">Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6051">Owners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.</p>
            <p eId="para_6052">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  If a person does not inhabit a property as his or her sole or main residence, he or she will also be liable for this €200 charge on the property concerned unless otherwise exempt.</p>
            <p eId="para_6053">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 does not provide for waivers and instead places collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities.  I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of this care and management provision in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  In such cases, the guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  I also intend to issue guidance shortly to local authorities on hardship in the context of the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_6071">In relation to non-compliance discovered by a local authority enforcement officer, a warning letter is issued and a follow up inspection is carried out.  If the retailer is still non-compliant, the next step would be for the local authority to pursue legal action.  The Revenue Commissioners will also be contacted if it is suspected that the non-compliance has been ongoing, resulting in a significant amount of levy not having been collected.  Statistics collected by the Environmental Protection Agency on local authority enforcement activities indicate that approximately 800 plastic bag levy inspections were carried out by local authorities in 2010.  However, my Department does not have information regarding the number of inspections specifically targeting temporary retail settings such as weekend markets.</p>

On receipt of the Panel's report I will give careful consideration to any recommendations it may contain in relation to the adequacy of existing testing regimes for quarries and the need for revised standards or testing requirements  in relation to the end use of aggregates.  A strong statutory framework for the regulation of construction activity already exists under the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007 and relevant European standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6082">The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of buildings, including houses and extensions.  Related Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) provide technical guidance on how compliance with the regulations can be achieved in practice.  Work carried out in accordance with the guidance provided in the TGDs is considered<i>prima facie </i>evidence of compliance with the Building Regulations.  The key requirements relevant to the use of hardcore material for buildings are set out in Part C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) and Part D (Materials and Workmanship) of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.  The Building Regulations and related TGDs are subject to on-going review.</p>
            <p eId="para_6083">The Construction Products Directive provides for a system of harmonised technical specifications for construction products.  There is a suite of European Standards and Guidance Documents for the use of aggregates including their use in concrete, bituminous mixtures, mortar etc.  The standards and guidance documents set out testing requirements for the aggregates depending on their end use.  Quarries are required to have in place a testing regime to ensure compliance with the requisite standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_6084">IS EN 13242:2002 is a harmonised European Product Standard for Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction.  IS EN 13242:2002 was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NASI) in 2002 and came into effect in January, 2003.  Standard Recommendation (SR) 21, published by NSAI in 2004, provides guidance on the use of IS EN 13242:2002.  It was revised in 2007 to give additional specific guidance on reducing the risk of reactive forms of pyrite being present in material fill for use under concrete floors in dwellings and buildings.</p>

            <p eId="para_6086">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_6087">Section 10 of the Act specifically provides that a receipt shall issue on payment of the charge.  Receipts are issued by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), which administers the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  When the online system is used for payment, a receipt issues automatically.  When a payment is made by post, a receipt issues on processing of that payment.  I understand from data provided by the LGMA that, as of 30 May 2012, 28,800 postal applications received had yet to be processed.  Every effort is being made by the LGMA to clear this postal backlog as soon as possible.</p>

To date, 31 practically trained persons have been deemed eligible for inclusion on the register of architects.  Of these, six underwent the technical assessment process and 25 underwent the register admission examination.

            <p eId="para_6124">Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 outlines the obligations on public service bodies to employ people with disabilities.  There are three interlinked requirements.  Firstly public bodies must, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities.  Secondly, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, at least 3% of their employees must be people with disabilities.  Finally on an annual basis public bodies must report to the statutory Monitoring Committee and to the Minister of their parent Department on the number of people with disabilities in their employment and the measures they are taking to support them in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6125">A Monitoring Committee was established in 2007 to monitor compliance by local authorities and public bodies under the remit of my Department with Part 5 of the Disability Act.  The Committee reviews employment targets to determine levels of compliance with the Government's 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities and reports each year in relation to compliance by the local authorities and public bodies under the aegis of my Department to the National Disability Authority (NDA) and to me.</p>

Implementation of the recommendations is under way.  The plan contains a list of actions arising from the review, some of which are a matter for my Department and others which are the responsibility of the EPA and others.  I have prioritised a large number of actions for implementation in 2012, while others will be considered over a longer period as they will require detailed consultation and possibly primary legislation.

            <p eId="para_6132">Firstly I acknowledge the distressing and stressful situations which individuals face when building works are not completed to the required acceptable standard.  The Building Control Act 1990 clearly places responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder/developer who carries out the works.  The Building Regulations set out the legally enforceable minimum standards which a new building must achieve.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the 37 local Building Control Authorities who have strong powers to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance or to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements within a period of five years from the date the building has been completed.  Homeowners should be advised to report any concerns about non-compliance with the Building Regulations to the local Building Control Authority, in this case Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_6133">There is no mention in the details supplied as to whether the builder/developer was a member of any structural guarantee warranty/scheme, such as that provided by HomeBond, and this should be ascertained and pursued if relevant.  Remediation of defects is a matter between the parties concerned, the owner and the builder/developer and their insurers.  If satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation, the option of seeking civil legal remedy may be considered.  It is noted that the homeowner in question has already been in contact with a solicitor and is therefore already receiving professional advice in relation to the options available having regard to the particular circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_6137">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, set out the legislation underpinning the household charge and the charge on non-principal private residences respectively.  Both the household charge and the charge on non-principal private residences are on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the relevant liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay either charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_6138">The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 30 May 2012, a total of 916,214 property declarations has been processed by the household charge bureau.  A total of 899,121 registered for payment of the charge, equating to some €90.3m.  A total of 17,093 residential properties have been registered for a waiver from payment of the charge.  In addition, an estimated 28,800 postal declarations have been received in the household charge bureau, which have yet to be processed; these equate to a further €2.88m.  This gives a total number of 945,014 declarations made equating to over €93m.</p>

            <p eId="para_6178">Decisions on eligibility of households for social housing support and the allocation of that support are solely a matter for housing authorities.  Regulation 22 of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that an applicant household for long-term social housing support is ineligible for such support if a household member owns alternative accommodation that could reasonably be expected to be used to meet its housing need, either by occupying it or by selling it and using the proceeds to secure suitable accommodation.  For this reason, if either member of a separated couple applies, housing authorities require evidence of legal separation or divorce before considering a household's eligibility for long-term social housing support, as the separation agreement will provide certainty regarding property ownership.</p>
            <p eId="para_6179">My Department and the Housing Agency have provided guidance on these provisions to housing authorities.  I acknowledge, however, that situations may exceptionally arise that may not be easily dealt with under the current Regulations.  My Department is currently reviewing the social housing assessment provisions and will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities to address difficult and complex cases which may present to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_6194">I propose to take Questions Nos. 626 and 627 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6195">The Government is acutely conscious of the difficulties many households are facing in terms of mortgage arrears. Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as they consider equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_6196">In addition, my Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010. That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank's first statutory<i>Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears</i> to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_6197">To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_6198">This guidance will issue shortly and will include a common Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy. This will provide for the options available to distressed borrowers from private lenders to continue to be made available to distressed local authority borrowers also.</p>

            <p eId="para_6202">Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) classifies items such as bottles, drink cans and plastic containers as packaging.  The Packaging Directive is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_6203">Under the Directive, Ireland's requirement to achieve a 60% recovery rate for packaging waste in 2011 has already been exceeded and, in 2010, a recovery rate of 74% was achieved.  The material-specific recycling targets of 60% for glass, 50% for metals and 22.5% for plastics had also been achieved by 2010, with recycling rates of 78%, 63% and 39% respectively, recorded.</p>
            <p eId="para_6204">The<i>Programme for Government</i> contains a commitment to drive a waste reduction programme as part of the overall policy in the area of sustainable waste management.  One of the possible elements of this waste reduction strategy, which is contained in the Programme, is the introduction of a levy on packaging.</p>
            <p eId="para_6205">My Department commenced a process of consultation with industry, other stakeholders and the public on a possible levy on packaging to obtain the overall view of stakeholders on the broad subject of a packaging levy in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_6206">The main issues examined in this initial consultation were as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6207">The overall views of stakeholders on a packaging levy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6208">How a packaging levy might be operated;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6210">How a possible packaging levy might be structured in order to contribute to a reduction in packaging waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_6211">Following on from this consultation I have commenced a<i>Review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) Model in Ireland</i> which will build on the initial levy consultation and will examine other relevant issues in the packaging area, such as container deposit and refund schemes.  The aim of the review is to identify any changes to PRI policy which are required to ensure that Ireland is in a position to meet more challenging waste recovery and recycling targets in the future in the most cost-effective manner possible and to inform the policy development process which is now underway and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6212">In connection with a possible packaging levy, the review will include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6213">(i) an economic analysis of the possible affects of a packaging levy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6214">(ii) options on how a possible packaging levy might operate;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6215">(iii) possible alternatives to a packaging levy which would yield corresponding reductions in packaging;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6216">(iv) how might a packaging levy work in tandem and affect the operation of the compliance schemes; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6217">(v) an examination of initiatives such as deposit and refund and reverse vending either as stand alone options or in tandem with a packaging levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_6218">It is my view that economic decisions should only be taken when they have been placed in an environmental context, including the potential impact of such economic decisions on littering, and the review will inform my approach to deliver the best possible results for Ireland and our environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_6235">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_6236">The Act provides at section 2(2)(<i>d</i>) that buildings wholly used as dwellings and in respect of which local authority rates are payable are exempt from the charge.  A dwelling that forms part of a mixed hereditament within the meaning of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1978 is specifically excluded from this exemption.</p>

            <p eId="para_6245">It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_6246">The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6247">One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_6348">The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended, is an independent agency under the remit of my Department, responsible for the regulation and licensing of the private security industry.  The licensing of installers of security equipment encompassing intruder alarm, CCTV and access control systems is one such activity covered by the 2004 legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6349">I recently consented to the making of regulations, by the PSA, to extend licensing to contractors providing security services installing CCTV and access control systems.  In accordance with these regulations, from 1 October 2012, all existing contractors providing licensable CCTV and access control services must be in possession of the appropriate licence(s) or have an application lodged with the authority. The regulations also provide for the licensing of contractors who maintain intruder alarms systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_6350">As with other activities licensed by the authority, the validity of licenses will be based upon continued certified compliance with the required standards. The standard required for the access control sector is SR 40:2005 — an Irish Standard Recommendation for electronic security services. For CCTV, both the SR 40 standard and PSA 2006:12  are required, the latter being the Authority's requirements for CCTV installation. The Authority has also specified standards for contractors who maintain intruder alarms.</p>
            <p eId="para_6351">As a measure to alleviate the cost of the introduction of licensing to these new sectors, existing licensed intruder alarm installers will be able to add the CCTV and access control sectors to their existing licence at no additional cost. Furthermore, in terms of compliance costs, existing licence holders will be allowed to synchronise the timing of their standard certification audits for the new sectors with their existing intruder alarm auditing arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6352">I am informed by the authority that the extension of its licensing to these sectors has been in preparation for a considerable time and has involved consultation with the industry stakeholders. This extension of licensing, as outlined, marks the completion of the authority's licensing for the electronic security sector.</p>

The Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended, sets out the activities in the private security industry which are, or will be, subject to licensing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6355">Licensing is being introduced on a phased basis by the Authority, who currently licence contractors in the Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises), Security Guard (Static), Security Guard (Monitoring Centre), Installer (Intruder Alarm) and Cash In Transit sectors. Individuals working in the Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) and Security Guard (Static) sectors, whether employed by a licensed contractor or directly by a business as in house security personnel, also require a licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6356">Last month, I consented to the making of Regulations by the PSA to extend licensing, from 1st October 2012, to contractors installing CCTV and Access Control systems.  This completes the Authority's licensing of contractors in the electronic security sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6357">I am informed by the Authority that it is currently planning to introduce the licensing of certain individuals working in the Cash In Transit sector later on this year, as well as the licensing of contractors in the CCTV Monitoring and Event Security sectors in 2013. It is not possible to give a precise date, at this stage, for the regulation of the remaining sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_6379">The person concerned arrived in the State in June 2005 on a work visa and was permitted to remain in the State until September 2005. After the expiration of his permission, he remained in the State illegally until he applied for asylum on 10 January 2008. Later that month,  he was informed that the Refugee Applications Commissioner was recommending that he not be declared a refugee. He appealed this decision but subsequently withdrew his appeal in May 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6380">In August 2008 he was informed that the Minister was refusing his refugee status and was proposing to deport him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_6381">Following consideration of his case under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, a Deportation Order was made by the Minister on 12 February 2009 in respect of the person concerned. His legal representatives lodged papers applying for a judicial review of this decision in April 2009. However, the Court dismissed his application.</p>
            <p eId="para_6382">Representations were received in October 2011 on behalf of the person concerned requesting that the Deportation Order be revoked on the basis of the person's medical condition. Following consideration of his case under Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), it was determined that there were no exceptional circumstances that would be a breach of Article 3 or 8 of the ECHR.</p>
            <p eId="para_6383">The making of the Deportation Order placed a legal requirement on the person concerned to remove himself from the State.

            <p eId="para_6386">It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the particular circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of any person of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid and the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The Supreme Court judgment in the 1976 case State (Healy) v. Donoghue established that an accused person has, in certain circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a constitutional right to legal aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_6387">Under the Act, the decision to grant free legal aid is a matter for each court.  However, an applicant may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.  The Act also provides for certain sanctions in cases where an applicant knowingly makes a false statement or false representation for the purpose of obtaining free legal aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_6388">A Bill is currently being drafted to update the legislation governing criminal legal aid which dates from 1962.  In that context, a range of matters are being considered including provisions on eligibility for criminal legal aid, criteria for the determination of the means of applicants and recouping of monies where appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_6390">The Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 provided for the establishment of the "Green Card" employment permit for occupations where high level strategic skills shortages exist.  This Green Card Scheme replaces the work visa/work authorisation scheme which has been discontinued.  The Deputy will be aware that the issuing of Green Cards and employment permits to non-EEA nationals is, along with labour market policy generally, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6391">A person who has obtained a Green Card permit will then have little difficulty in obtaining an Irish visa if they are coming from a visa required country such as China.</p>
            <p eId="para_6392">In addition to the opportunities available to non-EEA migrants to avail of a "Green Card" employment permit the Government this year approved two new schemes, proposed by myself, which are designed to stimulate investment and enterprise in Ireland by suitably qualified foreign nationals.  The Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start up Entrepreneur Programme were formally launched on 30 March and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has been open to accept applications since 16 April.  The Programmes capitalise on the opportunities that exist for our immigration system to tap into the entrepreneurial capacity of current and future migrants and also to bring investment into Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_6394">I am of course concerned at the increase in number of burglaries in 2011, while noting that for most crime groups, including robbery, the most recent statistics indicate a decline in recorded crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_6395">All crime trends are monitored closely by Garda management, with intelligence-led initiatives put in place to target burglary and other criminality. The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures as part of a new operation aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_6396">These measures are encompassed in<i>Operation Fiacla</i>, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda Region in support of <i>Operation Fiacla</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_6397">In terms of prevention, the National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) and Crime Prevention Officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary. These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and advise on ways to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime. The NCPU has designed a number of crime prevention advice leaflets including advice on home security and burglary prevention through a step by step checklist. These leaflets and the checklist are available on the Garda website<i>www.garda.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_6398">During 2012, the national Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign will continue to highlight key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety. The first campaign was launched last month by the Garda Commissioner and the second will take place in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6399">In addition, the Crime Victims Helpline, to which the Deputy refers, is funded by my Department through the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and acts as a central point of contact for all victims of crime. The Helpline is a confidential national helpline which offers support and an initial contact point for victims and their families. It also provides them with information on other organisations that offer victim services and information on all aspects of the criminal justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_6400">Insofar as the closure of Garda stations is concerned, when preparing the Policing Plan for 2011 the Garda Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda station in their area. It must be stressed that the key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings. In this context, the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the frontline if a particular station no longer had to be staffed and maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_6401">I am conscious of the deep distress which burglary can cause to householders and of the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities and therefore welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted and strategic approach to confronting those who are engaging in this form of criminality.</p>

            <p eId="para_6404">In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, it is not possible to give a definitive answer because each student's options can depend on their immigration history (for instance the number of years they have been in Ireland and the courses they have pursued).  It will be necessary for my officials to look in more detail at what course was pursued by this person before a decision can be made with regard to extending her student permission in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_6405">I have been informed that an application was received in General Immigration Division on 10 April 2012 from the person mentioned by the Deputy requesting permission to remain in the State as the Defacto partner of an Irish citizen.

            <p eId="para_6415">I think it is important to point out that even if a person was granted long term residence in advance of his trip, he would still be required to obtain a re-entry visa and to pay the necessary fees for that visa on top of the €500 he would be required to pay for long-term residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6416">An application for long term residency generally takes about six months to process.  For instance, if a person submitted a valid application in May 2012, that application should be finalised by the end of November 2012.

            <p eId="para_6419">As the Deputy is aware, the Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. Practice and procedure relating to the operation of the courts is determined either by relevant legislation or by Rules of Court defined by the Rules Committees of the various court jurisdictions.  Any person being a party to civil proceedings would be entitled to inspect an order made in the case.  In addition, any person being a party may, upon payment of an appropriate fee, obtain a copy of any order made by the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_6420">Court offices also maintain a number of registers which are open to inspection by the public on payment of an appropriate fee. Examples include the Judgments Register maintained in the Central Office of the High Court and the Licensing Register in the District Court.  In addition, the result of every High Court application, including the nature of the order made, can be viewed on-line for all cases, other than those required by law to be heard otherwise than in public e.g. family law cases.</p>

          if he is satisfied that An Garda Síochána is discharging its duty to take proper heed or proper notice of concerns expressed in the courts as to abuse of the summary summons or special summons process by the filing of affidavits containing untrue or unfounded averments of fact and law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6422">The summary summons procedure is one whereby civil proceedings can be commenced in the High Court and those proceedings are heard on affidavit without pleadings and with or without oral evidence.  The special summons procedure is one that may be adopted where there is no other procedure prescribed by the Rules of the Superior Courts and the proceeding is one which is required or authorised by law.</p>
            <p eId="para_6423">Where people knowingly file affidavits containing falsehoods they may be guilty of committing the offence of perjury.  One of the functions of the Garda Síochána is to bring criminals to justice by detecting and investigating alleged crimes and if the Deputy is aware of any particular instance where the offence of perjury may have been committed he should bring this to the attention of the Garda authorities so that the matter can be investigated.</p>

            <p eId="para_6425">I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in January, 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_6426">The application is at an advanced stage of processing and the person concerned will be informed of the outcome in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_6427">It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_6428">As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6429">Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>

            <p eId="para_6431">The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in the matter. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_6432">Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have been informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Moville Garda station on 30 April 2009 and on 30 April 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 8 and 6 respectively. Moville Garda Station forms part of the Buncrana Garda District in the Donegal Garda Division. The personnel strength of Buncrana Garda District and Donegal Garda Division on 30 April 2012 was 73 and 434 respectively. There are also 24 Garda Reserves and 29 Civilians attached to the Donegal Garda Division. These resources are augmented, when appropriate, by Gardaí from national units.  Members of the Garda Síochána may retire at any time once they have reached 50 years of age and have 30 years of service and they must retire at 60 years of age. One member attached to Moville has applied to retire from An Garda Síochána before December, 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_6433">Any changes in the opening or closing of Garda stations must be highlighted by the Commissioner in his annual policing plan which is submitted to me before November of each year.</p>

The amendments permit the Property Registration Authority (PRA) to register such easements without a court order where there is no disagreement between the parties concerned. Rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2011 (S.I. No. 559 of 2011).</p>

Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is ongoing at my Department including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and the amendments will, as I have previously explained, be made available in advance of Committee Stage as will the relevant Regulatory Impact Analysis.

The total number of registrations on student immigration permission was 32,876 in 2006; 39,720 in 2007; 44,942 in 2008; 45,518 in 2009; 45,460 in 2010; and 46,509 in 2011. It should be noted that these figures cover both existing permissions carried over from the previous year.  Students on visits of less than 90 days, however, are not included as such persons are not required to register.</p>
            <p eId="para_6537">At present, it is not possible to accurately differentiate between the different education sectors and levels. The Deputy will be aware that the new immigration regime for full-time non-EEA students was introduced in January 2011 and that before this date, the Internationalisation Register of courses was not categorised into Degree courses and Language or Non-Degree Courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_6538">However, an analysis of the student records carried out in March 2012 provides a breakdown of non-EEA students with reference to the type of course students are registered as attending.  Approximately 28% of students are undertaking English language courses, 20% non-degree programmes; and 40% degree programmes. The remaining 11% includes students at secondary level, students on Graduate Schemes and those on Timed Out student permission.</p>

Any employment which exceeds these limits will be in breach of employment permits legislation.

            <p eId="para_6555">The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 was presented to the Seanad on 2 May 2012, and will be debated at Second Stage on 13 June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_6556">The purpose of the Bill is to assist with the rehabilitation of offenders and to remove some of the obstacles that they face when seeking to access employment. It allows offenders to withhold details of certain qualifying convictions once certain conditions have been met and an appropriate conviction-free period has elapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6557">The Bill provides for a self-administered system of non-disclosure that excludes three categories of sentence:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6558">a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more (irrespective of whether the sentence is suspended in whole or in part);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6559">a sentence for an offence that is reserved to be tried by the Central Criminal Court; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6560">a sentence imposed in respect of a sexual offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6561">In arriving at the range and type of sentences that should be covered by the Bill, I had to balance the legitimate aim of ensuring that the measure is of benefit to those offenders who want to move on and leave their pasts behind, with the need to ensure that those convicted of serious offences should not benefit from the Bill.  In drawing the line at a sentence of 12 months, compared to the 6 months recommended in the Law Reform Commission Report, I believe that this balance has been largely achieved, and while I will be open to considering amendments that improve the Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas, these will have to respect the core principles of the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_6604">The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on the provision of vocational training and educational activities for prisoners.  Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which help secure employment on release.</p>
            <p eId="para_6605">With regard to employability and placement programmes, the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO), formerly known as Business in the Community Ireland (BITC), is the main provider of support in this area. Since 2007, another IASIO programme, the GATE Service, has been operating in six institutions; Mountjoy, Dóchas, St. Patrick's Institution, the Training Unit, Midlands and Portlaoise Prisons.  The service was introduced to Wheatfield Prison in 2011. Funded by the Irish Prison Service, four GATE Service Training and Employment Officers work on a full-time basis in the prisons concerned and provide a training, education and employment placement service.</p>
            <p eId="para_6606">IASIO personnel interact with all national and local services to maximise the opportunities for prisoners on release from prison.  At national level, the Gate and Linkage Services, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and FÁS have agreed a protocol to facilitate the smooth and effective referral of prisoners and ex-prisoners to FÁS courses and their successful completion of the identified programme. IASIO's social inclusion programmes also interact with the Department of Social Protection, in particular with the Jobs Facilitators, and, where appropriate, with the Community Welfare Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6607">Training and Employment Officers working with the Gate or Linkage Services also interact with local partnerships to access the full range of services that may be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_6608">The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Prison Service's Three Year Strategic Plan with a clear commitment to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  The Irish Prison Service will engage with other statutory agencies, including the Probation Service, and the community and voluntary sector to enhance sentence management from pre to post imprisonment in a way which will facilitate improved prisoner outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_6650">The Legal Aid Board is a statutory, independent body in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  The issue raised by the Deputy is a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.  I am informed by the Board that the maximum waiting time for an initial appointment with a solicitor in the Castlebar law centre at the end of April 2012 was 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_6651">I can further inform the Deputy that, as set out in a number of recent replies to Deputies, there has been a significant increase in demand for legal services provided by the Board in recent years.  However, a number of measures have been taken to alleviate the impact of the increased demand.<i>  </i>  Firstly, I have ensured that the Board’s grant-in-aid for general civil matters, which accounts for the vast majority of its funding, has effectively been maintained for 2012 at its 2011 level.  I have also now incorporated the grant for asylum services into the grant-in-aid which should give the Board greater flexibility in using its resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6652">Secondly, as indicated in recent replies to Deputies,  there are a number of additional measures, taken or being taken, which I believe will have a positive impact on persons seeking services from the Board:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6653">The Board has outsourced to private solicitors significantly more work in recent years than it did a number of years ago.  There is of course a budgetary constraint on what can be referred and it is not possible to accommodate all of the additional demand through private referral;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6654">As of 1 November 2011, the Board assumed responsibility for the Family Mediation Service (following the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011).  The Board is currently reviewing the operation of the State funded mediation service with a view to achieving synergies with its legal services and better options in terms of resolving family disputes;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6655">The arrangements on foot of which barristers are retained have been in place since 1998 and are currently under review.  There will be a level of restructuring of the current arrangements;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6656">The Board is working with individual law centres with a view to trying to deliver greater efficiencies in a number of its centres.  It is assisted in this regard by the preparation of a Value for Money Review Report prepared by my Department and the Department of Finance (now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform); and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6657">The Board has commenced piloting a "triage" service.  The objective of the pilot is to ensure that every applicant for services gets to see a solicitor for the purpose of getting early legal advice within a period of one month.  It is recognised that those seeking further services will experience a wait, however it is anticipated that an early consultation will benefit the client in terms of signposting actions the client can take themselves and signposting other support service.  The pilot has commenced in five of the Board's law centres — Sligo, Nenagh, Cavan, Wicklow and Athlone.  It is anticipated that the pilot will commence in the remaining centres shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_6659">The "Turn off the Red Light" campaign calls on the Government to introduce legislation criminalising the purchase of sexual services, based on the legislative model in Sweden for combating prostitution.</p>

            <p eId="para_6661">The Deputy will appreciate that until the consultation exercise and review are completed, it would not be proper to commit to any particular legislative approach. There are differing and genuinely held views on the appropriate legislative response to prostitution. The consultation process must be and be seen to be objective, transparent, open-minded and fair. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_6667">The matters to which the Deputy refers are covered by the Government's proposals introduced in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which deals with the reform of the legal sector and of legal costs. The Bill completed Second Stage in the Dáil on 23 February and I very much appreciate the considered contribution made by Deputy O'Donovan to the Second Stage debate in support of the Bill's reform agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_6668">That agenda is laid out in the Government's commitment under the Programme for National Recovery 2011-2011 to "establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints".  The Legal Services Regulation Bill provides the statutory framework for meeting all of these commitments. By the same token, the Bill supports the urgent objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery contained in the EU/IMF/ECB Memorandum of Understanding while taking account of the relevant recommendations for reform made by the Legal Costs Working Group and by the Competition Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_6669">The Legal Services Regulation Bill has 3 pillars of reform—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6670">a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both   solicitors and barristers supported by appropriate statutory powers and objectives. The Authority will have a lay majority and a lay chair;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6671">an independent complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct. This will provide a first port of call for the public independent of the professional bodies. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both professions which will be independent of both the new Regulatory Authority and the professional bodies.  In response to the Deputy's query I can confirm that Section 2 of the Bill, as it currently stands, defines an admissible complaint as a complaint which is received by the Authority not later than 3 years after the occurrence of the act or omission which it is alleged constitutes misconduct — unless, for example, it relates to fraud or dishonesty by a legal practitioner;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6672">an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Office of the Taxing-Master which will be conferred with enhanced transparency in its functions. The determination of disputed legal costs by the Adjudicator is being bolstered by new Legal Costs Principles, the publication of the Adjudicator's decisions and the issue of legal costs guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_6673">In my comprehensive statement to the Annual Conference of the Law Society on the 14 of April I have elaborated on the scope of the amendments to the Bill that are under consideration. The full text of the statement is available on the Department website,<i>www.justice.ie</i>, for ease of reference. This approach to the development of the Bill reflects the substantial progress already made in realising the desired balance between the Government’s stated policy objective of independent regulation and the independence of the legal professions to the benefit of all concerned.  Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is ongoing at my Department including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and the amendments will be made available in advance of Committee Stage along with the relevant Regulatory Impact Analysis. It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill should commence as soon as possible after the summer recess so that the Bill can be given the necessary consideration by Members and thereafter brought to Final Stage for timely enactment and implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6684">The purpose of the Bill is to replace, in updated form, section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 which was found to be repugnant to the Constitution by the Supreme Court because it allowed a person who was not independent of the investigation concerned to issue a search warrant in relation to a dwelling<i>(</i>Ali Charaf Damache<i> v. </i>The Director of Prosecutions, Ireland and the Attorney General;  23 February 2012).</p>
            <p eId="para_6685">The Bill will meet the requirement for independence by providing that an application for a warrant may be made to a District Court judge, or in circumstances of urgency requiring the immediate issue of a warrant that would render it impracticable to apply to a District Court judge, to a senior member of An Garda Síochána who is neither involved in, nor in charge of, the investigation concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_6691">I am advised by officials in the Irish Naturalisation Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy was first registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on the 3 April, 2007.  He was not registered with GNIB prior to April 2007 as there is no legal requirement to register under the age of 16.  He was granted a Stamp 2 student permission upon registering with GNIB.  This particular type of permission allows an individual to work up to 20 hours a week during term time and 40 hours a week in holiday time without the need for a work permit.  A Stamp 3 residency permission would not allow the person referred to by the Deputy any access to the employment market.</p>
            <p eId="para_6692">Generally a Non-EEA minor who reaches the age of 16 would attend to the GNIB and have an stamp placed in their passport in line with their activities in the State.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_6704">I refer the Deputy to my recent reply, appended below, to Parliamentary Question No. 72 of 8 May 2012:</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6705">Reply to PQ No. 72 of 8 May 2012</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6706">When I came into office just over a year ago one of my first objectives was to address the length of time taken to process applications for naturalisation and to significantly reduce the number of cases on hand. At that time there were over 22,000 cases on hand and applications were taking an average time of over two years to process and many were waiting 3 to 4 years. I regarded this as unacceptable.  In June 2011, I announced a series of measures to address this issue including improved application forms, which are currently available online with an associated online residence checker, re-engineering of processes that were a barrier to achieving maximum efficiency plus streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6707">Through these and other measures enormous progress has been made, notwithstanding a substantial increase in the volume of valid applications received in 2011, during which a total of 18,500 valid applications were received compared to 12,500 in 2010. In the period 9 March 2011 to 8 March this year, a total of 17,500 valid applications were determined. By contrast, in 2010, a decision was reached in just under 7,800 cases. So far this year I have made decisions on some 9,200 applications and I expect to have made a decision on a further 3,500 applications by the end of May and on around another 12,000 applications between June and the year end.  Thus this year will see approximately 24,000 cases dealt with, which represents a more than three fold increase in the number of cases dealt with over 2010 levels.  I think the House will agree that by any standards of reasonable measurement this represents a major achievement.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6708">I also undertook to get to the stage by the second quarter of this year, that in the generality of cases i.e. around 70%, that persons applying for a certificate of naturalisation will be given a decision on their application within six months.  In this regard, a major effort has and continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process applications. It is expected that the six month timeframe for the generality of new applications received from this month onwards will be achieved.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6709">Under the new Job-Bridge Programme announced by the Government a total of sixteen individuals have been engaged by the Citizenship Division of my Department to date. The primary purpose of the scheme is to provide work experience for those involved and to improve their prospects of getting back into the workforce.  I am advised that the scheme is extremely successful and mutually beneficial in addressing the backlog and enabling the individuals in question to gain good experience in the workplace.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6710">Last Summer I also decided to in introduce citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State.  This allows candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. To date, 47 such ceremonies have been held at which almost 11,000 candidates have become Irish citizens under the new procedures.  These ceremonies are an unqualified success.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_6711">The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  The primary aim over the past year has been to reduce the large volume of cases on hand as swiftly as possible and this has been achieved in the generality of cases.  I am also confident that significant inroads will also be made with the remaining cases by year end.  In such a fast moving environment where large volumes of cases are processed quickly, the calculation of averages for processing times has little meaning and the priority of the Immigration Service has been to deal with the cases on hand rather than divert resources to other activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_6723">Section 36 of the Prisons Act 2007, which was brought into operation on 1 May, 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use of mobile telecommunication devices. Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction or indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.  It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_6724">Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence-led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  Details of mobile seizures as requested are set out in the table below. It is important to note that not all of the phones were confiscated directly from prisoners but were instead retrieved at entry point or before they got to the prisoner population.  This is as a direct consequence of security measures currently in place including airport style scanners and x-ray machines, which are in operation at the entrances of all the relevant closed prisons.</p>

A review of the redress of wrongs process was a recommendation contained in the second report of the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG) and is being progressed on this basis. The IMG report included many recommendations to chart the way ahead in continuing to meet the demands for dignity and equality in the military workplace. The 2008 IMG report contains in excess of forty (40) specific recommendations and this is one of the last few recommendations remaining to be implemented.</p>

It is anticipated that the review will be significantly advanced by the year-end.</p>

The primary focus of the re-organisation is to free up the maximum number of military personnel from administrative and support tasks.

This task is a significant undertaking and there are a range of issues that must be considered. However, the primary focus will be the maintenance of operational outputs and capabilities.

            <p eId="para_6809">The Department is engaged in an ongoing capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces. The programme provides for new projects and the continuation of capital building work already underway.    An overall capital provision of €9m has been allocated to the Department for 2012. Some €2.8m of this overall amount has been allocated for IT hardware and associated licensing support costs and €6.2 million has been allocated for capital works projects at military installations.  A further €500k is also available for capital works projects as capital carryover from 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_6810">Approximately €2.7m of the 2012 capital works allocation is being expended on a range of capital building projects which were already in progress from 2011 and which are at various stages of completion across a number of military locations.  These include the installation of an Automated Marking System at the firing range at Kilworth Camp and the renovation of facilities for military personnel at Aiken Barracks, Dundalk.</p>
            <p eId="para_6811">The balance of the provision for capital works will facilitate new starts in 2012.  Principal new projects proposed for 2012 include the construction of a replacement Hangar at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and the provision of further Automated Marking facilities.  They also include the development of proposals for the upgrade of the Ammunition Depot Buildings at the Defence Forces Training Centre at the Curragh.</p>
            <p eId="para_6812">The Capital funding for 2012 is reduced from the previous year's allocation, following the trend of recent years, and this is reflected in the number of new start projects to be undertaken in the current year.</p>

To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Private Joyce.</p>

The size of the allocation is dependent on both the number of applications received and the availability of quota from the National Reserve. The allocations are made on the basis of recommendations received from an independent Assessment Panel, who objectively examine each of the applications submitted. The Panel take factors like past production records; length of restrictions and nature of disease into account when making  their recommendation.  Demand for this quota significantly exceeds  supply and this means that in general allocations are significantly less than that sought by the individuals concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_6829">The main purpose of this informal co-ordination group was to put in place structures, procedures and arrangements which would enable progressive delivery by Ireland, in a multi-year plan, of its obligations for compliance in respect to sea fisheries and aquaculture under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.  The arrangements or road map drawn up by this co-ordination group and approved by Ministers was laid before the EU Commission in the context of the European Court of Justice Judgement against Ireland in this matter. The informal co-ordination steering group put in place arrangements for the progressive collection of necessary benthic, ornithological and other data in relevant marine Natura sites, the progressive development of conservation objectives in those sites, the progressive completion of Appropriate Assessments and the establishment of fisheries Natura plans and other arrangements so as to enable a progressive role out of consent determination in line with the Natura obligations once all the requested preconditions are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_6830">The informal Steering Group was established a number of years ago and met very frequently at the point where it was establishing the structures, procedures and arrangements for delivering compliance with the obligations under the Natura Directives. The programmes and arrangements put in place under the Steering Group are now being implemented by the relevant Departments and Agencies who are and have been driving this process forward. There are regular inter-agency and interdepartmental contacts and meetings on specific issues arising. The primary functions of the informal Steering Committee in establishing the arrangements is to an extent met and the informal Steering Group last met on 26th of October 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_6831">There are now regular inter Agency and inter Departmental meetings and close operational contacts on specific aspects of this matter. For example, an all day meeting took in Galway on 23rd May on Aquaculture Natura related issues. That meeting was between the two Departments and their Agencies and discussed specific aquaculture licensing aspects arising from the Natura Directives. Further such meetings are anticipated.  In the event that broader difficulties or issues arise in the implementation of the arrangements put in place, or there is any other useful purpose which can be contributed to, the Steering Committee it can be re-convened at short notice whenever necessary.</p>

These options are now being considered by that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7011">In reviewing our accommodation needs my Department's overriding objective is the redeployment of staff so as to reintegrate business areas that have been split between different locations and, in so far as possible, to co-locate different business areas that have cross-over functions or can exploit any existing operational synergies from such co-location. This makes for much greater flexibility and efficiency if we use our own resources. In addition, significantly reducing the number of my Department's locations in Portlaoise will accrue substantial savings to the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_7015">The primary means of acquiring milk quota is through the Milk Quota Trading Scheme. The Trading Scheme is run twice annually in respect of each Co-op collection area. I expect to announce details of the first stage of the 2013/2014 Trading Scheme in the autumn, and this will be followed by a second stage, which I intend to announce in early 2013.

            <p eId="para_7016">The Scheme for the Allocation of Milk Quota to New Entrants, which I introduced in 2009, provides an opportunity for new entrants to dairying to acquire a milk quota. Under this scheme 50 successful applicants will each receive an allocation of 200,000 litres. My Department is currently processing applications to the fourth of five schemes. The final scheme will be announced in early 2013.  Other means by which milk quota may be acquired are through the purchase of land and quota on the open market, the purchase of quota only from a qualified relative or through the leasing of land and quota from a qualified relative.  Full details of all options referred to above can be obtained by contacting the Milk Quota Section in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_7018">Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.</p>
            <p eId="para_7019">A Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established in 1993/94 comprising of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interest of animal welfare both for hares and greyhounds alike.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976,  has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares.</p>

            <p eId="para_7023">The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 and Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota availed of the sugar restructuring scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Post reform production is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar.</p>
            <p eId="para_7024">I have strongly supported the full abolition of sugar quotas from September 2015 as part of the CAP reform discussions which are currently underway in the Council of Ministers, and which, if agreed, would replace the existing quota regime. I also raised the issue with Commissioner Ciolos during his visit to Ireland in January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_7025">In 2011 I met with two separate groups who have conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility here. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. I also further suggested to both groups the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_7033">In Member States, like Ireland, who adopted the Historical model for implementing the Single Payment Scheme, applicants are obliged to declare one eligible hectare of land for each payment entitlement held.  The number of payment entitlements held is equal to the average number of hectares of eligible land declared during the 2000-2002 reference period.</p>
            <p eId="para_7034">Farmers in Member States who are applying the Historical Model would have encountered difficulties if, in 2005 and subsequent years, they were not farming the same number of hectares that they had during the reference period.  It was for this reason that the concept of Consolidation of Entitlements was introduced under Article 7 of Commission Regulation 795/2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_7035">Farmers, who, for specific reasons, were farming less lands in 2005 or in subsequent years than the average number of hectares farmed during the reference period may apply to consolidate their entitlements.  In Ireland the following categories of farmers were deemed eligible to participate in the programme:</p>
            <p eId="para_7036">Farmers, who were farming a reduced number of hectares when compared to the reference period for one of the following reasons;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7037">(i) the sale of lands under a Compulsory Purchase Order to a Public Authority for non-agricultural purposes;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7038">(ii) the afforestation of lands (no longer applicable to forestry planted from 1 January 2009)</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7039">(iii) the loss of leased/rented land on expiry of a lease or rental agreement</p>
            <p eId="para_7040">In all cases applicants for consolidation must retain at least 50% of the average number of hectares declared during the reference period.</p>
            <p eId="para_7041">Applicants are entitled to apply for consolidation in more than one year provided all the conditions are met, however, land farmed during the reference period and not available when the applicant previously consolidated cannot be used again as a reason to further consolidate. The closing date for receipt of applications under the Consolidation measure of the 2012 Single Payment Scheme was 15th   May 2012.  My Department to date has received a total of 1,357 applications in respect of the 2012 Scheme year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7630">Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.</p>
            <p eId="para_7631">The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976,  has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares.</p>
            <p eId="para_7632">The ICC has also informed me that 98.32% of hares netted for coursing in the past season were released back to the wild and that injury to hares by muzzled greyhounds is a very rare occurrence. The ICC has a robust system of regulation in place to underpin the maintenance of standards in the sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_7633">Bord na gCon has demonstrated its commitment to animal  welfare and in this regard has a number of initiatives in place to ensure consistent and appropriate welfare standards are met. A Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established in 1993/94 comprising of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interest of animal welfare both for hares and greyhounds alike.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7647">My Department has reviewed my reply to Parliamentary Question 168 in light of the attached correspondence.</p>
            <p eId="para_7648">With regard to the Brucellosis test in May 1977, the information available to my Department is that 26 cows were tested and 3 cows were disclosed as reactor on foot of this test. However, the herd owner refused to accept a restriction notice issued by my Department under the Brucellosis Order and no animals were removed as reactor until December 1977. According to the Department's files, compensation amounting to £17,000 was paid to the herd owner in May 1978 in respect of reactors removed between October 1977 and March 1978.</p>
            <p eId="para_7649">With regard to the number of cattle in the herd of the herd owner in question, the Department has had considerable difficulty in establishing the precise number of cows in his herd because of the illegal movement of animals into and out of the herd during the period in question and the failure of the herd owner to present all of his animals at any one test, with the exception of the test carried out on 30 September 1978, when he presented 107 animals for test. The Department's reference to 107 animals as constituting his herd merely refers to the number of animals in his herd which were presented for the last test carried out on his herd on 30 September 1978 before it was depopulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_7650">I would like to emphasise that these events happened about 34 years ago and were disposed of by the Courts in 1982. Approximately €66,000 was paid as compensation to the herd owner in respect of disease breakdowns in his herd during the period 1977 and 1978. He also received considerable sums of money from meat factories for the meat value of the cattle, including reactors, in his herd during that period. Any further claim for compensation he is now making is long since statute barred, which Statute the Department fully relies on.  Finally, I should point out that the State was awarded costs amounting to approximately €51,400 against the person in question arising from his unsuccessful High Court challenge in 1998 against the Department's decision to withdraw his herd number in November 1978.  The person has continually refused to pay these costs.   The Chief State Solicitors Office is currently seeking to recover these costs from him on behalf of the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_7676">The horticulture industry, including non-food crops and potatoes, was valued at approximately €400 million in 2011 or 6.4% of total agricultural output.</p>
            <p eId="para_7677">Whilst there are no detailed statistics of the number of persons employed in horticulture, the industry is labour intensive and it is estimated that as many as 8,500 are employed across the food and non-food areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7678">The general state of the economy and the availability of credit from banks are the two main factors impacting on the industry.   As horticulture consists of a number of sectors, different factors can influence its well being, e.g. weather can very much influence both the growth of plants and demand for plants as is evidenced by the recent bad weather which depressed demand for nursery stock.   Other factors include the role of the supermarkets, exchange rates particularly in the mushroom sector and energy costs.  Whilst the industry is under some pressure, the outlook is generally positive.</p>

            <p eId="para_7680">I have recently introduced legislation (S.I. No. 155 of 2012) to give effect to EU Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. My Department issued a proposal for public consultation in July 2011 and comments received were taken into account when drafting the legislation. The legislation sets down deadline dates by which its various provisions must be met.<i>Inter alia</i>, the legislation requires professional users of pesticides to hold a certificate confirming that he/she has been trained to a standard listed in Annex I to the Directive, by 26th November 2015. In addition, professional users are required to apply the general principles of Integrated Pest Management by 1st   January 2014 as set out in Annex III to the Directive. Appropriate training will be made available. The Sustainable Use Directive aims to reduce the risk from pesticide usage on human health and the environment and is designed to further enhance the high level of protection for man, animals and the environment achieved through the regulatory system for pesticides.  </p>

            <p eId="para_7685">The Bord Bia horticulture activities and programmes, which are developed in co-operation with the horticulture sector, are essentially matters for Bord Bia and the sector and I would refer the Deputy to Bord Bia in relation to operational details.</p>
            <p eId="para_7686">The impact of some of this activity was on display last weekend when nearly 80,000 people attended the Bord Bia 2012 Bloom Show, which showcased the benefits of gardening and the horticulture and food sectors.  The cost of Bloom is around €3 million of which Bord Bia contributes €450,000 and the balance is borne by stakeholders, ticket sales etc. Bloom is a major promotional vehicle for the horticulture sector that delivers significant outcomes including advertising equivalent, direct sales at the event for participants, post event purchases and new product listings.  Bord Bia also provides finance to pay for the reconstruction at Bloom of the winning garden on a TV gardening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7687">EU state aid rules do not allow Bord Bia to fund labels on the lines of private sector initiatives such as Love Irish Food, which emphasise origin.  The rules allow origin to be shown in a secondary capacity and Bord Bia horticulture Quality Assurance schemes do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_7690">The Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988, confers on Teagasc statutory responsibility for the provision of education, advisory and training services to the agriculture sector. It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</p>

            <p eId="para_7692">To ensure comprehensive consultation across the horticultural sector in the redevelopment of horticultural awards, FETAC established a Horticultural Standards Development Group which was chaired by Teagasc and included representatives from a wide range of stakeholders including the organic sector, fruit and vegetable growers, state agencies and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_7693">I am advised by Teagasc that the external examination verifier assigned to agricultural colleges reviews both student records for practical training periods and the student reports issued by horticultural growers who host horticultural students on placements.

            <p eId="para_7703">The HSE, which has statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, has been conducting a national audit of all Catholic dioceses and Religious Orders. I have indicated previously that I am awaiting receipt of the HSE's diocesan report before responding to any calls for the establishment of further State or other inquiries into any dioceses. The HSE expects to be in a position shortly to furnish this report to me, which I expect will provide a fuller basis on which to determine the most appropriate next steps and will inform the Government's decisions in relation to this matter. It is my intention to publish the HSE's diocesan report.</p>
            <p eId="para_7704">The Government is committed to strengthening the arrangements for the reporting of concerns of abuse by putting the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis. The necessary legislation is being worked on by my Department as a priority. This legislation will not only bring forward statutory requirements on organisations and individuals to report, but it will also support all of civil society in understanding what to do when they have concerns about a child. The roll out of Children First will require all sectors and organisations working with children, including the faith sector, to put in place and demonstrate that they have robust safeguarding arrangements. In this context I very much welcome the work undertaken to date by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in seeking to strengthen child protection practices in the Catholic Church. The National Board continues to engage directly with the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services on a programme of action designed to ensure that the Catholic Church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns, and that it has in place the necessary safeguarding structures and practices to fully protect children who come into contact with the church.</p>

            <p eId="para_7706">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides one free pre-school year to each eligible child, is implemented by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7707">The ECCE programme was introduced in January 2010, and a number of transitional measures were included to make it more acceptable to the childcare sector.  One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.</p>
            <p eId="para_7708">I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The Síolta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_7709">My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, from September 2012, services participating in the ECCE programme will be required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks. It will not be mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee will be reduced accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_7713">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   About 65,000 children, that is, approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7714">Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2008 and 30 June 2009 will qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2012 and children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2010 will qualify in September 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_7715">The implementation of these age limits means that a proportion of eligible children, for example, children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2009 can avail of the free preschool year in either September 2012 or September 2013.  All other eligible children, with the exception of special needs children who can opt for a pro-rata arrangement over two years, have only one school year in which to avail of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7716">Where a parent, having enrolled a child in the ECCE programme, subsequently decides that it would be more beneficial for the child to defer the pre-school year until the following year, s/he may apply for a deferral.  Such applications require completion and submission of a Deferral form, and can only be made where the child will still fulfil the eligibility criteria for admission to the programme in September of the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7717">If the application to defer the pre-school place is approved, any capitation fees already paid to the service provider in respect of that child will be recouped from the service provider by the Department.  It is necessary, therefore, for the parent to come to an arrangement with the service provider to repay the capitation fee in respect of any weeks in which the child has received the ECCE service.  For this reason, the deferral application form must be signed by the service provider as well as the parent.</p>

            <p eId="para_7719">The Family Support Agency (FSA), under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme. The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. There are 107 family resource centres throughout the country funded under the programme. The programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.</p>
            <p eId="para_7720">Family Resource Centres have an important role to play, in harnessing local community efforts, in support of improved outcomes for children and young people which is a key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7721">In 2012 an allocation of €26.465m has been made available to the Family Support Agency to fund its services for families.  This includes funding of over €15m for the Family Resource Centre Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_7726">The Adoption Authority launched an online notification and application system on the Authority's website on 13 April 2012 to allow prospective adoptive parents to apply to the Authority for an extension to their valid Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability in sufficient time before the expiry date of 31 October 2012. The Adoption Authority forwards applications made to this system  to the HSE in order that an updated assessment of the applicants may be undertaken. The Authority has advised that it is a matter for the HSE to determine the criteria for these updated assessments. The Authority has asked the HSE to deal with the applications based on the original declaration date.</p>
            <p eId="para_7727">The HSE has advised that the process for renewals of adoption declarations under previous adoption legislation included the updating of documentation and visits from social workers to update assessments. In keeping with this previous practice, and  given the length of time since original declarations were granted, the HSE has advised that all documentation needs to be updated to ensure that it accurately reflects the applicants current circumstances. Furthermore, the HSE notes that as the children likely to be available for adoption will be of an older age group (in compliance with the Hague Convention) and given that many applicants currently have declarations for the adoption of younger children, the older age group of children likely to be available for adoption will need to be taken account of in the renewal process. The HSE has advised that applications will be kept under review to ensure that those high on waiting lists will be accommodated.</p>
            <p eId="para_7728">In relation to the individuals referred to in the details supplied, the HSE has confirmed that information and the necessary documentation has been posted to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_7730">My Department is leading an initiative to develop and implement a planning model for local interagency working to improve outcomes for children. This is known as the<i>Working Together for Children </i>initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to work towards better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of policies and services, in particular through the Children’s Services Committees at local level. </p>
            <p eId="para_7731">Children's Services Committees bring together a diverse group of agencies in local county areas to engage in joint planning of services for children. These include representatives from the HSE, local authorities, An Garda Síochána, VECs, National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Irish Primary Principals Network, NEWB, and other organisations who provide services to children and young people. There are 10 in place with an additional 6 in the preparatory stage of set up.</p>
            <p eId="para_7732">My Department has developed a number of guidance supports for the Children's Services Committees to assist in their development. These include a toolkit which provides advice on the composition of a committee, membership, roles and information and guidance on how to develop a children and young people's plan for their area. A Governance Framework deals with matters such as national and local governance structures and reporting arrangements. The initiative is overseen by the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group which is responsible for developing Children's Services Committees as a national initiative and for providing guidance to the committees on issues that arise in relation to effective collaborative working at local level in support of children and young people's better outcomes. Information on the toolkit and other supports for the committees and the work of the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group is available on my department's website,<i>www.dcya.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_7733">The nature of the relationship between the Children's Services Committees and the new Child and Family Support Agency is among the issues being considered by the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_7734">I established the Task Force in September 2011 and it will advise my Department in regard to the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, and will base its work on best practice in child welfare, family support and public administration; consistent with the Government's public sector reform agenda.  I look forward to receiving the report of their work, which will inform preparations for the new Agency, including the relationship between it and the Children's Services Committees.</p>

            <p eId="para_7738">With effect from 1 November 2010, intercountry adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Adoption Convention) or with countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Kazakhstan has ratified the Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_7739">Over the past 18 months the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) has written to its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan on three separate occasions to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for intercountry adoption. To date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities to any of the contacts made by the AAI. The Authority continues to indicate that it is open to discussing the issue of intercountry adoptions with its Kazakhstani counterparts at any time, and the most recent correspondence from the AAI was in March of this year. I understand that an official of the Irish Embassy in Moscow has now presented the copy correspondence to, and raised the issue of intercountry adoption with, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kazakhstan.  I understand the Kazakhstani authorities hosted a meeting on intercountry adoption on the 11th of May. I would like to point out that at no stage were the AAI, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Embassy contacted by the Kazakhstani authorities regarding the meeting. While it is, of course, a matter for each country to decide with whom it co-operates, as soon as the issue came to the attention of my Department, official contact was made with the Embassy in Moscow in this regard. The Embassy officials in Moscow are endeavouring to secure feedback from this meeting to assess its relevance for progress towards an administrative agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and Kazakhstan</p>
            <p eId="para_7740">The Embassy has been asked to request information from the relevant authorities on the position for Irish couples hoping to adopt from Kazakhstan as soon as possible.  In the interim the AAI is currently completing a review of Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.</p>

         if an assessment has been carried out of the cost of introducing a mandatory aftercare policy for children in the care of the State once they turn 18 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_7787">Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a "need for assistance" and if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_7788">All young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care or high support, are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs. The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education in which he/she is engaged up to the age of 23 years of age. The HSE has advised me that there were 1,310 young people were in receipt of aftercare at the end of May 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_7789">The basis of an aftercare service is an individual assessment of each young person's need. This varies from advice to accommodation ,  further education, employment or training and social support. The most vulnerable group of young people leaving care are those that have dropped out of education and training and those that have left residential care. Some of these young people have mental health problems or a disability. Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support. An individual holistic needs assessment identifies a young person's need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education in the months before their 18th birthday. The level of support required will vary for each individual.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element to achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.</p>
            <p eId="para_7790">Some 90% of children in care are in foster care and a large number of these remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age. These young people continue in education and training as planned. This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care.</p>
            <p eId="para_7791">The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which has been developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies involved in aftercare provision and my Department. The policy which was finalised in April 2011, commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. The HSE has established an intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group to monitor progress in implementing the national policy and their work is ongoing. The implementation of the policy and the ongoing provision of aftercare services is being kept under review and I will continue to engage with the HSE on this matter over the course of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7820">A sum of €350,000 has been made available to the Irish Youth Justice Service for 2012 to fund capital projects within the Children Detention Schools, in a series of improvements to fire safety measures.  It is expected that the capital commitment will be fully expended before the year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_7821">In addition to this, funding for a capital project to construct children detention facilities of €50 m approximately was announced in April 2012 and it  is expected that this will be spent over the period to 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_7822">Childcare Programmes</p>
            <p eId="para_7823">Capital funding of €6 million has been made available in 2012 to fund a maintenance programme for childcare facilities.  The maximum grant available to individual services under the programme is €50,000 (including VAT).  The programme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal.  The appraisal process has been completed and recommendations have been made to the Department. Successful applicants will be notified shortly.  Subsequent arrangements regarding contract, payment, reporting and audit will be dealt with by Pobal on behalf of my Department. This capital funding is specific to 2012, and the funding must be spent within this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7824">In addition, capital funding of €500,000 has been provided in 2012 for grants under the Parent and Toddler Initiative and the Childminder Development Grant Scheme.  Under the Parent and Toddler Initiative, an amount of €250,000 has been provided to support grants to parent and toddler groups with a particular focus on disadvantaged areas.  This initiative is administered by the City and County Childcare Committees. A sum of €250,000 has also been provided for the Childminder Development Grant Scheme under which capital grants of up to €1,000 can be applied for to purchase safety equipment or toys or to make minor adjustments to the childminder's home in order to establish or enhance a childminding service.  This funding is also administered by the City and County Childcare Committees.</p>

            <p eId="para_7826">As part of the Government's Capital Review published in November 2011, capital funding of €1.5 million has been secured for youth projects in 2012.  It is anticipated that a significant portion of this funding will be specifically allocated to youth cafés.  My Department is currently examining options for the most effective distribution of this funding and an announcement will be made in due course in relation to how the funds will be distributed. The priority will be to ensure that the maximum impact and cost effectiveness is achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_7828">Adoptions from Russia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_7829">As regards adoptions thereafter, Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  Therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bi-lateral agreement.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_7830">A delegation comprised of representatives of the Adoption Authority and officials from my Department held exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in December of last year. The delegation visited Russia in relation to preliminary discussions around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption.  This was a follow up to previous discussions which took place earlier in the year, on the initiative of the Russian authorities. I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority. My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_7833">I propose to take Questions Nos. 806 and 808 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7834">Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.</p>
            <p eId="para_7835">Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_7836">A delegation from the Adoption Authority  visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption. The Authority submitted its initial report which summarises the conclusions and recommendations of the delegation's visit on the 21st of May.  In addition, the Embassy in Ethiopia recently submitted a detailed background note on intercountry adoption in Ethiopia, which officials in my Department are considering in conjunction with the AAI report.  The AAI has stated that it is seeking further legal advice in Ethiopia on whether adoptions there are full or simple adoptions. The Authority indicated that it will contact me again once it has received this legal advice and has completed its consideration of the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_7976">Under the Child Care Act 1991 the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. In such circumstances children can be taken into care on a voluntary basis (on agreement with the parents) or under various Court Orders as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_7977">The HSE has a legal obligation and a duty of care to all children in care regardless of whether they have a criminal conviction, or are engaged in sexually harmful behaviour. Each child must be cared for in a safe and caring environment. When a child is coming into care they are allocated a social worker who undertakes a full assessment of need and on this basis a statutory care plan is developed. This assessment will call on a full range of professionals, where required, to set out a comprehensive statement of the child's needs. A risk assessment is also carried out that takes into consideration the risk to others.  A care plan is then developed which includes safeguards that need to be put in place to ensure that the risks are kept to minimum. The care plan also determines the support and interventions needed with regard to the family situation where it is planned that a child will return home.  The care plan directs the placement most appropriate to the needs of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_7978">I am advised by the HSE that there were 6,168 children in the care of the state in February 2012. However data collected at national does not currently include information on the number of children in care with criminal convictions.   I have previously asked the HSE to examine inclusion of appropriate national data on criminal charges or convictions in the National Child Care Information System.</p>
            <p eId="para_7979">Young people who have committed offences, or have caused harm, need to be given an opportunity to understand the consequences of their behaviour in as positive an environment as possible. This is achieved through therapeutic interventions, ongoing assessment of risk and the inclusion of safeguards. On the rare occasion where a child in care my commit a crime the matter is deal with by local services in the context of the child or young person's care plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_7981">Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline. My Department established, and is leading, a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda Síochána to advance this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_7982">The position is that Comreg, who have responsibility for allocation of this number in Ireland, received an application to operate the Hotline from the ISPCC.  Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project team, Comreg has now allocated the number to the ISPCC. The operation of the Hotline is now a matter for the ISPCC who have made a successful application for funding to the European Commission. The ISPCC are currently finalising the project plan for the Hotline. To date no application for Exchequer funding has been received by my Department from the ISPCC. In the event that such an application is forthcoming it will be considered in the context of the ongoing work of the Project Team which has met with the ISPCC and is working to ensure that the Hotline becomes operational as soon as possible and operates in a way that supports and augments existing arrangements to secure child protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_7983">In the interim, a holding response is currently heard if an individual rings the 116000 number. The number advises callers wishing to report a missing child to contact An Garda Síochána and advises children seeking assistance to contact the ISPCC.</p>

            <p eId="para_7987">I propose to take Questions Nos. 818 to 820, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7988">The Community Childcare Subvention scheme (CCSS), which provided funding to community child care services to enable them to charge reduced child care rates to low income and disadvantaged families, was introduced in January 2008 and was implemented under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).</p>
            <p eId="para_7989">In Budget 2010, the Minister for Finance announced that the CCSS programme would be succeeded by a follow-on programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, with effect from September 2010.  This new programme continued to support community child care services and some 1,000 services throughout the State are currently participating in the CCS programme and receive funding which is passed on to qualifying parents in the form of reduced child care fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_7990">Funding allocated to provide for these subvention programmes amounted to €52.175m in 2008; €60.778m in 2009; €54.506m in 2010 and €42.5m in 2011.  €42m has been allocated for the programme in 2012. The programme would at any given time support in the region of 25,000 children with some children benefiting from the programme over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7991">Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The amount of annual funding provided for child care services participating in the CCS programme is determined early in the school year and follows submission to my Department, by the child care provider, of the profile of eligible parents who have children enrolled in its service. Because of the current budgetary situation no new places are available to service providers seeking to enter this programme in 2012.  However, in exceptional circumstances where a participating service closes or opts out of the programme, a new applicant may be considered to take up the vacated place in the programme if they are in a position to meet the child care need arising.</p>

            <p eId="para_7999">In its report on alcohol, the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group recommended — among other things — the introduction of a legislative basis for minimum pricing per gram of alcohol. As minimum pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption. This recommendation is being actively considered as part of the development of an Action Plan in advance of proposals being drafted for Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_8003">Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_8004">Furthermore, a person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a substance controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_8008">I can confirm that the two "G" certificates referred to in the 2010 statistics are the same ones listed in the 2009 statistics. Typically, licences are held for 5 years so these certificates will also be recorded in subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_8009">"G" certificates are issued on a case-by-case basis and are issued only in exceptional circumstances where the project is of sufficient importance for meeting the essential needs of human beings or animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_8010">All LD50/LC50 tests would not necessarily require a "G" certificate. The two certificates that have been issued relate to two current licences in respect of the same project. The aim of this project is to develop substances to improve neuromuscular transmission for therapeutic purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8011">Directive 2010/63/EU will be transposed into Irish law by the end of 2012 and from that date onwards, the existing certification process will no longer operate. Article 15 of the 2010 Directive, as you have pointed out, forbids procedures that involve severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long-lasting and cannot be ameliorated. In addition, under the new national legislation, the National Competent Authority will perform a project evaluation including a harm/benefit analysis of the project, to assess whether the harm to the animal in terms of suffering, pain and distress is justified by the expected outcome taking into account ethical considerations and may ultimately benefit human beings, animals or the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8012">I would like to advise the Deputy that I have informed the Chairman of the Irish Medicines Board of my intention to designate the Board as the National Competent Authority for Directive 2010/63/EU and to have responsibility for those other functions of the Directive necessary for its implementation.</p>

The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.

            <p eId="para_8405">While there have been increases in productivity on foot of the Programme for Government and the 2008 Consultant Contract, one of my immediate priorities is to achieve more effective implementation of the 2008 Contract so that patients get faster access to services and achieve better outcomes within the budgets available to hospitals.  I believe there is plenty of scope under the existing contract and the Croke Park agreement to achieve greater productivity increases from consultants than have been achieved to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_8406">Bilateral discussions with the consultant representative bodies commenced on 16 May 2012.  This process is to be focussed on the achievement of worthwhile and measurable change and must be concluded within a reasonable period, in line with the provisions of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.  Consultants' hours, times of duty and public/private mix are among the matters on which health service management have tabled proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_8407">Consultant Contract 2008 limits private practice for newly-appointed consultants on a Type B or C contract to 20% of activity. The upper limit for consultants who held a contract prior to 2008 is 30%.</p>
            <p eId="para_8408">The HSE has put in place arrangements to measure consultants' private practice and has engaged with the medical unions and individual consultants to pursue the issue of compliance, with a particular focus on consultants who are significantly in breach of their permitted ratio. Currently 49 consultants have been identified as being in excess of the ratio specified in their contract and hospital management are engaged with the consultants, in line with the terms of the contract, to secure compliance.</p>

            <p eId="para_8414">The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 is on the list of Bills to be published in this session of Dail Eireann. This legislation will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines. These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients. The rate of generic prescribing in Ireland is approximately 18%. It is envisaged that the proposed legislation will contribute to an increase in this rate. It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.</p>

            <p eId="para_8421">The interim HSE Board which I established in May 2011 was designed to facilitate greater coordination and integration and less duplication between the senior management teams in my Department and the HSE.   The interim Board has provided a basis on which to make early progress on the health reform agenda, facilitating a greater unity of purpose.  It also streamlines reporting relationships to ensure that decisions are implemented quickly and as a result, better services are delivered for patients with greater emphasis on service delivery.  Table 1 below sets out the current composition of the interim Board, the roles of those on the Board within the Department and the HSE and all changes since it was established.</p>
            <p eId="para_8422">On 29 May, the Government approved the drafting of legislation to abolish the Board of the HSE and to provide for a Directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the Board.  The intention is that the Bill will be drafted as a matter of urgency so that it can be considered by the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  In tandem with the proposed new governance structures, new administrative structures will be put in place in the HSE, to reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.</p>

            <p eId="para_8450">While there has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by 76,000 in the year to end-March 2012, it is important to note that the decline in private health insurance coverage is modest to-date, at less than 4% of the overall market. This leaves some 2.139 million, or 46.6% of the population, covered by private health insurance. Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers with private health insurance are retaining some level of health insurance cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_8451">The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland and provides information to consumers regarding their rights and health insurance plans and benefits. With regard to the number of customers who have left the private health insurance market by county, the HIA has advised that it does not compile figures on the geographical profile of the health insurance market. In relation to the average change in premiums, the HIA has estimated that the average premium increase per customer is 12 per cent, when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. The highest increases were 49% for VHI Healthcare's PMI 0611 Plan (€711 to €1060); 37% for Laya Healthcare's Company Care Choice (€713 to €974) and 37% for Aviva Health's Level 2 Hospital (€941 to €1291), although it is important to note that a relatively small number of consumers hold these specific health insurance plans and are affected by these increases. The HIA has informed my Department that any figures calculated for time periods of less than one year (i.e. since Budget 2012) would be distorted, as this is usually the time of the year that insurers normally apply price changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8452">I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. All customers should carefully consider the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market, so that their own needs are fully met. Where customers wish to switch products, the relevant health insurance legislation ensures that switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers. In addition to the choices available to consumers in the health insurance market, the Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance.</p>

            <p eId="para_8454">Last year, I received a number of unsolicited submissions about the provision, by the private sector, of dedicated aeromedical support services in the west of Ireland.  I also considered the possibility of provision from within existing state resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_8455">The absence of data for aeromedical support in the Irish context indicated the need for a pilot project, in order to assess the type and extent of service, if any, that might be required to support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_8456">I am pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, a pilot has now been put in place to gather this information and it will run for 12 months. The pilot service, which has just begun, will allow the HSE to determine how best to provide support to the NAS emergency ambulance service in the region in the longer term and how we can, realistically, improve response and transit times, and improve outcomes, for seriously ill people.</p>
            <p eId="para_8457">In current conditions, it is prudent to maximise the use of state resources wherever possible. Accordingly, the pilot project is being operated from within existing resources. The Air Corps is providing an EC135 helicopter at Custume Barracks, Athlone, along with personnel to fly and maintain the craft. The NAS is responsible for patient care, which will be provided by Advanced Paramedics.</p>

            <p eId="para_8459">The HSE has no statutory obligation to provide patient transport, other than emergency transport. The cost to the health service of providing  non-emergency patient transport, in particular for outpatient (OPD) appointments, has been escalating in recent years and non-essential provision has been identified as an area suitable for budgetary control.  Accordingly, criteria have been restricted considerably in recent times and a uniform approach is being rolled out across the health regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8460">In general, patients are expected to make their own way to and from hospital and OPD appointments, using private or scheduled public transport. e exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients. In these cases, the patient's appointment should be directly related to the treatment. Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.</p>
            <p eId="para_8461">Where transport has been withdrawn, having previously been provided, this may be as a result of the Local Health Office (LHO) beginning to implement the national criteria. If a patient feels there is a genuine case for provision, then they should approach the LHO. If they feel there is a genuine clinical reason for transport to be provided, their clinician should make a case for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_8471">The Government has recently approved the drafting of legislation to abolish the Board of the Health Service Executive and to provide for a Directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the Board.  The intention is that the Bill will be drafted as a matter of urgency so that it can be considered by the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  In tandem with the proposed new legal structures, new administrative structures will be put in place within the HSE which will reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.  The new arrangements will include a separate Directorate for Mental Health.  Consideration is currently being given to how best to give effect to the new administrative structures, including the selection and appointment of new directors at national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_8472">The mental health sector is protected by the Mental Health Commission which is an independent statutory body established under the Mental Health Act 2001 to  promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services.  Concerns about specific mental health services can be notified to the Commission and these are taken into account on inspections of services.  The issue of a complaints mechanism will be looked at in the context of the current review of the Mental Health Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_8473">Since taking office, this Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community.  A special allocation of €35m for mental health was announced in Budget 2012 in line with the Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children's mental health services which will ensure, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes.  Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_8475">Government policy is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible. This is realised through a range of community based services such as mainstream Home Help, enhanced provision via Home Care Packages,  or through other service elements such as Meals-on-Wheels, Day Care or Respite Care.</p>
            <p eId="para_8476">While the recently agreed HSE Service Plan for 2012 involves a reduction of around 3.5% in Home Help hours nationally, from just over 11m hours in 2011 to 10.7m hours this year, the corresponding reduction proposed in the actual number of people receiving Home Help drops by just under 2% or, in other words, from around 51,000 recipients last year to 50,000 in 2012. This reflects an increased focus by the HSE towards more personalised care for the most vulnerable older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_8477">I would also draw  the Deputy's attention to the fact that the HSE Service Plan 2012  maintains Home Care Packages for this year at 2011 levels. Such Packages usually contain a significant Home Help element. This again indicates the commitment of the Government to provide the best possible services to the most vulnerable older people, in the light of  evolving  resources and competing demands in respect of the years in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_8489">My Department's priority at all times has been that the three treating clinics involved in the PIP breast implant issue provide professional and appropriate care to their affected clients.  The Chief Medical Officer has met with and continues to engage with the clinics to ensure that best practice and patient support is paramount in the service provided to concerned recipients of these implants.  It has been impressed on the treating clinics that an appropriate care programme must be in place and that clinical care should be provided to each client as considered appropriate by their treating surgeon.  The provision of an improved care package by one of the treating clinics has been the subject of intense discussions between my officials and the provider concerned and the CMO continues to liaise with the provider in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_8491">The Department's website and the website of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) continue to provide regular updates and information on the ongoing EU and international scientific investigation of PIP implants.

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8492">there is no evidence of increased risk of cancer for women with this brand of implant;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8493">the risk of rupture is within expected norms and routine explantation is not recommended;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8494">anyone with a concern about their breast implants should discuss the matter with their GP or surgeon.</p>
            <p eId="para_8495">In addition, the Chief Medical Officer appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on 3rd May last to fully brief and answer members' questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8496">The resolution of the implants issue has to be between provider and client and an appropriate solution found between the parties; my Department will continue to encourage all parties to reach an acceptable solution for all concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_8509">When a person dies, it is the duty of a relative of the deceased to act as qualified informant. This means that the relative must give to a registrar of births, deaths and marriages the information necessary to register the death, including a medical certificate of the cause of death, which is obtainable from the medical practitioner who attended the deceased, and sign the register of deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_8510">In certain circumstances, a death is referred to the Coroner. There is a legal responsibility on doctors, registrars, undertakers, Gardai, hospitals and nursing homes to inform the Coroner where a death occurs suddenly or unexpectedly, or from a cause unknown, unclear or unnatural, or where the deceased was not seen or treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month prior to death.</p>
            <p eId="para_8511">In such cases, the Coroner may request a post-mortem examination. If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to natural causes, the Coroner may issue a certificate to the Registrar, who can then proceed to register the death and issue a death certificate. If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to unnatural causes, the Coroner may cause an inquest to be held. In such cases, the Registrar must await the outcome of the inquest and the issue by the Coroner of a coroner's certificate before the death can be registered.</p>
            <p eId="para_8512">In relation to the specific raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_8516">The development of a National Carers Strategy to support carers and to address issues of concern is a key commitment in the current Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_8517">The Strategy will address the needs of informal and family carers. It will be conceptual and visionary and will establish a number of high-level principles, goals and objectives and a road map to implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8518">The State already faces challenges in maintaining existing levels of services from within limited resources and the Strategy is being developed in that context. The Strategy will not be an operational plan but will set the strategic direction for future services and supports for carers in recognition of their role and contribution to maintaining children, adults and older people with physical or mental health difficulties in their own homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8519">While issues relating to carers span a number of different Departments, the Taoiseach has allocated responsibility for co-ordination of the preparation of the Strategy to me with the support of the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_8520">Work on developing the Strategy is on-going and a consultation process with other Departments took place in early 2012. A draft was completed at the end of March as a basis for final consultations with other Departments and with national organisations representing carers. Carers organisations made formal observations at the end of May.  It is hoped that a draft will be completed for submission to Government during the Summer.</p>

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_8551">In July 2011, I introduced a strict policy of chronological management of inpatient waiting lists so that after urgent and cancer patients are treated those waiting longest are treated first.  This policy is working in the interests of fairness.  I acknowledge that there has been an increase in the numbers waiting over 6 months.  It was anticipated that this would happen as a result of the significant decreases in the numbers waiting in the over 9 month and 12 month categories.  So while it has been reported that there was a 24% increase in number waiting over 6 months there has been a 77% drop in the numbers of adults waiting over 12 months to just 474 people and an 84% drop in the numbers of children waiting over 12 months to just 48.

            <p eId="para_8553">Throughout 2012 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity. These beds may be closed for a number of reasons, including cost containment, infection control and refurbishment. It is not possible at this time to determine what beds in which wards will be closed and what length of time they will be closed for. The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_8555">My Department has no plans to carry out research into the impact of patients presenting in public hospitals who previously held private health insurance. In respect of access to public hospitals, the work of the Special Delivery Unit is focussed on improving wait times for access to both scheduled and unscheduled treatments and to maximise the capacity of existing facilities to manage patient flow.</p>
            <p eId="para_8556">While there has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by 76,000 in the year to end-March 2012, it is important to note that the decline in private health insurance coverage is modest to-date, at less than 4% of the overall market. This leaves some 2.139 million, or 46.6% of the population, covered by private health insurance. Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers with private health insurance are retaining some level of health insurance cover. In this context, I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. All customers should carefully consider the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market, so that their own needs are fully met. Where customers wish to switch products, the relevant health insurance legislation ensures that switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8557">In addition to the choices available to consumers in the health insurance market, the Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance.</p>

            <p eId="para_8559">The HSE Business Information Unit centrally collates statistics on delayed discharges. These statistics are a representation of the percentage of beds days lost with respect to the total number of available bed days, due to their occupancy by patients who have been deemed as being medically fit for discharge home with additional support, or awaiting transfer to rehabilitation off site, or a non-acute residential care setting. The figures indicated will not necessarily reflect those patients who may have been assessed for suitability for a nursing home place.</p>
            <p eId="para_8560">Many of the SDU initiatives to date have been targeted at the patients remaining in acute beds post medical discharge and these have involved increased access to home supports and transitional care. A specific project aimed at improving the quality of care delivery to the frail older person is being finalised and a group will be set up to oversee implementation of this national initiative on care of the frail older person. The project aim is to support the frail older person at home, create direct access pathways in the acute setting, rehabilitation and transitional care settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_8561">The year to date figures for bed days lost due to delayed discharges at 14th May 2012 are detailed in the following table:</p>

The new Directive will, when transposed in Ireland and other Members States, ensure that Europe will have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_8696">The new Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used). The provisions of the new Directive also strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing. Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  These new measures will apply from 2013 and , from that date onwards, the existing certification process will no longer operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_8697">On the specific matter raised by the Deputy, it is the case that that in a very limited number of occasions, it has been necessary to issue "G" certificates on that basis that the project was of sufficient importance for meeting the essential needs of human beings or animals. In this context,t  here are two current licences with "G" certificates. They relate to the same project and the aim of that project is to develop substances to improve neuromuscular transmission for therapeutic purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8703">All tobacco products, whether legally produced, illicit or counterfeit are injurious to health and are therefore a threat to public health. I am concerned about the level and it remains my objective that Ireland becomes a tobacco free society.</p>
            <p eId="para_8704">The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products.  My Department and the HSE support Revenue's<i>Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013).</i>  The Revenue Commissioners attach a high priority to this area, and they continuously review their response to the problem and their effectiveness in tackling the illicit tobacco trade. The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle the illicit tobacco products trade is multi-faceted. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that in 2011, a total of 109.08m cigarettes with a retail value of €45.95m and 11,158 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of  €4.00 m were been seized by Revenue.  In 2012 to date a total of 56.2m cigarettes with a retail value of €24.5m and 2,077kgs of tobacco with a retail value of €6.87m have been seized by Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_8705">The Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG ) will consider ways to denormalise smoking in society such as extending tobacco control legislation in particular for situations where children are present. It will also consider social marketing and educational programmes as well as smoking cessation services.  The Report includes a section on the illicit trade of tobacco, including the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and that this will be brought to Government for decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_8743">Hospitals have built up informal catchment areas over a number of years and any individual hospital often has a number of "catchment areas" reflecting the different geographic areas from which it normally accepts referrals of different types. Issues with catchment areas are typically cyclical and often reflect, amongst other things, the economic cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_8744">The growing budgetary and activity performance pressures on hospitals has led to some hospitals enforcing a more strict adherence to what they view as their catchment areas for different aspects of their service. It has also been legitimately queried why, in some cases, patients are bypassing recently developed suitable services in hospitals closer to the patient requiring that patient to travel longer distances to a larger tertiary hospital which is under greater pressure and may have longer outpatient waiting times.</p>
            <p eId="para_8745">It has been agreed however, that an inconsistent approach is not in the best interest of patients and therefore it has been agreed in the interim that any planned and agreed changes in referrals/catchment areas should not impact on patients who are already on a waiting list in a particular hospital or are patients in long term care/treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8746">Where, by exception, it is agreed that existing patients on a waiting list should be considered for transfer to another hospital waiting list this should be on the basis that they will be able to access their service in the new hospital earlier or at a minimum no later than had they remained on the original waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_8747">Patients should be informed of any proposed changes in advance and any concerns they may raise dealt with appropriately.  In relation to the particular patient query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_8753">In the health service, agency staff have traditionally been used to meet a short-term service need or where some flexibility in staffing a service is required. In 2011, although the HSE had negotiated new agency contracts which involve lower unit costs, the use of agency staff accounted for approximately €177 million, as outlined in the table below. This was accounted for in part by the usage of agency staffing to cover longer-term staffing needs. When locum staff, who are employed by the HSE, are added, the total amounts to over €200 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_8754">This is not a sustainable approach and the HSE's National Service Plan 2012 commits to significantly lowering the volume of agency usage across all staff functions, with a target reduction of up to 50% in 2012. The Plan also notes that the transposition into Irish law of the Temporary Agency Work Directive will increase the unit cost of agency staffing.</p>
            <p eId="para_8755">Agency staff are the employees of the agencies concerned rather than the HSE and as such the number of individuals engaged in such work is not reported.</p>

            <p eId="para_8797">My Department has not conducted a cost benefit analysis on the policy of fluoridation. Policy on this issue is guided by international studies, which indicate that the cost of water fluoridation is a small fraction of the savings in dental treatment costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8798">The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health confirms that, based on the review of all previous and current international and national scientific data, the balance of this scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be effective for protecting the oral health of all age groups. These issues have also been addressed by other recognised authorities such as the World Health Organisation. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its ‘Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water' in May 2011. +The main conclusions of the SCHER report are that there are no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. There is also extensive evidence in Ireland from a series of national, regional and cross-border studies conducted between 1984 and 2006 that fluoridated drinking water substantially improves the dental health of children and adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_8799">The Irish Expert Body does not agree with the views expressed by the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  This group does not appear to have formal accreditation as an academy and is not recognised as the representative voice for the fields of oral medicine and toxicology.</p>

            <p eId="para_8803">The HSE has stated that work is under way to develop an integrated and comprehensive communications programme for PCRS. This programme is being designed to ensure that all stakeholders including patients, patient advocacy groups, public representatives, primary care contractors and the general media are regularly informed of developments within the Medical Card Scheme. A senior communications manager has been assigned to support this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_8804">The HSE wrote to all GPs on 27 February 2012 to advise them that the centralised medical card registration unit has an emergency medical card issue process, which operates in concert with Local Health Offices and that a person can at any time seek assistance from, or direct their emergency application to their local health office. They also advised GPs that if a GP had such a case he/she should contact their Local Health Office, who can request an emergency medical card from the central office if they are satisfied that an emergency situation obtains. Furthermore, in April 2012 the HSE reiterated the position to the Joint Oireachtas Health Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and across the health system, that an Emergency application can be initiated through the Local Health Office whose manager has access to dedicated contacts in PCRS. The HSE have also provided functionality to GPs to extend eligibility in some sensitive cases where a patient may lose eligibility because he/she cannot engage or complete his/her review due to a medical condition or social circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_8825">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_8826">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.

In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_8864">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.

            <p eId="para_8905">Macrolane (containing hyaluronic acid) is a product which is administered by injection in medical and aesthetic procedures to augment body contours and correct body defects.</p>
            <p eId="para_8906">Breast augmentation procedures, including those involving Macrolane, may interfere with breast diagnostic imaging, particularly mammography.  This interference is widely published and known by the relevant healthcare professionals. Women who previously underwent a procedure with Macrolane would have been advised by clinics before their procedure as part of the consent process of the potential for the product to interfere with the reading of mammograms.</p>
            <p eId="para_8907">Macrolane was withdrawn from use in breast augmentation by the manufacturer, Q-Med in April 2012 due to a lack of consensus among radiologists regarding examination of breasts treated with injectable products.   The Irish Medicines Board has written to Irish clinics using the product and to Irish radiologists via the Royal College of Surgeons, Faculty of Radiology.    In addition, clinics have been asked by the Irish Medicines Board to remind women of the potential problems which may arise with  the interpretation of mammogram images and the importance of informing healthcare professionals of previous Macrolane treatment  before they have any breast assessment carried out. Clinics are in the process of advising women in writing or reminding them of this issue at their next consultation.</p>

            <p eId="para_8911">Shortages of essential medicines are currently a cause of concern not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and the rest of the world. It is a global problem affecting health systems in all countries and impacting on patients world-wide. Medicines shortages can be the result of one, several or any combination of factors throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain such as manufacturing difficulties, industry consolidation, and commercial decisions by manufacturers to withdraw unprofitable lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_8912">Irish Medicines Regulations place an obligation on both manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers within the limits of their respective responsibilities, to ensure the adequate availability and supply of medicines on the Irish market in order to meet patient needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8913">Eltroxin, which contains the active substance levothyroxine, is a long-established medicine that is used to control hypothyroidism, congenital hypothyroidism and juvenile myxoedema. It is marketed in tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 micrograms and is the subject of a marketing authorisation in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8914">Before anyone is allowed to market a medicine in Ireland they are required to apply for a marketing authorisation from either the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The IMB and EMA examine the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. The marketing authorisation holder for Eltroxin is the Mercury Pharma Group of which Goldshield Pharmaceuticals is a part. The product is manufactured under contract in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_8915">The current shortage of Eltroxin emerged in February 2012 when the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency suspended the authorisation of an alternative levothyroxine 100 microgram tablet product, not on the Irish market, with the effect that the overall supply of levothyroxine on the Irish and UK markets was reduced.  The HSE and the IMB have been managing the shortage of Eltroxin and issued a joint communication (26th April 2012) via the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) updating pharmacists on management of the shortage. The HSE put in place special arrangements to reimburse suitable UK licensed product stock and this was notified to community pharmacists on 1st   May 2012. The HSE and IMB continue to closely monitor this issue to ensure ongoing access to this important medicine. In addition, the PSI has recently published guidance to registered pharmacists on managing medicines shortages.</p>
            <p eId="para_8916">My Department has been engaging with the IMB,  the HSE and the PSI to identify ways in which the Irish system can manage medicines shortages as effectively as possible in order to minimise the impact on patients. International efforts to effectively manage medicines shortages are also being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_9011">The Government is committed to fundamental reform of the healthcare system that will deliver a single tier health system, supported by universal health insurance, where access is based on need, not income. Every citizen will have a choice of insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9012">There are a number of key stepping stones that will play a critical role in paving the way for the introduction of universal health insurance. Significant work has already been undertaken to progress these. They include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9013">the strengthening of the primary care sector to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier. The Government has established a Universal Primary Care Project Team to oversee the introduction of universal primary care.  In addition, the Government has given its approval to the preparation of Heads of a Bill to progress the phased introduction of  free GP care in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. It is envisaged that the first phase will provide for the extension of access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed long term illnesses or disabilities under the new legislation.</p>

An important part of the Programme for Government is the establishment of independent not-for-profit trusts. As a first step, non-statutory hospital groups will be set up which will have a single clinical governance model, one budget and one employment ceiling.  The hospital groups will be established on the clear understanding that the groupings and their governance arrangements will be reviewed prior to 2015 to ensure an appropriate environment for the introduction of UHI.</p>

A number of initiatives are already underway including a patient level costing project and a pilot initiative in relation to prospective funding of certain elective orthopaedic procedures, at selected sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_9016">In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance. The Group will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme. A project team comprised of senior Department of Health officials has also been established to support the work of the Implementation Group.  The initial work of the Group will focus on assisting in developing work plans and overseeing reform work in relation to each of the following key work streams: hospital financing; hospital structures; regulation of the hospital sector; the private health insurance market and the overarching UHI design.</p>
            <p eId="para_9017">The reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful sequencing over a number of years. The Implementation Group will continue in existence throughout the health reform process and will oversee different elements of the reforms as they are being put in place. It is also intended that it will consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_9019">Last year, I received a number of unsolicited submissions about the provision, by the private sector, of dedicated aeromedical support services in the west of Ireland.  I also considered the possibility of provision from within existing state resources.  The absence of data for aeromedical support in the Irish context indicated the need for a pilot project, in order to assess the type and extent of service, if any, that might be required to support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_9020">I am pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, a pilot has now been put in place to gather this information and it will run for 12 months. The pilot service, which has just begun, will allow the HSE to determine how best to provide support to the NAS emergency ambulance service in the region in the longer term and how we can, realistically, improve response and transit times, and improve outcomes, for seriously ill people.  In current conditions, it is prudent to maximise the use of state resources wherever possible. Accordingly, the pilot project is being operated from within existing resources. The Air Corps is providing an EC135 helicopter at Custume Barracks, Athlone, along with personnel to fly and maintain the craft. The NAS is responsible for patient care, which will be provided by Advanced Paramedics.</p>

            <p eId="para_9033">Maximum weight limits and dimensions of goods vehicles in the European Union (EU) are set at 40 tonnes over 5 axles by EC Directive 96/53/EC and incorporated into Irish law by the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, S.I. No. 5 of 2003. While Directive 96/53/EC sets maximum limits for vehicles moving between jurisdictions within the EU it does not impose an absolute weight limit for national vehicle movement. This allows Ireland to set its own internal gross vehicle weight (GVW) limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_9034">The maximum weights apply regardless of what type of load is carried but are dependent on several factors including vehicle design, number of axles, braking systems and type of suspension. The current maximum weight that a six-axle articulated HGV or a six-axle rigid HGV towing a trailer can operate at in Ireland is 44 tonnes GVW.  A review was recently completed to assess the appropriateness of existing weight limits and investigate possible weight changes. The review identified and assessed the technical, legal, safety and commercial considerations for changing GVWs of goods vehicles in Ireland.  Freight trends here were investigated along with international best practice for the movement of goods. A detailed consultation process was carried out with sectoral representatives, interest groups and major stakeholders. A report containing recommendations was submitted to my Department.  I am currently considering the outcome of this review and expect to make regulations on this matter shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_9291">The National Transport Authority (NTA) was established on 1 December 2009.  In accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority (DTA) Act 2008, the functions of the NTA include securing the provision of public transport infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  Among the functions of the NTA with respect to the GDA transport infrastructure is the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network. In this regard and in accordance with section 62 of the DTA Act 2008, the Authority may designate any bus stop, bus stand, bus or railway station in the GDA to be a shared facility.  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this matter I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p>

            <p eId="para_9295">The payment of performance related pay is a matter for the Boards of the State agencies concerned.  However, the operation of performance-related award schemes for Chief Executive Officers in the public bodies is currently being reviewed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Pending the outcome of the Review, the Government has made its policy clear that such bonuses should not be paid to Chief Executive Officers.  Full details of all CEO remuneration is available from the annual report of the relevant agency. My Department does not have the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the other staff in these agencies. I have, however, forwarded your request to the agencies under the remit of my Department for direct reply to you. If you do not hear within ten working days please contact my private office.</p>

            <p eId="para_9406">The regulation of the taxi industry, including issues pertaining to the transfer of vehicle licences, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_9407">As set out in the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011, it was considered by the review group that it was necessary to move away from a system whereby a licence will have value in itself — a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should not have monetary value or be traded on the open market.  Action 14 of the review report proposes the introduction of a prohibition on the transferability of taxi vehicle licences such that all taxi vehicle licences will be unique to the person to whom the licence has been issued and cannot be transferred or sold to another individual.</p>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a statutory matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_9422">The M20 project has been withdrawn from An Bord Pleanála but the project has not been abandoned as it may be re-initiated in the future.   Had An Bord Pleanála approved the M20 project, the NRA/local authorities concerned would have been required to exercise the CPO authorisation within 18 months or the approval would have lapsed.  Without a facility in place to advance the construction stage of the project it would not be appropriate to incur significant land costs on the project at this time. It should be noted that the N21 Adare bypass remains with An Bord Pleanála for decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_9423">In cases such as the M20 project, planning authorities have been requested to make all reasonable efforts to protect identified preferred route corridors.  Within these parameters, however, there may be scope for planning authorities to accommodate some development within the route corridors.</p>
