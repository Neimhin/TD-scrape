            <p eId="para_3">The Government is committed to ensuring that patients throughout the country continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas, and that general practice is sustainable in such areas in future. It is imperative that services meet patient needs, that existing GP services are maintained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Under the current General Medical Services contract, GPs who practise in remote rural areas of low population qualify for special rural practice concessions, including an annual rural practice allowance of a little over €16,200, subsidies towards the employment of certain practice staff at the maximum applicable rate, regardless of the size of the patient panel, and the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Where a GP holds the allowance but the circumstances underpinning it change, the GP retains the allowance while he or she continues to practise in that location. When a new GP commences in the area, the application for the allowance is considered afresh by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> The HSE has recently reviewed its guidelines for dealing with applications for a rural practice allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">The purpose of the new guidance is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in decision making in respect of the relevant discretionary provisions of the GMS contract pertaining to the granting or otherwise of the allowance to new applicants. The new guidance does not affect existing holders of the allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The HSE, Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs. Among the many topics being considered under this review process is the issue of supports for general practice, especially in remote rural areas. I welcome the engagement which is taking place with a view to achieving revised and modernised contractual arrangements which support the sustainable delivery of enhanced general practitioner services in local communities.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">I am raising the issue because there is a crisis in rural GP services. Given the age profile of rural GPs and the regional imbalances in it, there is genuine concern that rural GP practices are not feasible or viable and that, as doctors retire, there will be no applications. Given the age profile, there will be a steady increase in the number of rural GPs retiring. If we do not have incentives or encouragement to sustain rural GP practices, we will have difficulty maintaining services in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> Last week, there was a meeting in Bansha in south Tipperary. Dr. Marguerite Madden is retiring, and a large crowd turned out to highlight their concerns about attracting a GP to take over the practice. This is not the first time it has happened. We have had problems in Laois, Blarney in Cork a few years ago, and in Ballybunion more recently. If there were sustainability, viability and financial incentive, people would not refuse to take up these practices.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">It is one of the central issues under negotiation with the IMO. The figures are important. As of 1 November 2015, 20 GMS lists do not have a permanent GP in place, eight of which are in rural areas with populations of fewer than 1,500. However, each of the lists has either a locum GP or a neighbouring GP who has taken over the list and provides the full range of GP services to patients. Patients continue to have access to GP and primary care services. Permanent GPs are supplying over 99.9% of the GMS general practice services. This compares favourably with other countries, such as the UK, where the latest figures for 2013-14 showed a GP vacancy rate of 8% in the NHS. Of the GMS vacancies in Ireland, 50% of the 20 permanent vacancies are recent and have occurred during the past six months. It is a recent phenomenon and has more effect on urban areas of deprivation than in rural areas. Sometimes, we miss this point.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">While I highlighted the age profile of the GPs, the age profile and demographics of the remote and isolated areas where there is rural decline also show that there is a higher proportion of older people there. Given the principle of primary care, treating a person suffering from chronic illness or minor procedures in the least complex environment, the need is obviously to retain GPs in rural areas to provide primary care. This would be complementary to other primary care and community-based services. The fact that these areas have low populations does not mean there is not a high dependency on rural GP practices and primary care, particularly when one considers the demographics of these rural areas and the regional disparities between urban and rural areas but, more importantly, in the isolated areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">Again, the GP vacancy rate in England is 8% compared to 1% here. The population across the country is aging. There are exceptional circumstances in rural areas and this is why we have additional allowances and give additional leave allowances regarding employment of staff and locums. Although a substantial grant is available, it is not just about money, as we know. Maybe, people do not want to develop their careers in that type of isolation. Maybe they want to be in urban areas. This is why we need to make it more attractive. This is central to what we are doing regarding the IMO.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">I seek advice regarding the Minister's intention to address the dreadful circumstances that a not insignificant cohort of young women, and their families, face, consequent, they believe, on the Gardasil vaccination at school.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Minister for Health<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention and access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. People are assessed for eligibility for medical cards, disability or carers allowance individually. The assessment takes into account their family income and individual needs rather than a specific diagnosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> In particular, people who are suffering from the conditions raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, do not have to prove a particular cause of their symptoms to be eligible to receive treatment or access other appropriate services. Young women and their families should seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be guided by this advice in accessing appropriate services including specialist opinion where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> The HPV vaccine, which was introduced in 2010, protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults. It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school. Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the school immunisation programme and more than 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction. While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised, both nationally and at EU level. Each year in Ireland approximately 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high-risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine, and, understandably, some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughters' conditions. However, the European Medicines Agency has recently completed a review of the vaccine. The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, specifically focused on two conditions, to which I have already referred, and found no evidence of a link between the vaccine and the conditions. I want to emphasise clearly the expert findings that the HPV vaccine is a safe vaccine, and encourage all parents to have their daughters vaccinated. This will reduce the numbers of deaths from cervical cancer, head and neck cancers and other cancers in years to come.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">The Minister's reply will offer no comfort to the 130 families associated with the campaign group, REGRET. The Health Products Regulatory Authority has received 919 reports of adverse reactions and events associated with the use of Gardasil in Ireland. This could affect many more than the 130 families we know about, given that the condition can present by degrees. The 130 girls are displaying debilitating, long-term and chronic symptoms that include severe fatigue, short-term memory and concentration deterioration, food intolerances, visual disturbances, noise sensitivity, severe headaches, burning muscles and joint pain.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">Will the Minister ensure that these young women and their families have access to such benefits as disability allowance, carer's allowance, medical cards and what other appropriate supports are deemed necessary? Will the Minister and his Department look favourably on their particular circumstances and needs?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">Carer's allowance, carer's benefit, disability allowance and disability benefit are matters for the Department of Social Protection, but no one gets carer's allowance or disability benefit based on a diagnosis or a particular set of symptoms. Even if someone has a serious illness, for example, a severe cancer, he or she does not automatically get disability allowance. Everyone is assessed individually based on income and needs regardless of the cause of the illness or what he or she believes the cause to be.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> Similarly, medical card applications are assessed initially based on the income of the individual or family. The cost of people's medical treatments and their other potential needs are then taken into account, in particular for discretionary medical cards. I am sure that the Deputy knows this from his own work. It is not that anyone has an automatic entitlement to any of these benefits based on what symptoms they have or what they believe the cause of the symptoms to be. People are assessed individually initially and also on their needs. This is the way it is for every citizen, which is as it should be.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">What I would like to see of course is a situation where everyone would be entitled. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The Minister has made the exception in respect of some specific areas of need, in particular children with cancer symptoms, only in the very relatively recent past. We are not only looking at the 130 young women of whom we know - there are possibly many more - but also their families, some of which have had their lives suspended. Work and other opportunities in the fulfilment of life's hopes have been set aside in order to provide the supports and care for their daughters. It is imperative that some measure of recognition and some realistic reach-out be organised. It is not good enough just to reject their strong beliefs regarding the underlying causes of their daughters' conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin that it would be ideal if everyone had a medical card, but that is not the case. We have a means-tested system and people are assessed according to their means, not their diagnoses. In the case of discretionary medical cards, the assessment can take into account the burden of the illness and the cost of medical needs, but that is an individual assessment. After an expert group reported on this matter not too long ago, most people accepted that this was the best way forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> Regarding the adverse reactions to which the Deputy referred, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, had received 936 reports of adverse reactions and events by 27 November. It should be borne in mind that this was out of 100,000 people who had received the vaccine. The majority of the reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short-term adverse side effects for the use of any vaccine as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and swelling at the point of injection and fever. These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccine. Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents, and less commonly reported side effects from Gardasil include pain in the injected arm site, bruising, itchiness, red hives and, on occasion, wheezing. Like most vaccines, severe allergic reactions are rare.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine or vaccine has caused the observed effect, as it may also be caused by the disease being treated, a new disease that the patient has developed around the same time or by another medicine that the patient is taking. Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to ask the Minister this question. I raise this matter because I was invited a few months ago by staff, in particular those working in the accident and emergency department, to walk the corridors and meet the people who were on trolleys and chairs. I was astounded by what I saw. For the doctors, nurses and all other staff, the bottom line of the issue was bed capacity.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">Last December, I convened the emergency department task force to assist in dealing with the challenges presented by emergency department overcrowding. Significant progress has been made to date. The special delivery unit, SDU, figures showed an 8% decrease in the number of patients on trolleys in November 2015 compared with November 2014. While the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, figures for the month of November showed a 4% rise, it is significant that the nursing union's own figures also showed an 8% decrease in the second half of that month<b>. </b>This indicates that we are headed in the right direction. The numbers for November, whichever are used, are a considerable change from August when overcrowding was 20% to 40% worse than in August 2014. It is clear that the situation is not as bad as it was in the early new year when there were 500 to 600 people on trolleys every day. This morning, the number of people recorded as being on trolleys in the TrolleyGAR report was 244, with 110 people having waited for longer than nine hours. This represents a 23% reduction on this day last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The improved results that we are starting to see are the result of the implementation of the emergency task force plan, the investment of further funding of €117 million, the employment of more nurses and the opening of approximately 200 additional and previously closed beds, with a further 250 due to open in the next few weeks. In April, €74 million was provided to reduce delayed discharges, lower the waiting time for fair deal funding and provide additional transitional care beds and home care packages. In July, €18 million was allocated to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to support access to care. This included additional funding for Beaumont Hospital to enable St. Joseph's day hospital in Raheny to provide a five-day service, thus reducing presentations at the emergency department and the need for elderly people to be admitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Six of the beds at Beaumont that had been closed for refurbishment or infection control purposes during 2015 have re-opened and a further 21 beds are to re-open in December. Beaumont Hospital is one of the sites that has been the subject of particular focus, with the SDU supporting it to implement solutions. For example, the number of delayed discharges at Beaumont has decreased from 95 in November 2014 to 70 last month, thus freeing up 25 beds every day for acutely ill patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> All hospitals, including Beaumont, have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow, but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care. Last week, I co-signed the emergency department congestion escalation directive to ensure that the progress made to date on overcrowding was improved upon. The directive requires hospitals to implement their escalation plans whenever their emergency departments experience overcrowding. It is expected that this will add to the progress made to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">I welcome the fact that beds will be opened in Beaumont but we must focus on resolving the real issue. We all receive regular complaints from families, in particular those of senior citizens who find themselves on trolleys. This is especially the case at Beaumont Hospital. This situation is not acceptable. The Minister mentioned that 21 beds would be re-opened in Beaumont and six had been re-opened, amounting to 27 beds, but the staff on the ground have told me that they need approximately 80 long-term beds to resolve this regular crisis. I hope that the Minister pays attention. The professionals were objective and clinical about this issue. They told me that they needed approximately 80 beds, but the Minister has stated that they will only get 27. We must focus on this because we cannot have patients on trolleys this Christmas.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">Beaumont is an overcrowded hospital. There is no denying that. All efforts are being made to improve the situation. That the number of delayed discharges has been reduced from 95 to 70 has freed up 25 beds. This decrease needs to be sustained and we need to reduce delayed discharges further. That will involve more nursing home places and more home care, but not necessarily more acute hospital beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">The ward that was closed for refurbishment has now partially reopened. Six beds are open and a further 21 beds are yet to open.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> While I do not have the statistics for the special delivery units before me, I have the numbers from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. According to those numbers, some 586 people spent time on a trolley at Beaumont Hospital at some point in November. That can range from one or two hours to a very long period of time. The figure for November 2014 was 729. This means that based on the numbers from the nurses' union, there was a 20% reduction from November 2014 to November 2015. Clearly, we need to do even better than that. I remind Deputy McGrath that there are plenty of examples of hospitals where we have put in lots of extra beds but it has not worked. Additional bed capacity is not the only factor that gives rise to hospital overcrowding - if only it were that easy - because there are many other factors at play.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">If what the Minister is saying is the case, I want to know why the doctors and nurses in Beaumont Hospital are telling me that the reality is otherwise. I would like to mention two appalling cases in my constituency that recently highlighted the need to deal with this issue. A 90 year old woman ended up on a trolley after arriving at the accident and emergency department. Her family was treated appallingly. I am sending the details of that case to the Minister. I would appreciate it if he could look at them. The family in question does not want to go public. The second case relates to a 20 year old man with cerebral palsy who is PEG-fed, non-verbal and 5 stone in weight. There was nobody in the radiology department to deal with his needs at 6 o'clock on Saturday, 31 October last. His family members were so distressed that they had to take him home. When they came back on Sunday, 1 November, there was nobody in the radiology department again. They had to take him home again on the second day. When they came in on the Monday, they eventually got to see a doctor in the radiology department. It is not acceptable for a young man with cerebral palsy to be treated in such a way in any hospital in 2015. I ask the Minister to focus on the provision of proper services to people at Beaumont Hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual cases. I do not have all the information on them. I might never have all the details, for reasons of patient confidentiality and for other reasons. If the Deputy wants to make those details available to the chief executive officer of the hospital, I will make sure the matter is looked into appropriately. He is not the only person who knows doctors and nurses in Beaumont Hospital. I do too. I have visited the hospital on two occasions and the emergency department on one occasion. The doctors and nurses there acknowledge that many factors give rise to overcrowding. It is not just about bed capacity; it is also about delayed discharges, length of stay and other issues. In theory, a hospital in which the average patient spends eight days needs twice as many beds as a hospital in which the average patient spends four days. In practice, it needs to reduce its average length of stay per patient. A reduction of half a day in the average length of stay in a hospital can free up a huge number of beds. Many factors other than bed capacity contribute to overcrowding. On a bad day, there can be 30 or 40 people on trolleys at Beaumont Hospital. If it were as simple as providing extra beds, this problem should be solved by a reduction of 25 in the number of delayed discharges and the opening of 25 beds. That will not happen, however. There are many other factors at play. All of them need to be worked on as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">The Government is working to ensure long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are reduced. It is focussing on additional resources and capacity to carry out this surgery. Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people. Additional funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts, including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, as well as an anaesthetist and support staff, at Crumlin. Capital funding has been provided for a new theatre on that site to expand theatre capacity further. This theatre will be open in the spring. In the interim, patients from Crumlin are being transferred to other hospitals in which capacity is available, where that is clinically appropriate. Temple Street Hospital has taken some cases. Cappagh Hospital is being used for older kids. Patients are also being transferred to Tallaght Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic, where it is being paid for privately. Recently, external capacity has been identified at the UK Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore near London. These measures have more than doubled capacity for this surgery for patients on the Crumlin waiting list in 2015. Two consultant orthopaedic surgeons have recently been appointed at Galway University Hospital to support the spinal service there. In the short term, the authorities in Galway are actively working to assign dedicated beds to support this service and exploring the potential to refer some patients out for surgery. The HSE is continuing to work with the children’s hospital group, the Saolta hospital group and the individual hospitals to identify all options to increase capacity further to improve access times for surgery.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">The Minister will be aware that there is no national screening service for the onset of scoliosis. The curvature of the spine is probably first observed by a general practitioner or family member. Waiting lists and waiting times are increasing significantly. I have been advised by an orthopaedic surgeon that immediate intervention is required beyond the age of 16. It is next to pointless for an acute intervention to address the progressive nature of scoliosis. Children have been languishing on waiting lists for over three years. The interventions they are waiting for would not be considered lightly by families. It is a serious operation. What are the Minister's plans to accelerate the waiting times? It appears that the waiting times in the HSE west area are out of kilter with those elsewhere. There is a three-year wait for an intervention to address the chronic and acute nature of this condition.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">That is the only solution. There are barriers to that. Appropriately qualified consultant orthopaedic surgeons and theatre nurses need to be recruited. There needs to be sufficient theatre time and theatre space. I met the consultants in Crumlin who are the specialists in this area quite some time ago. They agreed that a whole new theatre was needed in Crumlin to provide additional capacity there. That is now under construction. Work is being done to staff the new theatre, which should be open in the new year. It will allow us to double capacity for children's orthopaedic surgery in Crumlin. This development is taking place even though an entire new hospital will be built in a few years time. The situation is so serious that we cannot wait for the new hospital to be completed. That is why the new theatre is being built. Efforts are under way to staff it. In the meantime, other hospitals that can help out are helping out. Temple Street Hospital, for example, is taking three patients. Stanmore Hospital near London is taking patients. That is important too. Some cases are being sent out privately to be done in Blackrock. In regard to Galway, I have asked my Department-----</p>

            <p eId="para_58">I would like to speak about the human cost of not intervening. This is an intervention. I am aware of the case of a young woman who used to be a grade A student, but has had to miss 70 days of school in this academic year. At the age of 16, she is a user of the mental health services in Galway as a consequence of having spent three years languishing on a waiting list. I ask the Minister to ensure a national screening programme is introduced to enable us to intervene at an earlier juncture of somebody's life. If young people who are dealing with the scourge of scoliosis get the interventions they require, they will have an opportunity to live the most successful lives they can under these circumstances. Greater investment in taking people off waiting lists and getting them to Crumlin will be required to facilitate such interventions. The Minister referred to Crumlin, Cappagh and Blackrock, but I am talking about the case of a young woman in the west of Ireland. The Minister and I are both familiar with the case. This young woman, who used to be a grade A student, has collapsed while waiting for an intervention. It is completely unacceptable that HSE west has not made progress with this case to ensure she has an opportunity to live a successful and equal life like any other child of her age. She is not being given such an opportunity as a consequence of the mismanagement by HSE west.</p>

I have asked my officials to discuss the issue with the HSE and the children's hospital group. Any time a low volume of surgery is being done, there are concerns about that and about whether any surgeon should be doing only a few types of operations every year. It is something I have asked my officials to investigate. As I said, everything is being done to double capacity for this type of surgery this year. London, Blackrock and other hospitals are being used. Everything that can be done, within reason, is being done to address this very serious problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I am mindful of the decision of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, membership to initiate industrial action later this month. I want to establish what steps the Minister is taking to address the real crisis in our hospital network. It presents in particular in the context of accident and emergency departments but is not confined to those units in terms of staff recruitment, bed capacity and other matters.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_65">The HSE will seek to minimise the impact of any industrial action on patients in the seven emergency departments where strike action is proposed. Hospital management will agree contingency arrangements with staff to ensure that adequate resources are provided during the two-hour period of industrial action at each site on 15 December. The strike is avoidable and management and nursing union representatives can reach agreement before then with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery. I understand the pressure and frustration that has given rise to the strike ballot.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> Recruitment of additional nurses and consultants is a subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals. Recruitment campaigns are under way in Ireland and abroad. The HSE staff census returns for the end of October 2015 show that 754 more nurses are employed in the public health services than this time last year. The number of consultants has increased by 393 since March 2011, when this Government came into office, and the number of non-consultant hospital doctors has increased by 1,007, the highest number ever.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> We have a plan to address emergency department overcrowding, which was developed by the emergency department task force. The plan benefitted from considerable input by staff representatives, including the nurses' unions. The measures in the plan are currently being implemented and are beginning to show results. Additional funding of €18 million has been provided to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to improve access to care. This is supporting hospitals to reopen closed beds and to add more beds. Some 197 hospital beds have opened nationally since October, another 38 due to open in the next two weeks and another 200 will open in subsequent weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> As I mentioned, HSE figures show an 8% reduction in overcrowding this November compared to last. The INMO figures also show significant improvement in the second half of November. This contrasts with the position during the summer, when overcrowding was 20% to 40% worse compared to last year. Recent progress is definitely going in the right direction and is a big improvement on the start of this year, when there were 500 to 600 people on trolleys on some mornings. For example, at 8 a.m. today, the number of people waiting on trolleys was 244 and 110 patients were waiting for more than nine hours. This is 23% lower than this time last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> I recognise the continued difficulties being experienced in emergency department and the enormous contribution staff make in meeting the needs of patients. Progress is being made but this needs to be sustained in each hospital and nationally through the full implementation of the emergency department task force recommendations. Additional nurses, doctors and consultants are being appointed. The waiting time for the fair deal scheme, for example, has been reduced from 11 weeks to three to four weeks and the number of patients whose discharges are delayed has been reduced by over 270, which alone frees up 270 beds every day. New acute hospital beds have been introduced for the first time in years. Given the progress that is emerging and the further development under way, I hope that the proposed action can be avoided.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">Whatever about the proposed action of the INMO, the crisis continues and is likely to continue until such time as we properly resource our acute hospital network. I refer to the Supplementary Estimate the Minister is bringing forward and which, I understand, will be brought before the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the coming week. Has the Minister built into that Supplementary Estimate a sum of money that will address the current potential for the delivery of additional staff and bed capacity up to the end of 2015? The Supplementary Estimate is particular to this year, in terms of the budgetary provision. Can the Minister tell us whether he has built into it provision for particular steps to address this crisis?</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> I refer to 15 December, which is imminent. What engagement, if any, has the Minister had since the ballot taken by the INMO? Has he sought such a meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_72">As the Deputy knows, the Supplementary Estimate of €665 million refers to this year. Built into that is the provision for the winter initiative to open additional beds, if we can find and pay the required staff, and to keep fair deal waiting times at between two and four weeks. Its purpose is also to ensure we can keep providing the additional 180,000 additional home care packages and home help hours provided this year. The short answer to the Deputy's question is that all of those measures are built in to the Supplementary Estimate.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> I met the general secretary of the INMO on Monday. We have spoken on the phone since then. I met the INMO emergency department nurses committee, at its request, a couple of weeks ago. The current position is that talks have begun at the Workplace Relations Commission, which has now intervened in the matter, and that is the best place for these matters to be resolved, as they almost always are.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">In terms of the Supplementary Estimate, could the Minister indicate the breakdown in terms of how the overspend will be addressed, as he would regard it, up to this point in 2015, and the additional moneys he has secured? I presume that is the case in order to address the deficiencies, in terms of resourcing, in the numbers of consultants doctors, nurses, midwives and other professional inputs and bed capacity. Can the Minister tell us what the overspend is, as against the add-on moneys, to bring us up to the end of this month?</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> On engagement with the INMO, does the Minister have any expectation of revisiting the decision already taken or in terms of any of the measures he is currently working on? Are they being viewed in any way as sufficient to allow for a re-evaluation of the position by the INMO in advance of 15 December?</p>

            <p eId="para_76">The questions the Deputy asked on the Supplementary Estimate are entirely reasonable but the question he put down did not ask about it at all. I did not bring the big binder of figures that I will have with me when we discuss it at a committee meeting next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> It is important to bear in mind that the Supplementary Estimate includes a number of different things. It includes some one-off measures that will not be repeated next year, such as the cost of the symphysiotomy payment scheme, the €50 million waiting lists initiative, the extra payday that occurred this year compared to last year and a number of policy decisions made during the year. These were not overruns. Rather, they were decisions made by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I, in conjunction with Government colleagues, to put more resources into the fair deal, to spend a little bit more on GP care for those aged under six, to bring in the diabetes cycle of care and open additional beds in hospitals. </p>
            <p eId="para_78"> There are different aspects to the Supplementary Estimate and it does not involve just overruns. There were overruns in the cost of medicines because more medicines were used and prescribed than we thought. The reduction in the number of medical cards as a result of the improving economy was not as great as we thought it would be.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">6. <b>Deputy Joan Collins</b> asked the <b>Minister for Health</b> further to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 16 of 22 October 2015 in which he stated that he had put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient, day-case and outpatient treatment of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end, why there are 13 patients waiting for spinal surgery, two of whom have come to this Deputy's attention, who are waiting since July 2014 in Galway University Hospital; his views on whether scoliosis patients with 70% to 80% spinal curvature should be subject to these waiting times; if there should be a maximum permissible waiting time of three to six months for these patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_86">I have raised this issue over a number of months, going back to last year and even before then.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">I am very involved in Crumlin Hospital. As it is in my constituency I have known many patients who have gone through it, particularly when there were cutbacks in 2010 and 2011. At the time, the then-Minister, Deputy James Reilly, said he would defend scoliosis patients and ensure the waiting lists would be reduced. I ask the Minister to reply to my question and then I will come back to address something he said earlier.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_53" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_88">The Government is working to ensure that long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are reduced. The focus is on additional resources and capacity so that more operations can be carried out every year. I have been assured by University Hospital Galway it is working to ensure that the necessary resources and arrangements are in place to address the needs of patients with scoliosis and to urgently tackle waiting lists. These include appropriate bed availability, access to diagnostics, purchase of specialist spinal equipment and access to theatre. Within the last three months, two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, comprising one replacement and one additional post, have been appointed at University Hospital Gaway to support this service. In the short term, Galway is working to assign five dedicated beds to support the service and when the new ward block which is under construction is completed, this will increase to eight dedicated beds. Unfortunately, the block will not be finished for approximately 18 months. I understand that there are seven patients at Galway who are currently breaching the maximum permissible waiting time of 15 months and that the hospital is working with the special delivery unit, or SDU, to secure their early treatment, including examining the potential to refer these patients out for surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> In addition to the measures underway in Galway, significant progress is being made in respect of those awaiting scoliosis surgery at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin. The volume of such surgeries for patients on the Crumlin list has been doubled this year. As such, it is hoped that twice as many operations will be carried out this year than were carried out last year. The HSE's acute hospitals division is continuing to work with the children's hospital group, the Saolta hospital group and individual hospitals to provide guidance and support and, where appropriate, to engage with all parties who can contribute to improving access to spinal surgery.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">There were nine patients waiting for scoliosis operations in University Hospital Galway in May this year and only one had surgery. We are now told that there are 13 patients on the list and that three have had a surgery since. That is not acceptable. I know two people who do not mind me saying their names and in fact have asked me to do so. Aisling has a 70% curvature of her spine and has been on the waiting list since July 2014. She is still waiting for an operation. She says she can hardly breathe and that her organs are under a great deal of stress yet she is still waiting. What is happening there? These are two people I know. The other person is a young girl named Sophie who has an 80% curvature of her spine. I received a note from her mother the other day to say that Sophie has been prescribed anti-depressants and continues to worsen. For two weeks, she has been out of school where she is an honours student. She is still waiting for surgery. This is not acceptable. I expect that all the patients who have been on the list for longer than three or six months should be sent to other hospitals or, as the Minister said, to London or wherever the operation can be carried out. That is why I have asked the question. The consultant is available to do it.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">We discussed this on an earlier question. I am not sure if the Deputy was here. As I said, the constraints in carrying out complex surgery depend on a number of things including theatre time being available, theatre nurses being available, an appropriately qualified consultant orthopaedic surgeon being available to carry out the operation and a number of other factors. What is being done is a doubling of the number of surgeries being carried out, if possible. Other hospitals are taking patients. Temple Street, for example, has taken three patients by moving some lists to Saturday working. The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore, London, has been asked to help out and it carried out an out-patient clinic in Crumlin on Friday, 27 November 2015. The clinic had 15 patients and Stanmore accepted 11, five of whom are long waiters. There were two families who decided not to progress with surgery on the basis of second opinions while two will be followed up with outpatient appointments in Crumlin. This accounts for the remaining four long waiters greater than 15 months. The opportunity to send patients to Stanmore with its shorter waiting times allows Crumlin to free up theatre capacity for complex patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">There is no excuse for a person waiting 17 months for an operation. It is 15 months for Aisling who had to get rods taken out of her back previously. Since then, she has been waiting for surgery. She is in terrible pain. The Minister cannot stand over this. He must address University Hospital Galway, albeit not so much Crumlin where issues have moved on and he is trying to deal with it. I want to be able to put down a question in one month's time on University Hospital Galway to which the Minister will reply that eight or nine of the 13 patients have been addressed and that no patient will have to wait for a scoliosis surgery for more than three months. Anything else is unacceptable. The Minister is getting away with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_96"> I am advised from Galway that within the last three months, two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, comprising one replacement and one additional post, have been appointed at University Hospital Gaway. While the hospital has limited capacity to undertake the elective aspect of the service, it is actively working to develop the elements required to support the service including in-patient beds, high-end equipment, theatre capacity and staffing from within existing resources. In the short term, Galway is working to assign five dedicated beds to support this service. When the new ward block which is under construction is completed, this will increase to eight dedicated beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> There are ten patients in Galway awaiting scoliosis spinal surgery of whom seven have been waiting for more than 15 months. As I say, the hospital is working with the SDU to explore the potential to refer these patients to another hospital for surgery whether in Dublin or, potentially, overseas if that is an option.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">I ask the Minister for an update on the roll-out of primary care centres, in particular two centres at Coolock-Darndale and Edenmore, respectively.

            <p eId="para_100">The development of primary care remains central to the Government's objective of delivering a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health care service at community level. This involves shifting the balance of care from a hospital-centred service to one located in the community to enable people easily to access a broad spectrum of services at local level. The development of primary care centres is taking place through a combination of direct build by the State, public private partnerships, or PPPs, and operational leasing. The facilities will house GP and community nursing teams and offer additional services including physiotherapy, social work, counselling and occupational therapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> The Coolock-Darndale primary care centre is one of 14 locations to be delivered under a single PPP project. Following a detailed tender evaluation process, the National Development Finance Agency announced the Prime-Balfour Beatty consortium as the preferred tenderer in May 2015. Subject to successful completion of financial and contractual arrangements, it is expected that construction work will commence in early 2016 and that the primary care centres, including the Coolock-Darndale centre, will be delivered during 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> With regard to the proposed primary care centre at Edenmore, the HSE proposes to use the operational lease mechanism. In November 2014, the HSE sought expressions of interest from interested parties for primary care centres to be delivered using the operational lease mechanism. Edenmore was one of 73 locations advertised and expressions of interest were received for this location. Following the third stage selection process, heads of terms have recently been agreed with the selected provider. In line with the normal property approval protocol of the HSE, the project will be submitted to the HSE's property review group for approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> A major programme to develop primary care centres has been considerably advanced and I look forward in the period ahead to further developments, including those at Coolock and Darndale and in Edenmore. I hope this is of help to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I thank the Minister of State for the response. When does she expect the Edenmore centre to come on stream? She mentioned construction for the Coolock-Darndale centre specifically being delivered in early 2017, but what is the status of the Edenmore centre? What level of review has been done in respect of those primary care centres which have actually come on stream? Are they carrying out their functions well and are there plans to take further pressure off hospitals directly?</p>
            <p eId="para_105">In terms of the original plan, what percentage of what the Minister of State said she would deliver has been delivered at this stage? In Beaumont Hospital INMO members will work to rule on 16 December. It is very frightening. They are doing great work in a hospital which is hugely understaffed.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">The number of primary care centres being built is ahead of profile and the process is working extremely well. We are proposing to build even more under an operational lease which also has to go through a process. The issue is not just about buildings, it is also about ensuring GPs in a certain area are prepared to co-operate and avail of the facility. Then and only then will other services be provided in the centre. A lot of preparatory work has to be done in advance of providing the buildings. There are some areas where that co-operation is not forthcoming, for example, where GPs have already formed a co-operative and put substantial moneys into their own practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">The only way hospitals will have respite is, for instance, if various chronic illnesses are treated in primary care centres. That should give us some breathing space. Minor surgeries will be performed in primary care centres more often in 2016 than in 2015. There were 20 in 2015 and the proposal is to have 80 in 2016. There will always be vacancies for nurses, junior doctors and consultants. The difficulty is in attracting people into the system. We had to reduce the number employed and everyone knows why - the economy had collapsed - but we are trying to reverse that trend. There will, however, always be vacancies within acute units and hospitals. People who qualify like to travel, but we are hoping that once they have got the travel bug out of their system, they will come home and see Ireland as an attractive place in which to work.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. While most GPs provide phlebotomy services for their medical card and GP visit card patients without charge, I am aware that there have been instances where some GPs have charged such patients for these services. It is not acceptable for patients in these categories to be subject to a charge for procedures associated with routine diagnosis and treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> The HSE, as the body which contracts GPs for the provision of services for GMS and GP visit card patients, has written on a number of occasions to contract holders, most recently in March 2014, clarifying the position on phlebotomy services. All written complaints about GPs charging for such services have been investigated by the HSE. In any case where a patient has been charged by his or her GP for phlebotomy services, the HSE will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of the amount concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> The Department of Health and the HSE are cognisant of the need for a new agreed contract with GPs that will help modernise the health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector. Negotiations are under way with the Irish Medical Organisation. The appropriate arrangements for phlebotomy services and to deal with differences of interpretation will be considered in this context. The process also provides an opportunity to ensure maximum clarity on the scope and nature of the service to be provided, including the taking of blood for diagnostic purposes or in connection with the treatment or monitoring of an ongoing condition. Notwithstanding these engagements, the contractual position is as outlined by the Deputy and the HSE has and will continue to take action where medical card or GP visit card patients are charged inappropriately.</p>

            <p eId="para_138">In the past eight years a general moratorium on recruitment and promotion, coupled with an employment control framework, has contributed to a fall in employment across the public health sector and the wider public service. Arising from budget 2015, restrictions on the employment of additional staff were eased in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> In December 2014 I convened the emergency department task force to provide a focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by overcrowding. In 2015, €117 million in additional funding was allocated specifically to address overcrowding in emergency departments, including through the ongoing recruitment of front-line staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">It is recognised that the solution to the problem of emergency department overcrowding is to be found through putting in place alternatives to hospital admission and services which facilitate earlier discharge, as well as in addressing the efficiency and capacity of hospitals in delivering acute treatment. Accordingly, the solution requires improvements in both the wider hospital beyond the emergency department, as well as in primary and social care and community services.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> Health Service Executive figures show there was a 8% reduction in overcrowding in November compared to November last year. While the INMO, Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, figures show a 4% increase, they also show a significant improvement in the second half of November. This contrasts with the position throughout the year when we were running 24% ahead of the figure in the preceding year. This morning there were 244 patients on trolleys, 110 for more than nine hours. That is 23% lower than the figure this day last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> A total of 4,643 staff members have been recruited by hospital groups in the past year. They include replacement staff. The increase in the number of whole-time equivalent staff during the same period was approximately 2,500. Of the staff recruited, 254 have been assigned to emergency departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> The HSE is finalising its national service plan for 2016, meaning that it is not possible at this stage to predict the additional emergency department staff numbers for 2016. However, hospitals have authority to deploy staff in the most effective way possible within agreed funding levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">I thank the Minister for his reply. I note an additional 41 nurses have been appointed to University Hospital Galway since October 2014. An additional 146 staff were recruited overall to the hospital, including 29 non-consultant hospital doctors, six consultants and 19 allied health professionals. Because of overcrowding and the concerns about the emergency department in the hospital which hit the headlines during Leaders’ Questions yesterday, I welcome the Minister’s statement on proceeding to design stage in 2016 for a new emergency department at the hospital. Will he provide more clarity in this regard? As the Taoiseach said yesterday, the facilities are not fit for purpose. Having visited the emergency department recently, I know that the Minister agrees with the Taoiseach’s statement yesterday.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">I do not have the detailed staff figures for University Hospital Galway. In the Saolta group there has been an increase of 689 staff this year, 38 of whom were assigned to emergency departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> Many emergency departments are old and out of date and there has been considerable investment in them in recent years. There is a new emergency department in Wexford. The one in Kilkenny has just been completed and will be opened in the next few months. A new emergency department in the Mater Hospital was opened in 2013. Construction is under way on the new emergency department in Limerick. There is an extended emergency department in Tallaght hospital. The emergency department in Clonmel is being upgraded, while an extended department is under construction in Mullingar. The planning application for the national children's hospital new emergency department and satellite centres is before An Bord Pleanála. It is fair to say that in the past five years there has been more investment than ever in new and extended emergency departments. The difficulty is that much of the health infrastructure remains old, some of it is 200 years old. One cannot replace all of it overnight and it will take some time to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_147"> It is acknowledged that even if there was no overcrowding in Galway, the emergency department is out of date and needs to be replaced. The intention is to proceed to design and planning stage in 2016 to allow work to proceed in the years to come. Just because it is not specifically mentioned in the six-year capital plan does not mean that it is not going to happen. The capital plan refers to national projects and programmes, not individual wards or departments in hospitals across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_148">I welcome the clarification, as there has been misinformation or slightly skewed information. I welcome the Minister’s intention to proceed to design stage in 2016 for a new emergency department in Galway. Obviously, there is a nursing shortfall, which I understand is worldwide. Will the Minister clarify the provision of additional facilities in Galway such as the 75-bed ward which is under construction, the 30 extra beds planned for the old physio ward which are due for delivery in early spring and the 14 beds to be provided in Merlin Park University Hospital in May? These additional facilities will help to ease overcrowding in the coming months. The emergency department is still a significant issue and the staff in it do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">Specifically on the position in Galway, I do not have the official figures, but the most recent figures from the INMO showed that there were 480 patients on trolleys at some point during November in University Hospital Galway, down from 536 in the same month last year. The additional beds in Merlin Park University Hospital probably helped in that regard. More is being done. Up to 30 beds will be provided in the old physio and social work department which is under construction. I am hoping it will be opened in December. If not, it will be opened in the new year. The new 75-bed block is under construction and will mainly consist of individual beds in individual rooms, providing for a much more modern standard of hospital accommodation. It will be completed in 2017. It is intended to proceed to planning and design stage for the new emergency department in 2016. As I said, even if there was no overcrowding in the emergency department in Galway, the facility is out of date and needs to be replaced and modernised.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Alan Kelly)<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">I am pleased to inform the House of amendments made by Seanad Éireann to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015. It is a timely topic as governments around the word are seeking to negotiate a new climate agreement in Paris - I will be there myself quite soon - which will put us all on track to limit carbon emissions and help countries, both developed and developing, to accelerate their transition to low-carbon and sustainable economies and prepare for the inevitable impacts of a changing climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">I will be heading to Paris for the high level session of the conference on Sunday and I do not underestimate the challenges next week to securing agreement on what is probably the most significant international conference on the future of our planet and the quality of life of our children and grandchildren. However, all of our hopes cannot rest on the Paris outcome alone. We can show leadership through Government, businesses and citizens taking actions to reduce our emissions here at home and blazing a trail for others to learn from and follow. </p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Deputies will recall that the Bill completed all Stages in the House on 8 October, having been amended in several important ways on Report Stage. The Bill then progressed to Seanad Éireann where debate proved positive and fruitful. In particular, on Committee Stage in that House, a number of matters were raised that were shown to warrant further scrutiny. On deliberation by me and the Ministers of State, Deputies Coffey and Phelan, and with the support of the Government, agreement was reached on Report Stage in the Seanad to make nine separate amendments to the Bill. These amendments achieve three important goals. </p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Amendment No. 1 provides that each successive national mitigation plan will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than just Dáil Éireann. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 provide that each successive national adaptation framework will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than just Dáil Éireann. Amendments Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, provide that the annual transition statement will be presented by the relevant Ministers to both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than just Dáil Éireann. I consider these amendments to be sensible and desirable changes to an already ambitious Bill. They will enable the input of Seanad Éireann to be heard fully by Ministers and the Government as we move forward with our mitigation and adaptation policy measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> With these changes, which I hope the House can join with me in confirming, I believe it is now time to pass this historic Bill into law so that we can build on the preparatory work already under way and engage fully with the all important implementation phase. This includes, not least, the development of the State's first national mitigation plan which will chart a course towards meeting our immediate greenhouse gas emission mitigation targets up to 2020 as well as looking towards 2030 and 2050. Moreover, implementation will also involve development of the first statutory national adaptation framework and associated sectoral climate change adaptation plans so that we can plan and prepare ourselves for the inevitable impacts of climate change over the coming years and decades. </p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I thank the House for all the debates on this important topic to date.</p>

It is probably the biggest challenge facing humanity but there is just me and the Minister in here to discuss the amendments from the Seanad, which are virtually meaningless in terms of the content of this Bill. Their only purpose is to give the Seanad a role in some of the toothless measures proposed in the original Bill. Given the focus of the world is on what is happening in Paris at the moment, Ireland stands out as some sort of throwback.

          <p eId="para_179">Yes, we will, because all the amendments are related to the heart of this Bill and how this Government proposes to fulfil its responsibility to reach our climate change targets. That is what this Bill is about and the amendments are dealing with giving the Seanad a role in that regard. I would, therefore, like to make points about it. The problem is that, with these amendments, the Seanad is trying to buy into a process but the Government's Bill is light on targets, action and substance. The Government speaks about reductions in emissions but, in actual fact, there is no plan on how to achieve them and there are no binding targets. The Seanad seeks to involve itself in the process but the process is a hollow one.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> We have to put this in context. Ireland currently emits 75% more greenhouse gases than China on a <i>per capita</i> basis. We are the second worse <i>per capita </i>polluter in Europe after Poland. Total greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland, which has a population of 4.5 million, amount to more than the total for almost 400 million of the planet's poorest people. It is an absolute disgrace to have to listen to the commentary of the Taoiseach in Paris this weekend and comments of other colleagues of the Minister, such as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney. Some 30% of Ireland's emissions come from agriculture but the agriculture sector is, in essence, getting a free pass from the Government. The Seanad seeks to bind itself into the oversight provisions but it is overseeing nothing. Overseeing a plan, when it does not have any targets, is an unachievable goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> We heard more truths come out in Paris. The Minister's Government has consistently been in denial about these issues but it is worse than denial. It is a downright false presentation of facts. When presented with the reality by the EU Commission that Ireland was not going to meet its 2020 targets, Brian Hayes MEP is on the record as saying the complete opposite and that Ireland was on course to reach its targets. This was the absolute opposite of what was contained in the report. Within hours of his saying that earlier this year, the Minister came out and admitted ahead of the Paris talks that it was no secret that we were not going to meet our 2020 targets. </p>
          <p eId="para_182"> The Minister then went on to assert, incorrectly, I might add, that while we will not meet our targets, we are on track towards achieving them. Evidence from the EPA flagrantly contradicts what the Minister is on the record as having said. The EPA states that Ireland is not, in line with the climate action and low carbon development plan, on track towards decarbonising the economy in the long term and that it will face steep challenges post-2020 unless further policies and measures over and above those envisaged between now and 2020 are put in place. I cannot understand how the Seanad would look at the Bill, see the reality of the situation, which clearly spells out that we are not going to achieve our targets, and decide that the only amendments it sees fit to make are toothless ones that give it an oversight role. </p>
          <p eId="para_183"> We are not doing anything near enough in terms of climate justice and other measures. It is a real indictment of the Government's handling of the issue that it appointed Professor John FitzGerald to the expert advisory council on the climate. Professor FitzGerald is an able person but he is an economist. He is not a climate change expert. This sets the tone for how the Government views the issue and demonstrates it is not at all at the races in terms of this global challenge. It is frightening that Professor FitzGerald said it is our grandchildren and great-grandchildren who will benefit from this Bill, something which was echoed by the Minister a minute ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Minister is way behind on this. It is our lives and those of our children which will be impacted by this crisis. This is urgent but the Government has done nothing to recognise that climate change is already real. Its consequences are not something that we will see in 100 years' time; parts of this globe are already experiencing the consequences. The climate disaster is the biggest contributor to the refugee situation which will only get worse in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Thousands of people demonstrated on the streets of Dublin last weekend on this issue. They were part of a global movement of hundreds of thousands of people who are calling on world leaders to put a stop to this madness. It is absolutely reprehensible that the French Government chose to use the excuse of terrorism to lock down legitimate protest activity in Paris when it had no problem with other social gatherings in the city. Sadly, what we saw was an abuse of power to curtail democratic debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Ireland is sadly wanting on this issue. The only positive is that we are on the eve of an election and hopefully we will get a new Government which will treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves. This Government has been very poor in its handling of these matters.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_187">I wonder what it is that the Seanad will oversee because I have had great difficulty in overseeing these matters from an Opposition perspective, even though one of my roles in this House is to hold the Government to account. We have been told that our national ambition is stated in the sectoral plans in areas like agriculture, transport and construction. Will the Seanad get sight of those sectoral plans earlier? I cannot see any ambition here. In fact, what I see is the very opposite of ambition. This Bill deals with climate inaction. It seems that there was a deliberate design on the part of the Government over the last few years to get us to a point where we would plead a special case for ourselves, as a very rich nation <i>vis-à-vis</i> very poor nations, in terms of what should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Regardless of whether it is the Seanad or the Dáil which oversees this, the EPA has already told us that we will not reach the 2020 targets. Indeed, the Taoiseach has said that we will not reach the 2030 targets. Recent decisions made on transport, for example, are the very opposite of what we should do if we want to reduce the number of car journeys taken. The take up rate for the retrofit grants to improve the energy efficiency of homes has plummeted. These are just two areas in which we could be doing far more. The Government is taking a very dishonest approach to the agriculture sector by telling it that it will not be required to do anything in terms of mitigation because the Government will plead its case. We could do more in terms of developing carbon sinks in bogland and planting more trees but there is no avoiding the fact that under the 2020 Food Harvest plan, the national herd will grow by approximately 300,000 which is not sustainable. The Government's arguments are not sustainable in this area. The sectoral plans must be produced speedily so that the Seanad and Dáil can examine them to determine whether they will be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I was disgusted by what the Taoiseach said in Paris this week. I was ashamed that Ireland was at that conference, pleading a special case. Earlier this year I met some French politicians at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht who were totally shocked when they realised there were no targets set down in this legislation. As I said during the Second Stage debate, if one sets out on a journey, one ought to know where one is going but we have no real guidance in this Bill. Everything is just pushed off into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> It is ironic that we are dealing with the closing stages of this Bill in the same week that the global conference on climate change is taking place in Paris. We have been very badly exposed in terms of our approach to this issue, which is fundamentally dishonest. By not doing something about climate change we are avoiding our moral obligations and not taking the leadership role that we should take in the context of climate justice. The Government is not being honest with people in this country because it is not pointing out what will happen when we miss our targets. Hard cash will have to be paid over when we miss our targets and taxpayers will have to come up with that hard cash. If people saw the full picture, the debate on this would be much more honest, including the debate with those sectors which must play a part in the context of mitigation. It is not acceptable for one sector to be told that it does not have to play a role in this regard. There are many in that sector who know full well that things will have to change for them and they are looking for leadership, which they are certainly not getting from this Government. What the Government is doing at the Paris conference is a complete embarrassment and no amount of additional oversight from Seanad Éireann will make a whit of a difference because this is one of the weakest pieces of climate legislation which we are, disgracefully, enacting at a time when the world is supposed to be taking the Paris conference seriously. This Government is not taking it seriously and has not done so during the current Dáil. This has been a very dishonest enterprise.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_195">In page 5, line 8, after “Docklands” to insert “Oversight and”.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">On Committee Stage, various Deputies expressed concern that the successor to the Docklands Council, which is the Docklands Consultative Forum, did not have an oversight role in the future regeneration of the docklands. I recognise that its predecessor, the Docklands Council, was an invaluable conduit for inputs to the authority's policy and work on matters pertaining to this area. It was made up of members from the business community, publicly elected representatives for the area, nominees of bodies and agencies with a remit in docklands and, most crucially, members of representative bodies of residents. The continuation of this level of input will be a vital resource for Dublin City Council in its future stewardship of this part of the city. I was happy to accept the concerns expressed by the Deputies on Committee Stage and, accordingly, I propose via this amendment to recognise the oversight role of the forum by changing the name of the Docklands Consultative Forum to the Docklands Oversight and Consultative Forum by amending the Long Title of the Bill. Amendment No. 7 follows the same rationale as that outlined for amendment No. 1. I propose to amend section 37 to reflect the change of the name to the Docklands Oversight and Consultative Forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> With regard to amendments Nos. 14 and 15, when outlining my reasoning for amendments Nos. 1 and 7, I touched on the concerns of local Deputies who wished that the proposed forum for docklands have a broader remit than first envisaged, which I was happy to accommodate. The amendments to section 49 will further strengthen that commitment. Amendment No. 14 clarifies that the title of the annual report of the Docklands Oversight and Consultative Forum may be referenced as the "DOCF annual report". Amendment No. 15 proposes to amend the previous provision under the Bill to now require that the annual report is submitted to the Minister and, thereafter, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, instead of the report just being submitted to Dublin City Council. This ensures a further level of oversight while also opening up the work of the forum to the scrutiny of both Houses. I am happy to facilitate the future work of the forum in this manner. I propose that amendments Nos. 1, 7, 14 and 15 be accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">I thank all Members for their contributions and comments on the various Stages of this important legislation and for taking the time to speak on the Bill, which will lead to the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the transfer of its functions to Dublin City Council. It is difficult to overstate the importance of docklands in the economic recovery of our capital and the nation as a whole. Already, applications for major developments have been received under the SDZ for the docklands and the future development of the remaining docklands area will see an integrative approach which is aligned with the Dublin city development plan 2016-22.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> It is pivotal that the future strategic development of all aspects of the docklands is led by Dublin City Council and that the development is executed in a manner that is sympathetic to the overall planning parameters of the city. The commitment of Dublin City Council to the area can be gauged from the establishment of a dedicated docklands unit within Dublin City Council which is fully resourced, with access to personnel across a diverse range of skills and disciplines. In order to ensure a smooth transition during this time, those personnel have already been engaged in managing the wind-down of the authority leading up to the dissolution and will continue to be so for many years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Under the DDDA, the voices and concerns of residents, business interests and agencies with an involvement in docklands were channelled via the Docklands Council to the authority. It was essential that, post-dissolution, those voices would continue to contribute to the future shaping of their environment. Provision was made in the Bill for a Docklands Consultative Forum as a successor to the Docklands Council. On Committee Stage, I was made aware by Deputies of concerns that this forum might not have had adequate scope to allow for the desired level of input by the community. I am pleased to say I have amended the Bill accordingly. The forum will now be known as the Docklands Oversight and Consultative Forum and, furthermore, its annual report will be laid before the houses of the Oireachtas for the scrutiny of Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> One of the other concerns raised during this process related to a perceived failure to nurture and preserve the rich heritage of docklands. This heritage, reflecting its industrial, maritime and trading past, can be seen through a variety of organisations and societies dedicated to these aspects of the area. Prompted by those concerns, the docklands unit of Dublin City Council is currently concluding a heritage audit, with the valued input of such diverse bodies as Dublin Port, Waterways Ireland, St. Andrew's Family Resource Centre, East Wall Historical Society and the Dublin Dock Workers Preservation Society, among others.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">When complete, this audit will inform best practice on the preservation of the rich heritage of the docklands and its presentation to a wider public. As we close one chapter in the history of the docklands, I am confident the next one will reflect a period of further development of an integrated and prosperous community as part of the wider city plan for future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> I thank Members for their contributions on the various Stages of this important legislation. I acknowledge, in particular, the valuable contribution of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on Committee Stage. This legislation will ensure the continuity of the economic development of a vital part of Dublin and the country. As responsibility for the management of the area moves into the hands of Dublin City Council, it is important that it engage deeply with the various organisations and community representatives, in particular. They reside in the area and have most interest in its beneficial development. It is vital that Dublin City Council continue this engagement in a positive fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I thank my officials for the preparation and work put into the Bill. In the next few years it will lead to the positive regeneration of an area of the capital city which will benefit society, the economy and, most importantly, the community living in and around it.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I welcome the opportunity to make some comments on the Bill. The exchanges in the debate on Committee Stage were good because the Minister of State was prepared to listen to and engage with us. I have a particular interest in this issue as I am from a docklands community and have relatives living in another docklands community nearby. I was brought up in this community; I still live in it and it is very important to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I will revisit some of the points I made on Committee Stage. The strategic development zone includes a particular area. We must, however, include the whole docklands area because it is not just about one part, the port. We must consider the connection with the communities living around it, both north and south of the River Liffey. I have read the Bill and wish the Minister of State well with it. It is good to see the dissolution of the DDDA, an organisation that was so tainted and which brought docklands communities into so many battles with it, but that is not to take from some of the good things that came from the organisation such as its support for some of the communities in terms of education and social activities. However, there is no doubt that it was a tainted organisation and that there were significant conflicts of interest. I hope the position will be more positive for the area in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> One of the issues I raised on Committee Stage concerned representation at the forum. It is important that the members of the forum include people who live in the area, including long-time residents and, in particular, those involved in community organisations such as youth groups which have been involved in the area during the years. There must be positive discrimination. I am not against new people coming in and being represented, but the voice of experience should be included as we have many such people living in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I am not a member of the committee that dealt with the Bill and must thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for letting me take her place for the debate. The committee engaged in a long consultation process and held public hearings which were attended by community groups, residents and organisations and then produced a report which was launched in October 2014. The launch was held in the AV room in Leinster House and there was significant positivity shown towards the report by those who had participated in the process. We can imagine their disappointment, therefore, when the 15 recommendations made did not appear in the Bill. There are slight variations in some of the recommendations made in the Bill, but the groups concerned left the Oireachtas that day thinking all of their views had been taken on board and would form part of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> One of the recommendations was related to housing. A figure of 20% for social housing was recommended. As the Minister of State is aware, Part V agreements have not delivered in the past, yet he is putting a lot of faith in the hope they will deliver now. Only a minuscule amount of social housing was built in the area in the past and we now have a very different community living in the financial services area. This community is separate from the others living around it. We need more social housing. The Minister of State said that if the cash-in-lieu provision had not gone ahead, there would have been 10,000 more social housing units. We must learn from this and ensure there will be strict monitoring of the provisions included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> We also discussed the issue of employment and brought forward the plan which had been proposed by the Grangegorman Development Association. I am a member of one of the Grangegorman bodies and at each meeting a report on the number of local jobs created by each of the companies is given. It would be good if this became an established principle for companies in the area. Nobody is asking a company to take on unqualified people, but there are qualified people living in the docklands area where there are higher unemployment rates than the national average. One of the youth projects of which I am aware does great work in supporting young boys to take manual handling courses and is building relationships with companies in the area. It would be good to build on this practice and include it as part of the oversight process. We should examine this practice to see if it is working and whether qualified local people are finding employment. This is particularly relevant for those in the 18 to 21 year old age group who cannot avail of community employment. If they are not involved in further education or training, they are very much at a loss. While this practice is accepted as a principle, we should consider how we can act on it and take on board the good practice applied in Grangegorman.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> We also discussed the issue of community gain. I acknowledge that one aspect of the DDDA that worked was its support for education initiatives. It supported people from difficult backgrounds and low income families to continue in education. I acknowledge the role of the National College of Ireland in promoting early childhood education. There are many examples of good practice in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Oversight is important in that it is vital to report back on progress made. We need a framework for this initiative to work. I suggest it cover housing, unemployment, community gain and community representation.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">The proposed amendment is aimed at removing what I believe to be a get-out clause on the part of the Department and the Child and Family Agency. Although I have stated that the Bill is welcome and that Sinn Féin will not be opposing it as it is a step in the right direction, it is not without its flaws. Why would one put resources into developing a plan that one does not have to implement? I am not saying that the plan should not be developed but that the resources to implement it must be there. The amendments I proposed which were ruled out of order were an attempt to tighten the legislation at, I believe, minimal cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> A man who has spent time in care expressed his disappointment to me regarding the Bill and said it was a tick-the-box exercise with all smiles for the cameras. They are his words, not mine. He said vulnerable voices are going unheard once again. I hope the Bill will be revisited at a later date to try to strengthen it and ensure an obligation of responsibility is met by the policy makers.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I do not propose to accept the amendment. As I mentioned on Second Stage, the Bill has a particular structure to ensure an obligation on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to prepare and draft an aftercare plan for that cohort of children and young people who meet the eligibility criteria as defined. Section 7 of the Bill, in subsection (1), states quite clearly that, "The Child and Family Agency shall, where any need is identified in an assessment of need carried out in respect of an eligible child in the care of the Agency, prepare an aftercare plan for that child." That, I believe, is unequivocal. A plan must be prepared for an eligible child. It must address the needs identified in an assessment carried out in accordance with section 6. There are no conditions or exclusions attached to the requirement to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child. The assessment of need will consider, but will not be limited to, domains such as education, financing and budgeting matters, training, employment, health and well being, and personal and social development. This is all set out in section 6. The agency will be required to record in writing the needs identified in the assessment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> As the Deputy is aware, the Child and Family Agency may not be the appropriate body to provide services to respond to all requirements identified in the assessment, yet it is this assessment of a broad range of needs that forms the basis for the aftercare plan. The need to have due regard to resources, therefore, does not present a barrier to the preparation and drafting of the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> I could continue at some length but the bottom line here is that we are clearly setting out a Bill that insists an aftercare plan be produced for children in care or those who have been in care. It allows them to then measure the plan against what is delivered. That is a huge step forward. Nowhere in our budgetary system is there allowance for exceeding one's ability to provide resources. We always have competition for resources between health, education, policing, etc. I believe the Bill to be a huge step forward. It addresses something that has seriously concerned me and, I know, many Members of this House, around the fact that in the past, many people who have left care have fallen into very serious difficulties, sometimes with tragic and fatal results.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the Bill during its passage through both Houses. In summary, the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2015 provides for an explicit requirement to prepare an aftercare plan in respect of a specified cohort of children and young people as they transition from State care. Following a needs assessment, the Child and Family Agency will prepare a plan in consultation with the young person. I believe this is critically important. It will identify their needs for aftercare supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The Bill puts aftercare planning on the same footing as other statutory obligations on the Child and Family Agency. The Bill attempts to take account of the need for a degree of nuance in planning for leaving care for young people at a time which is appropriate and sensitive to the young person's particular needs. Most importantly and as I mentioned previously, the child or young person must and will have a central role in the development of the aftercare plan. The involvement of young people in the planning of services for them is critical and is a positive development of recent years. It is something I wholeheartedly support.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Ireland has a poor record of caring for vulnerable children and we all know of the terrible tragedies involving some children after they left care. I hope our generation will be seen as the one that sought to address and redress this. The Bill is another step in the right direction. It builds on the significant initiatives and reforms that have taken place in recent years, including the development of a national leaving and aftercare policy in 2011, which have been developed with the goal of improving aftercare services for care leavers.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I pay tribute to this House for the manner in which the Bill has been welcomed and the constructive comments and contributions made here. A number of issues were raised, including the need for the Child and Family Agency to have regard to its resources when preparing aftercare plans. Deputies will know that this is nothing new. All State bodies are obliged to have regard to the resources made available to them in providing public services. However, I was pleased that significant extra resources have been allocated to the Child and Family Agency for 2016, which will strengthen its base funding level and give it greater capacity to respond to current risk and anticipated demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I also acknowledge Deputies' acceptance of the Bill at short notice, which has facilitated the progression of the Bill through the House as quickly as possible. I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate on the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2015, which I hope will deliver better outcomes for young people leaving the care of the State. These people are our future, they deserve the best and we must deliver.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">In the past week global leaders have attended the Paris summit on climate change. President Obama spoke about the need for this generation to act on climate change policy because if it does not it will be too late for future generations. It is a challenge and an opportunity for all of us to do what is right. It involves everyone in urban and rural areas taking up this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Wind energy guidelines were published in 2006 and there are many wind turbines around all parts of this country to help Ireland achieve its alternative energy targets. Last year 23% of Ireland’s energy requirement was produced by alternative energy sources. Four fifths of this came from onshore wind.</p>

New draft revisions to the noise setbacks and the shadow flicker in the 2006 wind energy guidelines were published two years ago this month. These required turbines to have a noise limit of 40 decibels and a setback of 500 m and a complete elimination of shadow flicker. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, started a further consultation process in spring 2014 and received up to 7,500 submissions that made many suggestions on how wind turbines could continue. This consultation delayed the publication of the new guidelines and got the Government through the European and local elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">However, there are guidelines in place and there is a good argument to make them statutory. There is a strong case for changing them to deal with the issues of noise and shadow flicker mentioned by Deputy Robert Troy. I consider the matter of having a setback distance unconnected with the issue of noise or shadow flicker to be more problematic. I have been honest about this because were there to be a setback distance similar to that advocated by some people, I repeat it would wipe out the use of onshore wind energy in this country as a renewable source. Incidentally, this is a technology Deputy Robert Troy's party when in government was happy and right to bring forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">Every day families are being made homeless. Thousands of children will sleep in unsuitable emergency accommodation tonight. Home repossessions, rising rents and a shortage of council housing are the causes of family homelessness. Councils not only have housing waiting lists, they now also have waiting lists for emergency accommodation. Families are being forced to sleep rough, overhold on their leases or move in with family and friends. A huge number of those who find themselves in this awful position are at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Let me give an example. Máire is a single mother with two children. She works full-time in a low-paid job in retail. Unable to afford child care, her mother minds the children while she is in work. She is not eligible for rent supplement and cannot find a landlord who will take the housing assistance payment. Máire's rent has increased by 20% in the past two years. The crunch came for her when her landlord served her with a €100 rent increase this year. She told him she simply did not have the money and he replied with a notice to quit.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> She looked frantically for alternative accommodation but could not find anything affordable. She presented to her local council homeless section but was turned away because all of the hostels and hotels were full. This case is not an isolated one; it happens day after day. A new survey from Co-operative Housing Ireland indicates that 32% of tenants across the State live in fear of losing their homes. In Dublin, 50% of tenants are fearful of becoming homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The only meaningful solution that will allay this fear is to link market rents to the consumer price index - in other words, to provide rent certainty. These families are being made homeless because of the Government's failure to introduce rent certainty. The Minister has urged others to demonstrate leadership. I urge him to demonstrate leadership and tell us when the Government will provide the rent certainty that families like Máire's desperately need.</p>

        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_325" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_431">It is not acceptable that in Ireland in 2015, we have families, including children, living in emergency accommodation. The case the Deputy raises, or any other such case, is simply unacceptable. The Deputy talks about the only meaningful solution. As she well knows, the only meaningful solution to this undoubted problem that exists - nobody denies that it exists - is that we actually resume as quickly as possible, as we are doing, a home building programme in the State, one that was abandoned disgracefully seven or eight years ago, where local authorities withdrew, and in fact were encouraged to withdraw, from the building of social housing. That will allow us to provide the homes that individuals and families need and in that way ensure we address the issue of homelessness. That is the only meaningful solution in my view. That is the leadership the Government is showing and needs to show in respect of this issue of the housing problem and the associated homeless factor that we have at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> We have increased funding, as the Deputy will be aware. We have allocated approximately €2.2 billion for social housing in the coming period. We have increased Exchequer support to address homelessness, in particular for emergency accommodation, by €17 million. Exchequer funding in that regard is now of the order of €70 million, an increase of 56% since 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> We have a cold weather action plan for the winter months in the Dublin area to assist people who are at risk of sleeping rough. Additional beds are being brought on line. We are addressing the emergency element of the problem and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is doing that effectively. That is what leadership is about and that is what we are doing and what we intend to continue to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Demonstrating leadership means having a range of policy approaches to address, first, the immediate emergency edge of the problem relating to homelessness, particularly in our cities, which is what we are doing. In the medium term, we need to get going as quickly as possible, as we are doing, with a social housing building programme. That is what we are addressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> On rent certainty, colleagues will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is bringing legislation through the Houses in respect of the rental sector. Additional certainty is being afforded by that legislation so that we can do as much as we can with the legislative measures we put in place to ensure that people who are in rental accommodation are not in fear of rent increases on a regular basis and that can only happen over the new period of two years.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">It is not acceptable for the Minister to say to families, such as Máire's, that their predicament is not acceptable when the Government has a hand in creating their misery. That is the truth. The coalition has been in government for almost five years and its record on social housing build is pathetic. I am shocked that the Minister and his colleagues repeatedly give out that message as though they had revolutionised social housing provision - far from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> What it has allowed is a situation where families, including children, sleep in bed and breakfasts, hostels and hotels, if they are lucky. What it has allowed is a situation where children try to make it to school every day for weeks on end from those hotels, if they are lucky. What it has allowed is a situation where people sleep on sofas or in their mothers' box rooms for months or years. What it has allowed is fear in a whole generation not alone that they will not own their own home but that they will be priced out of the rented accommodation on which they rely, the place they call home.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I ask the Minister to clarify this because I am curious to know. Last night the Government Members voted down Sinn Féin legislation on the issue of rent certainty and the prevention of homelessness. Revealingly enough, most of the Minister's colleagues did not consider it worth their while to show up for the debate. How does the Minister answer Máire who needs rent certainty and all those tenants - the figures do not lie - 50% of whom are in Dublin and more than 30% are across the State who currently fear they will be priced out of their homes? When will they get rent certainty or has the Government given up the ghost on that? This is on its watch and it is its responsibility. The Minister should not talk to others about leadership when he so clearly fails in that regard.</p>

It includes a one-stop-shop for borrowers providing free financial and legal expertise and representation.</p>

It is a genuine piece of legislation that will address the position faced by too many people, as a consequence of the economic crash we had to deal with in this country in recent years. I admit that I have not seen the proposals that are contained in the Deputy's document. I am sorry about that but I will read them, as I am sure he will read the proposals of other parties in the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_559">I welcome the fact the Cabinet has agreed to reduce the bankruptcy period. I tabled such a proposal in 2012 and the Government voted against it. I tabled it subsequent to that also and the Government again voted against it. I recognise and welcome the fact the Government has changed its position and is now reducing the period to one year. However, when we talk about recognising Government achievements, when it comes to the mortgage crisis, the Government's achievement is abject failure. It gives me no pleasure to say that to the Minister. Ireland's level of mortgage arrears is several times higher than other European countries which faced similar economic and housing challenges. Why? The reason is the Government took a hands-off approach and said the banks would pretty much have to solve this themselves on a case-by-case basis. Every Member of this House is helping constituents with mortgage arrears.</p>

          <p eId="para_561">Every Member of this House knows that the first question one asks a borrower when they come in is whether they have had financial advice. Most of them say they cannot afford financial advice. Then we ask whether they have had legal advice and if they can afford legal representation. They say they cannot afford legal representation and that if they could, they would not be in mortgage arrears. Then we ask them who is their lender, because the Minister and everyone of us knows the answer to that question will largely determine whether the family is going to recover or be buried by a vindictive lender. The Minister and I know that from our time together on the finance committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> The Social Democrats has a set of policy proposals. A one-stop-shop for borrowers would provide financial and legal advice for free and it could be set up now. MABS is in place. Other social sector organisations are in place. We do not need to wait for legislation. We do not need to wait for a new Government next year to find its feet and figure out what it wants to do and negotiate a programme for Government. This could be done now.</p>

          <p eId="para_565"> Before the next election the Government could introduce a one-stop-shop, mandate a set of solutions and scale up the mortgage to rent scheme. All of those things are possible.

            <p eId="para_764">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue. </p>
            <p eId="para_765"> I was contacted by one school in County Galway which offers a post-leaving certificate, PLC, course in child care. Part of the course involves students gaining work experience which requires Garda vetting. Two students who started the course in September have still not received their vetting clearance and it is now early December. This has a knock-on effect. Part of the course involves gaining work experience and they cannot do this without vetting clearance. Even when they have completed the course, they will have to be Garda vetted again if they take up employment in a child care setting. Waiting times for applications to be Garda vetted are up to 14 weeks, which is proving extremely frustrating not only for the school but also for these participants in the PLC course mentioned. These are students who want to further their education and get into a specific area. It is one in which an arm of the State is actually holding them back.</p>
            <p eId="para_766"> This problem has been ongoing for many years. It does not just cover schools but also the voluntary sector and sports groups. I worked with Foróige, a national youth organisation, for four years in which we had to vet volunteers. Delays in vetting are completely unacceptable. When this issue was raised before, one answer was that there were not enough staff in the Garda vetting section and more staff were provided for it as a result. We need to move past this. In certain parts of Europe a person can walk into the local police station, provide the equivalent of a PPS number and a vetting letter will be sent there and then. Why is our system so archaic that it takes many application forms and stymies the opportunity for people to move on in what they want to do? If one is working in the voluntary sector with one organisation, one will have received Garda clearance. If one moves to another organisation, one must apply again. That is also unacceptable. We need to do a lot of work to reduce the delays in being Garda vetted from 12 weeks to an average of two, as well as to completely change the processing system to make it easier for people to be vetted.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_767">I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter as it provides me with an opportunity to inform the House that the current average processing time for Garda vetting applications is, in fact, four weeks from date of receipt. This is not considered to be an unacceptable delay in processing times for Garda vetting applications. Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete. Taking into account the need to protect children and vulnerable adults, while providing an effective and efficient service, this period is not unreasonable.</p>
            <p eId="para_768"> The Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, provides for employment vetting for organisations, registered with the Garda for this purpose, which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity in positions where they have substantial, unsupervised access to children and-or vulnerable adults. Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order, based on the date of receipt in the GCVU. All organisations registered for the purpose of Garda vetting are aware of the processing timeframes and have been advised to factor them into their recruitment and selection processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_769"> Approximately 18,000 organisations are in receipt of vetting services from the GCVU, covering a wide range of health, educational, sports and recreation sectors. The GCVU provides ongoing support and advice for these organisations in managing their vetting requirements. To put some perspective on the matter, in 2014 the GCVU processed over 318,000 applications, while up to 293,292 have been processed to date in 2015. The majority of these applications were dealt with in the average four week processing time referred to. Processing times can fluctuate, depending on seasonal demands and volumes of applications received. On occasion, further inquiries have to be conducted in respect of some applications. In such instances, processing times may be longer than the general average. Given the primary objective of the vetting process, the Deputy will agree that the necessity for a thorough inquiry is understandable. I will undertake, however, to pass on the specific concerns he has raised to the Minister for her attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I think the Minister of State for his response. The problem is that it is claimed the average waiting time for vetting clearance is four weeks. I can, however, give the Minister of State an example of two students who applied at the end of September but who have still not received clearance and it is early December. I might not be a mathematician, but that is more than four weeks. It is actually eight. These two students have been held back from gaining work experience and further work. I am disappointed that the reply started with a reference to the four-week average waiting time and then moved to the fluctuations due to seasonal issues excuse. That is covering it both ways. The Department should consider that pressure will be exerted on the system at the start of September when PLC courses start.</p>
            <p eId="para_771"> There was nothing in the reply from the Department about changing the vetting system. I was a youth worker for four years and very much understand the need for adequate Garda vetting, particularly when one has volunteers working with young children. However, that is not a good enough reason for there being a long delay. I am looking for a change in the process. Nobody is trying to short-circuit the Garda vetting process because we all know how important it is. However, the reply does not hold much water for the two students who have been waiting eight weeks for clearance. I will supply the details of the two individuals concerned to the Minister of State and the Department to see if we can speed up this element of the Garda vetting process.</p>

            <p eId="para_772">The Minister for Justice and Equality is resolute in her view that the protection of children and vulnerable adults must remain a priority. She is also aware, however, of the necessity to provide a modern and efficient service. During the Government’s lifetime, staffing levels at the GCVU have increased by almost 100% and the average vetting application processing time has dropped by almost ten weeks in most cases. This has been achieved by the redeployment of staff from other Departments, resulting in a more efficient and effective use of existing resources and a substantially improved service to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_773"> I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised a specific case.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">I have undertaken to bring this particular case to the Minister as an example of a case which is taking substantially longer than it possibly should. There will always be some cases that for one reason or other take longer to consider. Each case must receive the attention it requires. The processing time, when considered in the context of the tasks involved, is found to be reasonable and allows An Garda Síochána to take measures to seek to ensure that the most vulnerable in society remain protected. </p>
            <p eId="para_775"> As already stated, I will undertake to pass on the Deputy's concerns to the Minister who will respond directly.</p>

            <p eId="para_779">I am disappointed the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not here. I understand the Minister is in Africa but I am surprised the Minister of State is not here. We were told that one of the reforms of the Dáil which would take place would be that Ministers or Ministers of State, where relevant, would be present in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_780"> A year ago, there was huge concern in the beef industry about the price differential being achieved between British and Irish cattle on the British market. We had farmers outside the factory gates. Eventually, in response to this, the Minister set up the beef forum. A year on, to use an appropriate metaphor considering the Minister is in Africa, the beef forum has turned out to be a toothless tiger. It has had no significant effect on the massive problems that beset the beef trade. </p>
            <p eId="para_781"> Significant allegations were made by a significant farming organisation during the week. It believes there is a conscious policy by one of the major meat groups that operates not only in this country but also in Britain to try to block the sale of young cattle for finishing in Britain by saying they could not be marketed in Britain as British and would, therefore, have to be significantly discounted. When we look at the price comparisons between this year and last year, it is significant that the price of beef has increased by approximately 70 cent per kilo while the equivalent Irish price has only increased by approximately 10 cent to 15 cent. Last autumn, the price differential was 70 cent. This year it is 110 cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_782"> The second part to this matter is the total failure of the Department to deal with the price issue relating to vegetables. I thought the Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture, a colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, would be here today. I have been calling on him to stop standing back and allowing the supermarkets force the horticulture industry into a precarious situation. The supermarkets are, effectively, dumping food onto the market by selling it at absolutely ridiculous prices, prices at which no farmer can produce the produce. This happened in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_783"> There was some co-operation by the Minister's party and the Government last year to try to persuade the various parties that it should not happen again. Will the Minister of State make a public statement today that the Government believes it is unacceptable for any supermarket chain to engage in a similar practice again this year? Will the Government state that the horticulture industry is in important one not only to those involved in it but to Irish people in general because they want an Irish horticulture industry? Will the Government state that it believes it would be wrong of the supermarkets to try to destroy the industry through totally uneconomic pricing?</p>
            <p eId="para_784"> Will the Minister of State address these issues? I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to speak on them today.</p>

          <speech by="#PaudieCoffey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_564">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_785">I apologise on behalf of both Ministers who, unfortunately, are unavailable as they are away on State business. As a former Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív will understand there are times when they cannot be here personally. However, I am here to take the Topical Issue and am happy to do so on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_786"> As Deputy Ó Cuív is well aware, beef prices are matters to be determined between the purchasers and sellers of cattle. Prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics and by a range of different factors, such as consumer preferences, distance to market, consumer confidence, retail promotions, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, like any other agriculture Minister in the EU, can have no role in influencing commodity prices paid to farmers. I note, however, that 2015 has been a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date up 8% on last year. Irish beef prices are also 105% of the EU15 average price for 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_787"> The divergence in price between Ireland and Britain is a result of the exceptionally strong sterling exchange rates that have been in place for most of the year. It should be noted that, in sterling terms, prices paid to British farmers so far this year are broadly the same as previous years. In other words, British beef farmers are not gaining any more for their output than last year. However, as already noted, Irish farmers are receiving prices on average 8% higher than last year and, therefore, the price difference has narrowed and not widened, if one removes the influence of currency fluctuations.</p>
            <p eId="para_788"> It must always be remembered that comparisons between Irish and British beef prices have to take into account that we are both primarily selling into the British market where there is a consumer preference for their own British product. This preference for local product is true of almost every beef market in the world. This also means that there is pressure from the British beef sector on retailers to prioritise its produce over imports from abroad, including our Irish beef. This is a significant competitiveness challenge for Irish beef which cannot be overlooked when comparing prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> Notwithstanding these challenges, the most up-to-date figures from the CSO show that this year, we have exported more than €100 million more beef to Great Britain compared to the same period last year. This is a prime example of the high esteem that Irish beef is held in and I would be confident that in the coming weeks, considering the seasonal trend, we will see sustained trade of beef to Britain.</p>
            <p eId="para_790"> This has also been a good year for the mart trade as prices for calves are up 20% in the year compared to 2014. Beef breed calves are up 15% alone on 2014 prices and, again, this is a result of Northern Irish buyers using the strong exchange rate to purchase stock from the Republic.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has also made provision for a package of support measures for the beef sector in 2015 worth more than €70 million. This includes the beef data and genomics programme which forms part of Ireland's draft rural development programme. The proposed programme will have a budget of €300 million over a period of six years and is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the herd through the application of genomic technology. It will also position Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our place as one of the most important export-focused beef producing nations in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_792"> As Ireland exports 90% of the beef that it produces, it is vital that we have many diverse markets to sell our product into in order to ensure primary producers here receive the best prices available.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">The Department engages on an ongoing basis with many third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish embassy staff, the meat industry and the European Commission on various market access issues. In fact, the Minister is not present today because he is in Ghana at a promotion event for Irish beef as we speak.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I ask the Minister of State to also explain the absence of the Ministers of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is extraordinary that they would plan their diaries so that they would all be away when the Dáil is sitting.</p>
            <p eId="para_795"> I do not even know where to start in response to the reply given by the Minister of State because not taking currency fluctuations into account is ridiculous. We know when a currency loses value, as the euro has done, that should be to the advantage of exporters. Therefore, comparing both prices in either euro or sterling shows exactly what I have said, namely, that the differential has widened from 70 cent last year to 110 cent this year. There is a constant mantra from this Government, which I know is right-wing and <i>laissez-faire</i>, that we cannot interfere. In Britain, there is a grocery code adjudicator in place. Will the Minister of State outline to the House the regulations that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, intends to introduce in that regard? </p>
            <p eId="para_796"> It is very interesting to note that the EU Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, a former Fine Gael Deputy who served in the Department to which Deputy Coffey is now attached, does not think the EU should stand back and allow a small number of supermarkets to rule the roost. He is keen on European intervention and regulation, if necessary, to bring the supermarkets to heel. This brings me to my next point. I am flabbergasted the Minister of State made no mention of the horticulture industry in his reply. I call on the Government to urge the supermarkets not to repeat what happened in 2013 and to ensure that both green grocers and those in the horticulture industry are not decimated by the reckless practices and overweening dominance of the supermarket chains. If the Minister of State is worried about the lawfulness of this, he should refer to Article 45 of the Constitution which requires the Government to ensure that big business does not abuse dominance in the market to the detriment of the common good.</p>

            <p eId="para_816">With all due respect, no allegation was made. I have reassured the Deputy that horticulture is being given the highest priority by this Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As I have just said, the Minister would be more than happy to respond in more detail to the Deputy with regard to the concerns he raises relating to horticulture. I am making no allegations but am simply reassuring the Deputy that horticulture is an issue of high priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> I am addressing the beef related issues raised in the Deputy's Topical Issue which is before me. Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across the EU. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia's differentiation strategy, which focuses on the main attributes of Irish beef, namely, environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_818"> Since taking office, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has led trade missions to a wide variety of destinations including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan, the Gulf States and west Africa, where he is today, to promote Irish food and beverages, including meat exports. These initiatives have led to several notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran, the US, Canada and Oman. The ban in China on boneless beef from Ireland has been lifted for animals under 30 months, thus making Ireland the first and only EU member state to reach this stage. Further work is required before trade will commence and the Department is currently engaging with the Chinese authorities on the technical details.</p>
            <p eId="para_819"> The beef market in the US was opened in January 2015 and as of the start of November 2015, an estimated 1,300 tonnes valued at €9 million has already been exported. This is a strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only began in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September. Ireland has now become the second largest supplier of beef to the Philippines and supplied around 20% of its beef imports during the first quarter of 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_820"> The Minister has invited stakeholders to the next round table which will take place on 16 December. The Minister established the round table last year for the purpose of bringing all sectoral stakeholders together and facilitating open discussion between industry, farming organisations and others on the strategic path forward for the beef sector. There have been a number of notable successes from the round table already and the next meeting will see further progress including on establishing producer organisations in the beef sector for the first time. </p>

            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_821">I am disappointed the Minister for Health is not in the House to take this Topical Issue. I know he is not abroad because he was in the House earlier today. While I welcome my colleague from Waterford, Deputy Coffey, this is not his area of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_822"> On 25 September 2014, the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, took to the streets outside this House to protest over cutbacks that have closed rural GP practices and forced newly qualified GPs to go abroad to work. In the intervening period, nothing has changed. In fact, the situation is much worse. Rural GPs, who have already experienced a 40% cut to their income as a result of cuts to fees and allowances introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, are still expected to operate without the guaranteed provision of a rural practice allowance and this is patently unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_823"> The Minister for Health was urged in 2014 to redirect just 2% of the health budget to general practitioner services every year for the next three years to try to reintroduce parity of esteem for general practitioners. The NAGP has confirmed that up to 32 rural GP posts remain unfilled. Government policies are posing a serious threat to the health of people in rural areas and its unwillingness to fund the rural practice allowance has prevented doctors who would like to practice in rural areas from doing so. It was understood for decades by various Governments and the Department of Health that rural GPs need modest support structures in order to be able to function properly and remain viable and that is still true today.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">In the case of Bansha, the incumbent, Dr. Madigan, is a wonderful doctor who has given sterling service, with her staff, the district nurses and health service staff. She has looked after the community very well. She is ill and has announced her intention to retire. I wish her well. However, we will not get a rural GP because people have been blindfolded and have their hands tied behind their backs.</p>
            <p eId="para_825"> The rural practice allowance is vital. There is no point in the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, coming to Bansha to reassure a public meeting that the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has promised to restore the general practice allowance in Bansha when there are 31 other posts to be filled, including in Clogheen in my own back yard, where a wonderful doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, who has been there 18 months cannot receive the allowance and is struggling to remain in place. When I had a parliamentary question answered by the Minister yesterday, he said it was a matter for the HSE. Someone is codding someone. Either the Minister is telling us fibs or the HSE is. The fact remains that Bansha general practice is in a serious position. Its GP is entitled to retire, but we are demanding that the post be readvertised and that the general practice allowance be included because it is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_826"> I am told that there is a further complicating factor, although I do not have 100% proof of this, namely, that the HSE intends to charge rent for use of the health centre. This will make it completely untenable for any GP to use it. As a result, GPs are not applying for these posts. The GP in Gortnahoe wants to retire and a total of 32 doctors throughout the country are in this position, including in the Taoiseach's constituency of Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> It is time the Government woke up to this problem. Pumping money into the so-called centres in Tipperary town and other areas where there are large practices is fine, but it is not fair to have people affected by the closure of rural practices, in particular, given that rural transport services are also being taken away. The regular transport service is not enough and people will be unable to get to Tipperary town, Cahir or Cashel. In addition, they currently have the comfort of knowing their GP and the staff in his or her practice, as well as the nurses, all of whom know the needs of their patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> For many families the GP is the first line of defence, as the Minister of State knows. Whether it is a parent worried about a son or a daughter or a child worried about an elderly parent, the GP is the first person to be asked whether the patient is presenting with symptoms of, for example, Alzheimer's disease. The GP is the first line of defence and, in many cases, the only line of defence people living in rural Ireland have. We lost the post office in Bansha and have lost many other things throughout rural Ireland. We cannot and will not lose the general practice, too. </p>
            <p eId="para_829"> The Minister for Health should be here to answer this question. There is no point in there being a nod and a wink. The rural practice allowance must be restored in Bansha.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_830">I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Health. I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on GP services. I acknowledge the contribution GPs and their staff have made both in urban and rural areas to the health and welfare of citizens. I assure the Deputy that the Government is strongly committed to the future of rural Ireland. Like him, I come from a rural constituency. We recognise the contribution rural communities have made to overall national economic development, as well as to the development of their local areas. Our vision is of vibrant, inclusive, economically thriving rural areas. The people living in these communities should experience a quality of life at least as high, if not better in several respects, as that experienced in urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> The Government is committed to ensuring patients throughout the country will continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas, and that general practice will be sustainable in such areas into the future. The HSE, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation are engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector GP contracts. Among the issues encompassed by the review process is support for general practice, especially in remote rural areas. I do not propose to comment on the detail of these ongoing negotiations. Under the current GMS contract, GPs who practise in remote rural areas of low population qualify for special rural practice concessions, including an annual allowance of just over €16,200 and more favourable subsidies towards the employment of staff, including practice nurses and secretarial support. More advantageous supports towards locum costs for leave are also payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> The HSE has recently produced revised rural practice allowance guidelines for remote rural areas. The purpose of the new guidance is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in decision-making regarding relevant discretionary provisions of the GMS contract as they apply to rural GP practices. The guidance also provides for greater flexibility in considering applications from GPs than that provided for in the original governing circular, as well as providing additional options to support GPs. From time to time HSE local offices also offer other incentives to attract GPs into rural areas such as access to HSE facilities and the offer of additional contracts such as providing medical officer services for nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> I am aware that some isolated rural areas and deprived urban areas, very often with limited private practice opportunities, may find it difficult to attract GPs to fill vacant posts. However, I have been assured by the HSE that where a GMS GP vacancy arises, the executive takes the necessary steps to ensure continuity of service to GMS patients is maintained.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-12-03T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_834">I thank the Minister of State, but this is more waffle from the HSE. The plain fact is that too many cuts have taken place. I salute a young man in Bansha, Mr. Andrew O'Halloran, and his team for raising this issue, organising a public meeting and bringing their concerns, through me, to the floor of Dáil Éireann. The HSE states it will advertise posts and do everything it can to ensure continuity of service. It is like the farmer going to the creamery without the bulk tank because he or she forgets to bring it. An appealing contract is what is needed. That is what we had for more than 40 years with the rural practice allowance, but it has been taken away with one swipe. To add insult to injury, rent is now being sought for use of the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_835"> We are not going to get any qualified GP to come to a rural area in these circumstances. We are, therefore, shutting the door on rural Ireland. The Minister of State is a rural Deputy from my neighbouring constituency and should know this because it is plain and simple. Bansha was home to the late, great Canon Hayes who founded Muintir na Tíre. He always said it was better to light a candle than to curse the dark, but the Government is quenching the candle. It is extinguishing life in rural Ireland. It is taking sustenance from rural families, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable who want to meet their GP in their own area. People can walk or get a lift or a taxi to their local village. They do not want to be forced to travel ten or 12 miles to a doctor's surgery that is already full. A GP from Tipperary town said last week that he could not take any more patients because his practice was already overflowing.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> It is a sad day when we allow the HSE to dictate to the Government and close down the rural practice in Bansha by stealth. It is making it uninviting or unappealing for any GP to work there because there is too much red tape and so little support. Shame on the Minister for allowing this to happen and shame on the Government for putting up the gates and quenching the lights in rural Ireland, especially in Bansha, which the late Canon Hayes ensured would be one of the first places to benefit from rural electrification in the 1950s. It is an insult to the people living there and the Government has done the same in many areas. Its view is to hell with the people. Cromwell said, "To hell or to Connacht." The Government is almost as bad. It is not good enough. I ask it to stand up to the HSE and ensure the rural practice allowance is reinstated. There are 32 communities which are affected, including Bansha.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">In fact, we have committed substantial resources and funding to ensure they will remain open and be supported as much as possible. The Deputy is concerned about the practice in Bansha, on which I will comment. However, there is a reason there is a vacancy there and it is not Government-created. It is, unfortunately, that its GP is on sick leave. That is the genuine reason there is a vacancy and the HSE informs us that it will be advertised. It will become vacant from 17 January 2016, according to the information I have received. The post is being covered by a locum, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, which means that all patients have access to GP services in Bansha.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">It is important that is noted here because if one were to listen to the Deputy, one would swear the Government had closed the GP practice and disregarded the needs of the patients. That is not correct.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">With due respect, that is not correct. A locum is covering the practice and all patients have access to GP services. HSE South-East has advertised the post, but, unfortunately, there have been no applicants to date. However, the filling of the Bansha post is under consideration by the HSE. This consideration includes whether supports may be necessary in order to attract a suitable applicant to take on the post. For the information of the Deputy, there are no other GP vacancies in either south or north Tipperary and the next retirement in north Tipperary is not due until 2017. Therefore, the situation is not as bad as the Deputy has outlined. He is correct to raise concerns, but the HSE is responding and the service is being retained for the patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> On 1 November, there were just 20 GMS lists, out of a national total of over 2,400, without a permanent GP in place. That is far from the accusation made by the Deputy in regard to the Government closing GP practices. That accusation is simply not true. Eight of the 20 vacancies are in rural areas with less than 1,500 people. However, the full range of GP services to patients continues to be provided for the patients concerned, through either a locum GP or a neighbouring GP. This will continue.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for including this issue for debate. Like most Members, I welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, in the recent budget in regard to child care. Any improvements in the child care sector must be welcomed. As Members are aware, there are shortcomings in the sector, principally due to the fact that child care is so expensive in this jurisdiction. Child care costs here are probably the most expensive in Europe. In some European countries child care is provided for as little as €150 a month and in France subsidised child care is provided. In Ireland, particularly in large urban centres, child care costs can be as high as €1,000 a month per child. Costs are lower in rural areas, but in general the cost is prohibitive. Repeatedly, people say the cost of child care is the equivalent of having an additional mortgage. This is true for many families.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> While we welcome the improvements announced in the budget, the additional places, etc. many of us have pointed out some of the shortcomings in regard to the initiatives. My concern is about the findings of the survey conducted by Early Childhood Ireland which was published yesterday. Some issues raised in the survey are of concern. The survey highlighted that 62% of respondents said they did not plan to expand their child care service as a result of the budget proposals, while 27% said they were not sure whether they would. The big issue in terms of the challenge to expand to meet the needs of the proposed scheme is capitation. Child care providers say capitation is too low. Another issue is the lack of space and funding to expand their facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_848"> The survey also highlighted that in response to the question of whether the changes in the budget were good for child care providers, 23% said "No", while 49% said they were not sure yet. These are serious issues if we are to improve child care services. The Minister acknowledged when the budget was announced that we are on a new journey in terms of bringing about improvements in child care. If the results of the Early Childhood Ireland survey are true, we face serious issues in regard to improving child care in the future, which is why I have raised this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I am pleased to outline the Government's position on recent measures introduced in budget 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> Budget 2016 implemented a key recommendation of both the expert advisory group on the early years strategy and of the interdepartmental group on future investment in child care, by providing for an entitlement to free preschool for all children, from age three until they start school, and by funding a new model of support to ensure children with disabilities can participate in free preschool alongside their peers. The value of these measures is underpinned by the findings of extensive consultation during the course of the interdepartmental group's work. These were key priorities for parents, preschool providers and experts on the early years.</p>
            <p eId="para_851"> The expansion of the free preschool programme, which will take effect from September 2016, means that the number of children benefitting from the free preschool provision is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given year. The decision to implement this new entitlement from September 2016 was made to allow the early years sector time to build capacity and adjust to the new parameters of the programme. Accommodating change can be challenging, but as demand is not expected to peak until January and April 2017, this should provide the necessary time to make any infrastructural and-or service changes, and to put in place additional staff to meet the increased demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_852"> A number of factors indicate that the additional required capacity in the preschool sector will be realised. The annual survey of early years' services, conducted in December 2014, estimated that there were more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country and that almost 13,000 of these vacancies were in sessional services. It is also the case that a significant number of services apply to be providers of the free preschool programme every year. This increased demand for and additional investment in free preschool is likely to encourage a greater number of applicants.</p>

            <p eId="para_853">I thank the Minister of State for that reply. I have mentioned the high cost of child care in Ireland. It is worth mentioning that for many low income families, child care costs are so high that parents have little choice but to leave the workforce. Those of us with constituency clinics are aware of many examples of people who are working in low paid jobs who cannot afford to continue to work because of the high costs of child care. We must be conscious of this and must try to follow the European model of investing in child care and allowing families avail of child care facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> Another issue which was a criticism I raised when the budget for child care services was announced is that a significant omission was a provision to deal with how overworked and badly paid those who worked in the child care sector were.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">It causes all sorts of problems in terms of qualifications, etc. It tends to be a sector in which the workforce is, in many cases, in transit. The level of wages is so low. It is hard work and badly paid. That was one of my criticisms at the time it was announced during the budget. I hope the Minister will address the matter in the very near future, as other jurisdictions have, particularly in respect of qualifications of those working in the child care sector. There should be some kind of scheme that will give them a living wage in order that they will not be on the sort of wages most of them receive.</p>

            <p eId="para_856">I note the Deputy's genuine concerns about staffing, recruitment and training and retention of staff in the sector. He makes a very important and valuable point which I will pass on to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_857"> The restoration of capitation rates to pre-2012 levels from September 2016 and the introduction of additional capitation payments under the new model of support to ensure children with disabilities can participate in free preschool facilities should also encourage a greater number of new applicants and encourage existing preschool providers to expand. It is clear that more capacity will be required and January and April enrolments may pose a challenge. However, officials in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are committed to assisting with these challenges. They are undertaking a mapping exercise to identify where the additional capacity will be required. They are working closely with all of the city and county child care committees and voluntary child care organisations on a range of measures which will assist preschool providers to meet the increased demand for free preschool provision. That engagement is very important and timely. Further information on these measures will also be made available very shortly.</p>
