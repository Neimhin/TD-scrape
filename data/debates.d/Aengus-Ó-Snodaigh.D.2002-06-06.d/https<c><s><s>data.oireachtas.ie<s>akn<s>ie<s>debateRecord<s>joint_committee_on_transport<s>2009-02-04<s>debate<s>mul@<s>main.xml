          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_13">The first item on our agenda is a discussion with representatives of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that members of the committee have absolute privilege, but this same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee.  Members are reminded of the parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I welcome Mr. Tim Hayes, Mr. Martin Nolan and Mr. Vincent Sheehan of Bus Éireann and Mr. Joe Meagher, Mr. Paddy Doherty and Mr. Mick Matthews of Dublin Bus.  I will invite Bus Éireann to present its submission first.  The committee has received the submissions in advance.  While we appreciate all the information contained in them, we would prefer the delegation to deal with the particular issue of the routes which are being curtailed or discontinued as a result of the cutbacks.  Much of what is contained in the submission will not need to be discussed in great detail as we can read it later.  I invite the delegation to dwell on the impact on the customer and consumer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I thank the committee for inviting me to speak on the Deloitte report and the situation facing the company.  Over the years we have developed our integrated network very substantially.  However, due to the economic downturn our customer numbers have declined.  Deloitte in its report pointed out that we are an efficient company.  We provide a good network of services in an effective manner.  The report acknowledges that outside of our cost saving and cost control programmes, we will need to trim our network in line with demand to bring us back to a more financially stable position.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">We have developed our network and increased frequencies on city services by 50% since 2000 when the national development plan was introduced.  We have three times more capacity on the commuter routes in and out of Dublin and we have increased passenger numbers by 15%.  We have been generally profitable and we have been using some of the funds generated to maintain social services.  An ongoing cost control programme is in place which last year saved €6 million which is approximately 4% of the cost base needed to maintain services.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Fewer people are employed in the network.  Retail sales are down by 8% and retail sales are important to the company because of the direct correlation between retail sales and people travelling on buses.  If retail sales are down then fewer people are travelling.  The number of visitors to Ireland has declined by 3% and more so in the west and there are also fewer non-nationals in the country.  Overall there has been a decline in the numbers of workers, shoppers, tourists and discretionary travellers using our services.  The decline in our numbers has been approximately 5% last year and the projected decline for this year is 5% to 6%.  Over two years the demand will be down by 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The company made a profit of €7 million in 2007.  Our forecasted operating loss for last year is €9 million.  If the issues are not addressed in the future, the loss this year could be as much as €30 million.  The main reasons for this decline includes a drop of €8 million in revenue, the loss of the fuel rebate accounts for €10 million, pension costs account for €4 million and the national wage agreement accounts for €5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The information from the Deloitte report is available to the committee.  The report finds that Bus Éireann is efficient and that it provides a comprehensive and integrated network.  It refers to subvention levels being 12% and that the company is efficient in all the areas covered by the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Deloitte examined the options for the company given the downturn in the economy.  The slide shows that Deloitte regards the company as efficient with limited scope for savings and that further savings will largely have to come through service rationalisation.  The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_20">It will not be possible to make major cost savings on the Bus Éireann network without reducing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Cost reduction programmes are in place and further measures are being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Deloitte make a range of recommendations which are already under way.  I refer to the use of double-deck coaches.  Real-time information will be in place by mid-2009 which will provide further marketing benefits.  We are working to plan for the introduction of integrated ticketing and vending machines.  We are planning an increase in information technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The Chairman has asked me to talk about services.  There is a statutory responsibility on the company, the board and the management and staff, to be in a strong financial position and we have to address the current trends.  This is driven by the economic situation and Deloitte has confirmed our approach to be correct.  Before we looked at any service cutbacks, we considered all other options.  For example, an ongoing cost efficiency programme has been in place for a number of years.  Savings last year amounted to twice what would normally be saved.  We have saved €6 million on our cost base.  We have also put together an additional substantial cost reduction programme which we will discuss with the trade unions next week.  We are endeavouring to maximise our revenue through marketing and sales promotions.  However, we need to adjust our network while minimising the impact on integrated networks.  This point was made in the Deloitte report.  It emphasised the importance of the integrated network and highlighted the importance of, for example, people travelling from Crusheen to wherever or from Westport to Dungarvan.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The review of routes will include a reduction in frequency and the focus will be on the poorly supported departures on routes.  Peak-time services will be maintained in line with demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Regarding the cost effectiveness plan, the company is engaging with the trade unions and providing them with an overview.  However, we have not discussed the detail of the routes as we hope to meet the trade unions next week on this matter.  This is a very sensitive issue and we must all be conscious that when routes are mentioned, the staff involved need to be the first to be informed and this is particularly the case in a rural area because every one knows who is affected.  We plan to meet the trade unions next week and go through the details with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Our programme will involve a pay freeze.  We are endeavouring to reduce our fleet by 150 buses.  This will result in a reduction of approximately 10% which is 320 staff across all grades.  It is regrettable and we will try to accomplish this in the most sensitive manner possible.  It is associated with the decline in the economy and it is necessary for the company to maintain services to the majority of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">On the question of the cutbacks on routes, in many cases these will be reductions in frequency in line with any decline in demand.  Some rural areas have very little support for buses as the numbers are very small and it is very difficult to justify some of these routes.  We will discuss this issue in greater detail with our staff.  We have not given this detail to our staff as yet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_28">The committee respects the fact that Bus Éireann must discuss specific routes with the trade unions.  While I would like to hear more details I am prepared to accept that point.  However, we need to get some idea of the kinds of routes.  Are we to take it in the Bus Éireann case that several of the rural routes will be affected — I accept the point made that if they are not being used it is difficult to justify their existence — or will it be intercity routes?  I would like some general breakdown of the kinds of routes.  I also seek examples of rural routes that are not being utilised.  Without specifying the route it might be possible to give us an example of the kinds of passenger numbers, revenue etc.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_29">We are happy to accept the invitation to attend.  A number of the points Mr. Hayes are common to Dublin Bus.  The first slide in my presentation gives a summary of passenger numbers.  In the first half of the decade we had growth and we were then affected by the Luas and rail developments.  Luas is now carrying close to 30 million people in corridors we serve.  We returned to growth in 2007 and had planned for further growth in 2008 with the economy continuing to grow.  However, the global recession and the recession here hit very suddenly and affected our business.  Instead of a projected 152 million the actual figure was 143.5 million, which was a big drop on our projections and also a drop on the previous year and a reversal of the trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The second slide contains a summary of recent developments and shows that a number of positive things have been happening.  I may return to those later.  I highlight the strong development of the bus-Luas tickets.  There is considerable co-ordination between the two services at this stage.  We will be introducing real-time passenger information on the web and on mobile phones from next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I now move to the effect of the recession.  Putting it in very simple terms the demand for travel has reduced for all public transport operators.  Bus, train and tram have all been affected.  Fewer people are travelling to work, shop and socialise.  We have a number of examples.  Bus loadings to one particular industrial estate have reduced by 50% and others have reduced by somewhat less than that.  In certain areas there might have been six busloads leaving between 6.30 a.m. and 7.15 a.m. a year ago and now there are between two and 2.5 busloads.  We need to deal with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Carryings on weekends in January reduced by 12% compared with the previous year.  From figures I have heard, retail activity has reduced by even more than that.  There is a direct link between the demand for travel and the trends in the wider economy.  We are a measure in many ways.  We have done many things to try to attract business.  On a number of the corridors we have done house drops with free tickets and other promotional activity to try to increase use.  While I am sure it has some effect, the person who lost his or her job last week is simply not travelling on the bus this week</p>
          <p eId="para_33">What is the impact on the financial performance?  The company was profitable from 2000 to 2007 after taking account of the PSO payment, which is one of the lowest for an urban operator in Europe as confirmed by Deloitte.  We made a profit of €4.8 million in 2007.  We had budgeted for a small profit in 2008, but the outcome was a loss of €9.6 million as a result of the recession.  We were down by approximately €11 million on what we expected because of the recession.  The projected loss this year will be much worse — €31.5 million — unless action is taken quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">We expect to have a revenue loss of €18 million.  This time last year when we were planning for 2009 we expected a continued growth in customer numbers.  Instead we are now budgeting for a further 5% decrease because of the other economic forecasts for retail activity, unemployment etc.  We do not know how accurate that will be — time will tell.  We will do everything we can to try to attract business.  There is a fuel rebate loss of €22 million.  That is an EU-related issue.  That goes directly from the bottom line.  If the wage increase were paid, the total cost of wage increases this year would be €10.5 million.  We got a fare increase that will yield €13 million.  However, that is virtually eliminated by the fuel rebate.  Along with the other add-on costs the projected loss becomes €31.5 million.  There are other cost increases in the area of materials etc. that I have not included.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">To deal with the problem we introduced a cost effectiveness plan.  Cost reductions will be implemented across every part of the company at all levels.  There will be reductions in every area.  The pay increase is being deferred.  There will be a staff reduction of 290 from 3,828 to 3,538, including 160 drivers with the balance being staff in other areas of the company.  There will be a fleet reduction of 10% and work practice changes will be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Our service changes will reflect the reduced demand as a result of the recession and loss of passengers to Luas and rail services.  They are essential to deal with the financial problems.  I emphasise we will continue to operate a fleet of more than 1,000 on more than 200 routes.  We will continue to provide a service that will be adequate to cater for the demand at both peak and off-peak.  It will mean a better use of resources at a time when numbers have decreased.  We have a responsibility to do that.  The scheduled changes are in line with the approach as recommended by Deloitte.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The Chairman asked about the nature of the changes.  Generally speaking it is a reduction of frequency on routes.  Some smaller routes are being eliminated.  One comes to mind where the average number travelling on the bus is between five and six.  There is an alternative much more frequent service within five minutes walk of any point where that service is being provided.  In that instance we propose to eliminate the service.  There are some examples of that.  In all cases reasonable alternatives are available.  Where we reduce the frequency, it is more than adequate to cater for demand.  A typical change to the frequency would be from ten minutes to approximately 12 to 15 minutes, but still adequate to cater for demand.  If numbers are reducing we need to deal with it and make best use of the resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The downturn has been experienced in all parts of the city.  There are no select areas where it has not been experienced.  Pretty well all corridors are affected to some degree.  The corridors where the Luas lines are are affected a bit more because the reduction in numbers has been more extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The Deloitte report was launched recently.  I have summarised its findings as best I can in the presentation.  Its general findings were that the company is generally as efficient as comparable organisations.  It found that operational, engineering and administration costs are in line with comparators.  It also found that the public service obligation compensation — the PSO payment we provide to ensure there is a service from Monday to Sunday from early morning to late evening and adequate services at peak times — is very low compared with many other operators.  Ours is less than 30%.  The report mentioned a number of operators that receive a payment of 50% or even 60%.  These findings mean that Dublin Bus is a cost-effective organisation with a good revenue yield.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Another benchmark is to assess the loading on buses.  For 2006, before the recession, Imperial College London carried out an assessment of a number of operators across Europe and further afield.  This study had a measure for measuring the average load per bus on the network.  It considered passengers, vehicles, revenue and kilometres.  We were second, beaten to first by a nose and all the rest were behind us.  This is a well-used network and the buses are on routes where they are most used.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Deloitte identified several issues in respect of the network which has been built up over years.  The city is spread out, with many routes and many legs built up over a long period.  Deloitte stated that the network was complex, with too many route legs and with scope for combined scheduling.  It considered a particular corridor, to which we will refer later.  It suggested more bus priorities, which everyone including the Chairman has been pushing for, and where there could be less variability in journey times.  Deloitte highlighted enormous variability in journey times, where a journey of 1 km might take 12 minutes on one day and 40 minutes on another.  That such variations can occur is the major problem.  We need to give reliable information at intermediate points on the cross city routes so that people know better when buses are coming.  We are developing the automatic vehicle location system and real time passenger information will also be of enormous help there.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Regarding more direct routes of the type we have implemented in recent years such as the 128 to the north fringe and the 151 to Adamstown, where there is regular frequency and direct corridors, Deloitte believed this was the way to go.  The company supports examining the network and existing corridors and streamlining to simplify the number of routes.  I refer to bus stop information and the development of a journey planner.  We took the initiative to develop a journey planner for all modes of transport and we plan to launch it in late spring or early summer.  If someone wants to travel from Blanchardstown to Blackrock, the person can enter the destination information and will be advised of the best mode of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Deloitte obviously highlighted other service issues, such as city centre congestion and the support for our campaign for a bus gate.  We were advised to accelerate the quality bus corridor programme as much as possible and to get priority for buses at traffic lights.  That is being built into the automatic vehicle location system that we are developing.  We are in discussion with Dublin City Council on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">Deloitte also referred to the need for demand management and congestion charging, an issue that has been discussed.  We should move away from cash.  We are conscious that we have a high proportion of cash payers and we seek to move away from that.  We have prepared various fare structure proposals that would enable it.  It will happen with the introduction of integrated ticketing.  That will provide real time passenger information.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I refer to a number of points on the Finglas case study.  The route network has five route variations, 40, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, built up over time.  The proposal is to have two routes to the Finglas area.  It is proposed that there will be a reduction of seven buses at peak times and 17 buses at off-peak times to achieve cost efficiencies.  This is a reflection of the financial situation in which we are.  Deloitte brought the case study to a certain point with us but more work needs to be done and communication is required.  No matter how lightly used bus services are, no one in the area served by the bus and no public representative of that area wants to have it taken away.  We have come up against that difficulty over the years and have tried to provide the most comprehensive service we could, within the public service obligation envelope we had.  In the current economic situation there must be a review.  The Deloitte report is timely from that point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I refer to the issues in the immediate future.  We must restore financial stability.  It is the responsibility of the board and management of Dublin Bus to do so, to propose and implement the best combination of proposals.  There must be strategic reform of the route network, examining the structure of routes, as recommended by Deloitte.  The key s the continued focus on getting bus priorities.  There is an agreed programme with local authorities over the coming years and we are pushing hard on all pressure points.  The Minister has come in on that point and this committee, and its report issued last summer, led on the issue of the bus gate.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">We must implement an automatic vehicle location system, which will give real time information on mobile phones and on the web.  The next step is to provide it on displays at bus stops.  This project will be managed by Dublin City Council, to ensure there is an open system.  The council will push it ahead as fast as possible.  We are on course to deliver the Dublin Bus element of it, with the automatic vehicle location system in operation, next year.  The first pilot route will be used this autumn.  We must implement the integrated ticketing system.  We have a smart card, which was introduced last summer, and all our buses are fitted for the integrated system and the smart card.  We are working closely with the project board at the Rail Procurement Agency under its independent chairman on the development of this.  We are committed to it.  We are also working on the development of information at bus stops with intermediate timings.  We have launched a new format, adopting the transport for London format.  This has proved very popular and the information format is now on all city centre stops.  More work must be done on detail but it has proved to be popular.  It sets out information on routes in a clearer way.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_48">This committee has put emphasis on bus transport in Ireland as our first priority, particularly in respect of commuter services to Dublin and Dublin city services.  We concentrated much time and effort on the report we produced.  It is greatly disappointing to hear the cutbacks proposed by both companies.  I recognise the difficulties with reducing numbers, the difficult financial situation and the responsibilities of the management of Dublin Bus to run a company that is solvent but it is disappointing to hear the news announced recently and confirmed today.  Both companies have not succeeded in changing this country's car dependency culture and therefore they have not succeeded in popularising the bus.  This committee has supported Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus as our primary bus transport companies.  We have been most anxious to see the companies develop.  The thrust of our report on Dublin Bus suggested more buses on the streets, running more freely and frequently and providing an answer to the congestion problems in Dublin.  Will Mr. Hayes provide an example of the routes which will be withdrawn?  Is it possible in this exercise to give people living in areas where routes are not being used an opportunity to use or lose their bus service?  Notwithstanding that the economic downturn has reduced the number of people using bus services, the good value provided by the bus service in Dublin will surely act as an incentive for people to switch from the car to the bus, especially when oil prices reach their peak.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I put it to Mr. Meagher that Dublin Bus has not made a serious effort to achieve greater bus use in the capital.  The company's response to the report of the joint committee was disappointing.  We did not hear a word from it about the report and we did not hear it make any serious objection regarding the continuing procrastination by Dublin City Council on the need to reroute traffic from the city centre to facilitate bus transport.  The monopoly position of Dublin Bus must be called into question if it is not able to provide a comprehensive service in the capital.  While the company has 148 million passengers, this figure is small in comparison with total passenger movements in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Will the No. 92 bus service in Dublin continue?  Approximately 10% of rail passengers using Heuston Station take the 90, 91 or 92 bus service, whereas 90% of them take the Luas.  Given that the Luas line from Heuston to Connolly Station does not offer great possibilities, travelling as it does across O'Connell Street, why do 90% of passengers using Heuston Station use the Luas and only 10% Dublin Bus services?  We put this question to representatives of Dublin Bus previously and made suggestions on how to rectify the matter but it appears no action was taken.  Surely it is not beyond the possibilities of marketing that Iarnród Éireann trains and Bus Éireann vehicles would feature advertisements for Dublin Bus.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I put it to Mr. Meagher that Dublin Bus is taking the soft option by making 290 people redundant.  The company and its unions must have other options for increasing the number of bus passengers.  One need only visit College Green this evening to see no more than two or three people on the top deck of Dublin Bus vehicles.  I do not accept Mr. Meagher's case that the company cannot increase the number of bus passengers due to the economic downturn.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">To make a general point, the Dublin Bus network receives one of the lowest subventions in Europe and has one of the highest loadings per bus in Europe.  These figures reflect a very efficient and effective operation by Dublin Bus.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_53">Mr. Meagher covered that issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_54">Yes.  We have one of the highest loadings in Europe.  I and my predecessors have appeared before this committee more than once.  In terms of developing and increasing the number of people using the bus service, more effective quality bus corridors are planned.  Everybody is supportive of this goal.  The Stillorgan corridor offers a model for change, with high frequency and reliability through a high level of priority.  We have this priority on the Stillorgan route as far as St. Stephen's Green but not through the city centre.  Once such priority is provided, one can secure modal shift.  Our programme of increasing the fleet was aimed at achieving this outcome.  In 2007, for example, we commenced a number of direct routes, including on the Malahide Road and from Condalkin, with precisely this aim.  These routes have done well.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">In terms of securing priority for buses, Dublin Bus, with the local authorities, has driven a programme of priorities on all the key corridors.  We have also been extremely active and vocal with the local authorities on the need to secure agreement on priority programmes.  While it may not have made headlines in the newspapers, Dublin Bus has been engaged in considerable activity with the local authorities to achieve priorities.  We have discussed this issue on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">In 2007, we added buses to the fleet and were looking forward to growth.  The global recession hit us like everybody else like a thunderbolt.  We had planned to expand services, rather than cutting them back.  However, we are faced with a financial problem with which we must try to deal in the most effective manner possible.  We are introducing a number of measures.  All Dublin Bus staff are suffering as no pay award will be forthcoming.  We will also change the level of service provided on routes affected by the recession.  This is an appropriate response to the problem we have and makes better use of the resources available to us.  In parallel with these measures, we are developing on a number of fronts.  For example, an automatic vehicle location system will enable customers to receive real time information and an integrated ticketing system is being developed with the project board and Railway Procurement Agency.  We are improving information.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Dublin Bus, like everyone else, wants the recession to end quickly to enable the company to move again.  As the economy grows, the number of people travelling to work, shopping and socialising will increase and Dublin Bus will be in a position to cater for this growth.  We also hope developing areas such as Adamstown and the northern fringe will grow again and that the company will be in an even stronger position to respond to such growth.  Nevertheless, the board has a responsibility to maintain financial stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">While I accept the Chairman's point on the issue of trains, Dublin Bus places significant advertising on the trains and also advertises on radio.  As with other companies, we have a budget which we must try to use to best effect.  We had a programme of generic corporate advertising to try to attract to the service those who do not use buses.  We have invested substantially in household drops offering a free bus ticket to try to reach people who do not use the bus.  We have been doing all these things and working very hard in this area.  Our advertising this year will be more focused on giving value for money to try to attract more customers and less focused on generic advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">When one has a €31.5 million problem arising from a loss of revenue and the loss of the fuel duty rebate, one has responsibility to deal with it.  We have to manage our finances.  That is basically the position.</p>

          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_65">We plan to reduce services significantly on the 90 route, while strengthening services on the 92 route because it provides a different type of service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_66">I thank the Chairman and members for supporting the promotion of bus services.  Bus Éireann has done a great deal in this regard.  For example, double deck coaches travel along the Navan Road on the Galway route every 15 minutes at peak times.  This was a great success and we provided higher frequency services with bus lanes.  It is not all a question of contraction.  There are areas of growth and we are chasing those.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">We have expanded our network.  The current timetable is twice the size of the one from 20 years ago.  I have examples to show committee members.  I have been involved in Bus Éireann for the past 30 years.  In that time we have built up an extensive network.  Having built that up over many years, the last thing in the world I want is a curtailment in the network.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">To give some indication of the type of services we must examine, first, we must consider load factors across the board where the revenue is low.  In many cases a reduction in frequency may be the answer.  I was in Cork two weeks ago and it was very quiet.  The traffic, which is normally quite bad there, was moving and very few people were shopping.  I will not give away any detail without talking to staff but where one has two good frequency routes and a low frequency route sandwiched in between them, if one took out that route it would mean people would have to walk for five minutes to access a good higher frequency service.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">On the long distance services, Deloitte referred to the advent of motorways and the difficulty of maintaining secondary locations.  The cross-country routes going away from the main centres are the ones more under pressure.  There are rural and provincial services where one can reduce frequency.  Some routes have very small loads.  I refer to four or five people.  We will consider all the options available to see whether we can salvage or turn around any of those services.  We will consider the amalgamation of routes.  We will be innovative in the way we approach the issue.  We very much agree with what is contained in the Deloitte report which covers many of those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">While we must retrench, as soon as the economy turns around we want to be able to expand again.  We have made huge strides, especially in the past seven or eight years, through the national development plan and Government support in Transport 21.  Having put in so much effort, the last thing in the world we want is to turn back and curtail services.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_71">I welcome the delegations from Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann and thank them for their submissions.  Anything I say will not be a personal criticism of anybody.  I respect the integrity and professionalism of the two organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The Deloitte report is like a report card for both of the operations.  The report indicates that Bus Éireann's schedule and network design and operation are largely efficient.  Having discussed the network, it is evident Bus Éireann interacts a lot with private enterprise, where possible.  There appears to be a symbiotic relationship between the company and the private sector where they operate in tandem.  The private sector takes some Bus Éireann routes when they are available.  The company appears to work in an efficient and effective way and it provides choice, in so far as that is possible to the traveller.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The figures from Iarnród Éireann are interesting in that there is no reduction in income to it in the last quarter of 2008, nor has there been a reduction in the number of passengers being carried.  Whatever we say about the recession, it does not appear to be affecting Iarnród Éireann in the same way that bus numbers are affected.  There may be lessons to be learned from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">With respect to Dublin Bus, the report is extremely critical of the operation of that company.  Taxpayers fund the company to the tune of €85 million per year through the public service obligation.  A loss of €80 million is being predicted in the current year.  That is a serious situation.  The report clearly identifies that on one specific generic route — the Finglas route — to which reference was made, savings of 17% of operational costs could be made.  If that was applied to the 14 other routes, through the way Dublin Bus operates, it could save €30 million.  The company has not enunciated fully what is outlined in the 11 recommendations, although some of them are referred to.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">Dublin Bus is in a dominant monopoly position and one assistant secretary at the Department of Transport found that the company was abusing its dominant position in the marketplace to compete unfairly with the private sector.  That is a serious issue.  I have a copy of the Government plans from the year 2000 to open up competition and choice in the bus market and to provide a new regulatory system in the greater Dublin area for more buses, competition and choice, which is clearly not happening.  The key question to Dublin Bus is how it will address competition.  Is it prepared to operate with private bus operators in the city of Dublin who could considerably help the company meet the requirements of the public and to reduce the losses it will incur?</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Will Mr. Meagher respond specifically to the recommendation in the Deloitte report on the redeployment of peak-only buses from Harristown, the introduction of intermediate timing points, the elimination of out-of-service running to facilitate driver breaks, and the elimination of routes operating to garages with no apparent customer demand?  The above programme of work represents fundamental changes for the company.  It should be treated as a major change and transformation programme.  I cannot accept that anything Mr. Meagher has said today includes a fundamental, major change to be introduced.  He referred to the loss of employees, a cutback in services and at the same time the company is not changing in a fundamental way.  That is a severe criticism and I would like to hear Mr. Meagher's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">First, I will deal with the Deloitte report.  The primary findings of that report are that Dublin Bus is generally as efficient as comparable organisations.  Operational, engineering and administration costs are in line with comparators.  Public service obligation compensation is relatively low compared with comparable operations in other countries in Europe.  Those are the facts.  The main issue raised in the report relates to the network and the focus on Finglas that involves reducing five routes to two and a reduction of seven buses at peak and 17 buses in off-peak.  If that proposal were implemented fully, it would mean a considerable diminution in the number of buses and people who are employed.</p>

That is not reducing services; it is enhancing them.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_39">
          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_100">That is a very sensible approach.  We are adopting it and have been doing so in line with the network review produced by MVA, a very reputable international company.  All the information on demographic trends and the DTO model was taken fully into account and we developed a business case for the additional buses, which case we submitted to the Department.  It was examined independently and verified and approved for the Department by Goodbody Economic Consultants.  We did our business in a very professional way.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Deloitte is basically stating that the existing network is complex because there are many route legs and that now is the time to consider simplifying and streamlining it.  We certainly support that.  We have tried to do so on several occasions in various areas but nobody in a area where a bus service is provided wants his bus to be taken away.  No public representative wants this.  We provided a service in line with the public service obligation payment over the years.  The recommendation by Deloitte has now been made and we support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">There is no doubt but that issues will arise if five routes are to be reduced to two but there are issues that must be faced and solutions that must be supported by everybody.  The Minister supports the recommendations and we are very anxious to put together a plan to ensure they are implemented.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_40">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_103">I welcome the two delegations warmly.  Before the meeting started, I tried to move a motion to demand that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, would attend today to listen to the delegates and hear this debate.  It is outrageous that he is skulking around Government Buildings and in the Dáil and is not prepared to be here with us.  He has a fundamental role to play.  It is regrettable that he has been using the Green Party as his mudguard over recent months to protect him from the legitimate anger of workers and commuters.  This committee produced its own report on buses, on which I commend the Chairman, but now we find, some months later, that the Minister's action in connection with expenditure on public transport effectively led to his burning and tearing up that report.  That is how much consideration he gave to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Bearing in mind that we are to meet the author of the Deloitte report in some weeks, I must state it is a flawed document in many respects.  It is flawed fundamentally because of the issue that arose in respect of the Finglas corridor.  There is merit in having more simplified routes in some areas and for developing the key corridors, but a problem arises in that doing so will leave large areas without a bus service.  We have witnessed this in Dublin North-East.  Senator Brady and I campaigned a year or so ago to save one of variants of the 31 route, which the company wanted to rationalise because of the small number of people who used it.  However, the users were seniors and school-going kids.  We worked in co-operation with Mr. Matthews in Dublin Bus to save it.  What we were campaigning against highlights one of the problems with the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The Deloitte report does not examine how public service obligations operate abroad.  Page 9 simply states Dublin Bus receives the lowest subsidy by far by comparison with other operators.  The company in Brussels receives a subsidy of 68%, that in Amsterdam receives a subsidy of 62% and that in Lyon, which has a brilliant Luas-type system on which we modelled ours, receives a subsidy of 79%.  In other words, the French Government basically pays for the buses of Lyon, yet this is not discussed in the report.  The author of the report does not investigate the Luas corridors, which matter was rightly raised by the Chairman.  It has been alleged that many people travel for free on the Luas and this is a very interesting point, but the fact is that we must consider the problems that will arise for a bus company when the metro and other fixed-line developments come on stream.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">With regard to the cutbacks in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, why is there no voluntary redundancy scheme?  In the case of Dublin Bus, many young workers with families of two or three kids approached me stating they gave up a job six or nine months ago to work for the company.  Dublin Bus spent approximately €12,000 training each one and now, nine or ten months later, these staff members are, as they see it, being dismissed arbitrarily.  Is that not outrageous and indefensible?</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Labour Party councillors and their constituents in the city and nationally are expressing their concern about certain bus routes, some of which I will mention.  Is it not the case that the 172, in Deputy Áine Brady's territory, and the 123, 19, 13, 13A, 7, 11A, 45, 121, 122, 77, 77A, 50, 150, 56A, 19A and 15A will all suffer from diminished services?  People are concerned that they will have diminished services because of the cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Dublin Bus introduced "Euro buses" to supplement service on very busy corridors and they are operated from Harristown.  Are they to be withdrawn from Harristown, Phibsborough and Conyngham Road?  What will happen at times of peak demand if the "Euro bus" routes are abandoned?  This relates to issues I debated with Deputy O'Dowd.  Will the Nitelink be cancelled from Monday to Thursday?</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann were badly damaged by the fuel rebate, as were the private bus operators.  They could not have done anything about this as it is the responsibility of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">A private company operator stated recently this is too good a crisis not to utilise to secure massive cost efficiencies, as management would see them.  Are the current difficulties being used to force through work practices that management in both Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann have long wanted to adopt?  Are they taking advantage of circumstances?  Are up to 600 young men and women being used cruelly as pawns in the struggle over public transport between the companies and the Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_111">With regard to management, <i>The Irish Times</i> published an editorial called “Wrong Route”, which looks very like the work of Deputy Cuffe.  It seems to be written by somebody in <i>The Irish Times</i> with strong Green sympathies.  Is that not extraordinary?  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_112">What should happen to executives and board members who decline to use the product of their companies?  How can they judge the quality of service being provided, the morale of staff or the need for change [if they do not use the buses themselves]?</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Is that not a grievous slur on the management of Dublin Bus?  Do any of the senior managers of both companies use the buses?</p>
          <p eId="para_114">It has often been said to me by Bus Éireann drivers that the company expanded its senior management team greatly in recent years, from approximately 45 to 120.  Although services in Cork, Limerick and Galway are being developed, why was this expansion necessary?  For example, I heard an allegation that a senior manager for the network and business planning division of Bus Éireann had been appointed without holding a competition.  These are some of the flabby management issues that have emerged.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">Regarding staff not being retained and why there is no voluntary severance scheme, leaving staff go is regrettable.  When we recruited them, we did so on the basis that we would be using them in expanding services.  The world, however, has changed in the past year for everyone and we have to deal with this.  There will be 290 job reductions in the company.  Of these, 190 are temporary staff; the other 100 will go through voluntary severance arrangements.  The funding to keep them on is simply not available.  We hope that in a reasonably short period we will be expanding services and recruiting again.  We should also be recruiting to deal with natural wastage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_117">We do not have funds for major voluntary severance schemes in Dublin Bus.  Staff are being laid off across the company in every area.  Anyone in a temporary position, no matter what area they are in, will not be reappointed.  We do not have the work for them in current circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Deputy Broughan referred to several routes which will be affected.  We will be maintaining the level of service that will be needed to deal with demand.  Some euro buses will be coming off routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Fewer people are going to work.  A person who lost his or her job last week will not be travelling on the bus this week.  We have to adapt the level of service to cater for this.  On certain routes — the Deputy mentioned the No. 172 bus — only five and six passengers on average are loading.  There is an alternative service operating on an adjacent route.  While one can maintain that service in good times, it certainly cannot be maintained now.  Numbers using the Nitelink service on Monday to Thursday are small and we cannot continue with the cost of providing the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The Irish Times recently contained an unfair article in which there were many items that were not true.  One was that Dublin Bus senior management did not use its services.  Senior management personnel in Dublin Bus use them a heck of a lot.</p>

          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_123">At a previous committee meeting I made the point that in Europe Ireland had the highest growth rate in bus passenger numbers per kilometre.  Ireland is outperforming every other country in Europe in the growth in passenger numbers.  This has been built over a number of years, particularly with improvements since the beginning of the NDP.  We are not starting from a weak position as we have expanded considerably.  However, the economy is down and everyone is affected.  If passengers are not going to work or shopping, we are affected.  Multinational and UK bus companies have seen the same downturn and are cutting back and leaving workers go.  We have a tight financial position and have always used our funding to keep services going.  Our first commitment is to keep as many services as possible going within the envelope from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The Deputy referred to the management team.  Somebody is not being fair to us.  In the past ten years driver numbers in the company have increased by 40% because services have expanded, while other staff numbers have been reduced by 10%.  We invested in some staff for particular reasons such as safety and training.  One of my priorities has been to concentrate on safety.  We restructured the company, consolidating nine areas into five regions, bringing in professionals such as accountants and engineers to strengthen the management team, while others left.  In the overall scheme we did make savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">I do not understand the Deputy's point about making an appointment without holding a competition.  We have always held interviews and there are appointment processes in place.  In many cases, we have used independent assessments for external appointments or internal promotions.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I welcome the delegations from Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  One point made by the trade unions in their correspondence with the committee is that, bearing in mind the workforce has substantially increased, there will be an increase in the numbers using buses because workplace parking has become expensive and, with access to credit curtailed, the number of car purchases will decrease.  What is the delegation's view on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The trade unions also highlight the scope for significant costs savings in Bus Éireann and warn the company to be careful not to undermine the entire integrated network.  They find it difficult to see how management can justify a proposal to reduce its staff numbers and fleet by 150 when it should be increasing it.  Have the companies assessed any schemes to get people from the car to the bus?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_50">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_130">I welcome the presentations by both delegations.  They have been before the committee before in better times but today they have been very much upfront, in laying down a comprehensive assessment as to how they will deal with difficult economic circumstances.  Other organisations tend to leak information to the public slowly.  The upfront approach is better and also more helpful to politicians.  Mr. Hayes and his team have always been helpful to Members on local issues concerning bus routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The Deloitte report recognised management had succeeded in realigning the company with best practice which will put it in a good position to deal with the downturn.  Where possible, management should be sensitive in dealing with services to isolated rural areas.  While Mr. Meagher has identified cost cuttings with alternative adjacent routes in Dublin, that is not the case in rural areas.  I ask Mr. Hayes, if possible, to try to engage with local community leaders through the political process to ascertain how the cuts he clearly envisages may least burden those who are isolated most.  I should welcome any structure or framework his local organisations might have in that regard.  I want to pay tribute, not just to the people in head office but also those in the regions and the drivers and inspectors on the ground who work tirelessly to ensure passengers get to their destinations.  We must give credit where it is due in that regard.  Many of them are deeply pained by the type of cost cutting that will have to take place because they are attuned to the livelihoods of the people they are working with.  I know Mr. Hayes shares in this and I should be obliged if he would put some type of structure in place towards helping to collectively find the best solution.  He has our best wishes in the efforts he has to make.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_51">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_132">I do not know whether to puke or thank people.  However, I am sick and tired of listening to Government members saying we must look at cost cutting.  I have looked for the last 12 years at every announcement.  We saw Government Deputies with Ministers wearing hard hats cutting the ribbon as regards the Sligo services.  Other Deputies and Senators along that line did not even know about it.  Fair play to Mr. Tim Hayes for the Bus Éireann services from the north west to Dublin Airport.  I hesitate to say anything about the north-west initiative on the grounds that the Minister would announce it.  It was not going to be released, although he hardly knew where the north-west was.  Fair play to Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus.  They actually have very professional management teams.  I, along with the Chairman, went along to see how the Bus Éireann team operates, and I must say that over the years it has provided a very good service.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">However, it is quite clear that the cutbacks will affect the way Bus Éireann delivers its services.  One area where it has been hoodwinked by the Government is the fuel rebate which I, along with many others, have highlighted.  Despite the fact that it fell foul of European law the Minister was saying over 18 months that a mechanism would be put in place so that this rebate could be reinstated.  That rebate is gone since last November, for Dublin Bus it was worth up to €12 million and for Bus Éireann, €10 million.  That is a major loss to Mr. Hayes's revenue, and on that basis alone, it is quite obvious that services will be cut.  That has nothing to do with the downturn in the economy.  It is a major decrease.  Will Mr. Hayes outline whether this has been made up in any other way by Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I am very concerned as regards rural routes.  Mr. Hayes said that some would be affected.  Not too many have been unaffected in the last ten years.  Routes have been cut in that period which were taken up by rural transport initiatives around the country.  I am very concerned that these rural routes are, effectively, from town to town.  They are not as rural as Mr. Hayes is actually making them out to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">As regards non-Irish nationals, I should like to know what percentage were using those routes, because I believe it was very high and that the company will take a serious hit in that regard.  I notice that 150 buses, or 10% of Bus Éireann's fleet, will probably be mothballed and put into cold storage, along with 100 from Dublin Bus.  That is an enormous amount of infrastructure, which the taxpayer has paid for.  What will be the average cost of the 250 buses to be mothballed.  Will it be like the e-voting machines?  Will they be sold off or put into cold storage, and what will the costs be?  We do not know how long this initiative will last and it is a national disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">I have one other area of major concern, namely, school transport, which Bus Éireann operates.  School transport has gone up from €99 per student four times this year to €300 in less than a year.  Does Mr. Hayes find that many people are looking at different ways to send their children to school, because €300 is outrageous.  Effectively it is a 203% increase?  As the provider of school transport, does he not believe this to be anti-rural, anti-family and exorbitant?</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I was very impressed by the management teams in Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus.  However, if we want to have public transport, there must be a public service obligation and it must be real.  The fuel rebate was, in effect, a three-card trick that was pulled on the public transport companies and the private operators which has not been addressed by Government, and I am sick of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_52">
          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_138">I shall try to cover all the points raised by members.  As regards the efficiency of the company, it was mentioned that there might be other cost savings.  Deloitte is very clear as to the fact that ours is an efficient operation.  It concedes that we have an ongoing cost-saving programme in place.  Before we made any cuts, there were €6 million in savings last year, equivalent to 4% of our cost base, with a more radical cost-saving programme to be introduced as well.  The consultants said that despite all that we would still need to make further economies, given the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">A point was raised as regards advertising and promotion.  To summarise, last year we had six radio advertising programmes throughout the country aimed at encouraging people to change from the car to the bus, given the rising fuel costs, parking charges and so forth.  We undertook a major campaign aimed at students last autumn, which proved to be very successful.  Our revenue rose significantly in that area.  We went into more than 30 colleges around the country and it was a comprehensive campaign.  We also engaged a good deal in local community third party initiatives aimed at getting people to use buses.  We had a shopping campaign in tandem with Athlone shopping centre, for example, and we had programmes running in the summer to test park and ride services to various matches.  This was very innovative, using GAA grounds around Dublin such as Naas, Wicklow, etc.  We provided extra services to Thomond Park when the new stadium was opened.  The initiative there was aimed at persuading more people to travel to rugby matches by bus.  We are putting up an extra 200 shelters, which will enable us to provide better information and more comfort for customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">We plan to have the real time information service in place by the middle of this year.  This will be a major marketing initiative, aimed at encouraging people to use buses.  Most of our customers go online now for information.  Ours is the tenth most used website in the country.  For example, if people in Westport want to travel to Dungarvan, they can instantly see all the buses they need to take and where to make the connections, along with the cost of the through fare.  For example, last year some 28 people travelled from Westport to Dungarvan, and 28 from there to Ballybofey, on a three or four buses, getting a through ticket in each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">We have done a great deal to persuade the public to travel more regularly on buses.  As I have said, we have been outperforming the rest of Europe in terms of passenger number growth, and this is reflected in the Deloitte report.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I thank Deputy Dooley for his comments and assure him we are aware that we have to be sensitive.  I come from a rural area and nobody wants to see services cut.  We have excellent staff on the ground who provide services in rural areas and we shall certainly engage in that process.  Unfortunately, given the economic situation, certain areas of our activity will have to be adjusted.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">Let us take the route from Kilrush to Ennis or from Lettermore to Galway.  Those are routes that Mr. Hayes has identified where Bus Éireann is not getting the business.  If a service is not being supported, it is difficult to leave it in place.  Is there anything the company can do, before taking away services?  Can it inform people living in the area that if they will not use the bus, the service will go?  Can they be given a chance to use it or lose it?  We would encourage such a move.  I have no problem with the removal of a bus service when it is simply not being supported.  The same applies to Dublin Bus.  It is not a charity service we are providing, although there is a public service obligation, which is very important.  I ask Bus Éireann to consider this as part of its rationalisation plan.</p>

          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_153">We have three sources of income for provincial services, namely, State support — the level of which has increased — revenue generated from customer numbers and the generation of profits on commercial routes which we have used to cross-subsidise to the tune of 20% to 25% the loss-making rural services.  The levels of the latter two streams have fallen because customer numbers have fallen, which has affected us badly.  We must work in the current climate.  Everybody will accept that there are limited funds and that we must make the best use of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The Deputy also spoke about rural services.  I am not aware that we have cut back on them to any great extent in my time and I have been in Bus Éireann for 20 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Many rural services have been reduced from being provided seven days to one or two days a week.  The rural service is still in place, but it is no longer effective.  Let us be honest.  Bus Éireann is not providing the rural service it claims.  It is not a service, in providing a service one day a week it is just meeting the company's obligation.  Am I right in saying this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_65">
          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_156">I have compared services provided in counties Kerry and Mayo in the past 20 years and the total number has gone up.  We provided some low cost rural services five or six years ago.  If they were not used, we curtailed them.  If we have cut back services from five days to three days a week, it is because the level of support has declined.  There has been a greater increase in car ownership in rural areas.  The population has not grown in rural areas but in the bigger towns and cities.  For example, there might be growth in Carrick-on-Shannon, but there will not be a similar growth rate in rural areas.  We are conscious of this and endeavour to maintain services.  With the State, we were using the cross-subsidy to keep local services going.  We no longer have that benefit because of the economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">On school transport, we cascade most of the vehicles used.  The vehicles in question are seven, eight or nine years old and we remove those which are 20 years old.  However, they will not be mothballed because they can be put to good use.  Otherwise, we would end up buying second-hand vehicles for school services at some stage.  We are now able to increase the number and improve the age profile on the school transport side.  I accept that rates have increased significantly recently but they did not increase for a number of years before this.  There will be further increases.  The school transport scheme has been improved and expanded considerably during the years.  Compared with what it was ten years ago, it is a far better service with a much better fleet.</p>

          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_158">Senator Brady made a couple of points.  The first was on the car to bus issue.  We have done free ticket drops to households on a number of corridors in order to entice commuters to move to buses.  There was specific advertising on the radio when fuel prices were high last year in order to get people to move from the car to the bus.  We will continue to do this in the best way possible.  However, a couple of things have gone against us.  Car prices have fallen significantly — second-hand cars are very cheap.  When our services have priority, we can do much faster times.  It recently has been the case that congestion has reduced, with the result that some people can be attracted back to their cars.  We will certainly be working very hard to attract them away from their cars all the time.  Ultimately, the way to do this is by offering high frequency and high priority services.  That is the proven model.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Buses are not being mothballed.  We replace 100 buses in our fleet each year.  However, we will not be doing this in 2009.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I have four questions for Mr. Meagher.  I have much experience in dealing with Dublin Bus, especially with Mr. Gareth Quinn who runs many of the services on the northside of Dublin.  I compliment the company on the quality of the responses I have received when I have had reason to contact it.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">My first question concerns frequency reduction.  When will Dublin Bus be making clear what services will suffer reduced frequency of service?  Can Dublin Bus give a guarantee that all possible will be done to ensure Nitelink services are not affected more than is necessary, given that they are relied upon, especially by people working in the city late at night?</p>
          <p eId="para_184">With regard to the cutbacks announced, my specific question is whether this is final.  Is Dublin Bus confident the package it has put out to its employees and the public will not need to be revised and that further cutbacks or reductions in the bus fleet will not be needed?</p>
          <p eId="para_185">My third question concerns subcontracting.  I know this is something Bus Éireann identifies as a way of providing further services in the future.  Will there be any opportunity to use subcontracting within Dublin Bus, particularly for some of the services that are being lost?</p>
          <p eId="para_186">My final question relates to the many reforms outlined in the Deloitte report, which Dublin Bus has indicated its commitment to implement.  Was an opportunity missed by not doing this work earlier when the times were good and the economy was doing better?  If those reforms had been implemented, surely it would not need to make the cutbacks it now needs to make.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_187">I welcome the delegates.  A number of my questions have been asked so I will not go back over them.  Given the provision of bus lanes and bus corridors, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann increased efficiencies, especially from commuter belt areas such as the one I represent in north Kildare.  There were problems with the use of buses due to the upgrade of the M50, M4 and the N4 Newcastle interchange.  Now that this has been completed, we should be re-emphasising the efficiencies arising from the use of bus lanes.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">With that in mind, Mr. Meagher and Mr. Hayes referred to marketing.  Has thought been given to a commuter belt bus day where, say, a 30% discount would be given to commuters from the commuter belt?  This would be used to entice new commuters and let them see that efficiencies are in place because the major roadworks, which were an annoyance and took many people off the buses at the time, are complete.  This might bring them back on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I compliment both companies on their proposals for the automatic vehicle location, AVL, and real time information.  Will they be able to continue with this roll-out given the downturn in the economy?  How do they envisage the future position?  With regard to bus park and ride facilities, are the companies still in negotiation with the local authorities and Iarnród Éireann on a common approach to such facilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The Deloitte report on Dublin Bus stated that network design and scheduling of drivers on buses should be led by the requirements of the passenger and that services should be both integrated and simple.  Given that everyone looks after their own bailiwick, I note that when Dublin Bus has reformed commuter belt routes, issues have arisen with regard to the loss of a private bus company in north Kildare.  I know Dublin Bus has tried to improve the services but I hope we will maintain as many of those services as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKennedy" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_191">I welcome the Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann representatives.  Mr. Meagher referred to the Luas and passengers having a choice, particularly coming from train stations.  I do not believe Dublin Bus should be competing with the Luas.  As a north side Deputy, I am very envious of south siders.  They have the DART service and the Luas, which are excellent services, and they have a reasonably good bus service.  Dublin Bus as an organisation should not be endeavouring to overlap and compete against them because I do not think it will win, as its statistics prove.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I am speaking more with regard to Dublin Bus than Bus Éireann because I have more contact and experience with it.  I compliment Dublin Bus because, overall, its service has improved and the commitment of the staff and management is there.  I know management now responds to public representatives.  When one makes contact, one gets an acknowledgement in a reasonably quick time, not necessarily the answer one is seeking but at least the issue is checked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I have a few suggestions and criticisms.  With regard to increasing Dublin Bus passenger numbers, I made major representations for Dublin Bus to use the tunnel for the 41X service from Swords to the city.  In fact, I drove around Swords with officials from the Department of Transport to identify a route that was not in conflict with the private operator, Swords Express.  That service is now up and running and is operating well, but it is only a good service in the mornings.  Why has Dublin Bus not sought sanction from the Department of Transport to use the port tunnel on the reverse journey from the city to Swords in the evening?</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I received a communication today from a person who always uses the 41X.  I realise it was snowy and rainy on Monday evening last and there would obviously be a much slower through time from the city to Swords.  She got the 5.15 p.m. bus in the city on Monday and arrived in Swords at 8.10 p.m.  Yesterday, Tuesday, she decided to use the Swords Express service and left work at the same time.  The Swords Express came through the tunnel and she arrived in Swords at 6.05 p.m.  That lady tells me she is a lost customer to Dublin Bus unless it seeks that licence from the Department of Transport.  She asked me to put pressure on Dublin Bus.  I want to ask the Dublin Bus representatives a very direct question.  Given that it got its licence to use the tunnel in the morning, why not seek a licence for the evening?</p>
          <p eId="para_195">With no disrespect to Senator Brady and Deputy Broughan, I wish to refer to the 128 bus service from Clongriffin on the northern fringe which operates beside the Donaghmede service.  Although in future years it will be a massive development, the area currently has about 200 occupied houses, yet it has a bus service every 10 minutes.  At the same time, Holywell, beside Swords, has more than 2,000 houses but just has the 142 service operating from Portmarnock through Malahide and then through Holywell.  While it now has four services in the morning, there is significant potential for Dublin Bus to increase passenger numbers if it provided a better service to Holywell which has in excess of 2,000 houses.  People are driving to Holywell to park their cars because they want to pick up that bus going through the tunnel in the morning, which is causing its own problems with local residents.  Dublin Bus does not have an evening service for that area, although the potential numbers exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">With regard to the 43 service, which serves the Kinsealy to Drynam Hall area, there are nearly 1,000 extra houses but it still has the traditional 43 service which goes through Feltrim and along the Malahide Road.  While Dublin Bus talks of declining passenger numbers, there is potential for an increase.  I hope it will consider what I am saying in the context of its revised services.  The 128 service is wasted.  Ten minutes after the morning peak, nobody is on the bus.</p>

Connectivity with the DART and Drogheda commuter services is required.  Clearly, Dublin Bus cannot compete with these services but why is it not providing what I call a nipper bus service from Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk and Rush?  Some 10,000 new residents have moved to Lusk and Rush in recent years.  The figures show that such a service would provide a good source of revenue for Dublin Bus.</p>

On the question of whether there will be additional cutbacks, we are expecting a further decrease in passenger numbers of 5%, which seems a sensible approach based on the various forecasts available to us.  We are hopeful this will be the extent of it and that various measures taken will mean that the recession will flatten out and that we can move forward.  If that proves to be the case, there will be no more cutbacks.  However, if further major problems arise as a consequence of the recession, we will have to take this on board.  We will put together a plan on the basis of the best information we have.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">Regarding earlier reforms, we spoke a little about this in terms of changing routes, legs of routes and so on.  My colleague, Mr. Matthews, was involved in the process of negotiation on the Finglas route, for example, which involved attending meetings in the area.  His proposals included several of those subsequently recommended by Deloitte.  At the time, however, there was massive opposition to these proposals.  The general request from the local representatives was that we seek to maintain the existing service.  In general, we have maintained a network of services, maximising the number of off-peak bus services in line with our memorandum of understanding with the Department and extending to as many areas as we possibly can within the envelope of the public service obligation.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I assure Deputy Brady that we intend to continue with the automatic vehicle location system.  We are fully committed to its implementation.  The Deputy asked about efforts to entice M50 commuters to use the bus service.  We intend to engage in a significant level of such activity, including house drops and various forms of local advertising.  On several corridors we have given a free ticket to every household.  We are also considering running certain day promotions in the coming months to promote business and entice passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I agree with the Deputy in that we do not see ourselves as competing with the Luas service and reforms of our services will keep this very much in mind.  We do not consider it appropriate that we should compete with the Luas service, in which a substantial investment has been made.  The moves we plan to make in regard to the 90, 91 and 92 bus routes will reflect this.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">In regard to the 41X route, we applied for the evening service but approval was not granted.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">The Deputy made an interesting point regarding the 128 bus route.  We introduced this route with the specific purpose of dealing with capacity issues on the Malahide Road, in regard to which it is proving successful, and also to ensure the service was in place before the development at Clongriffin was intensely populated.  The point was made many times that as new areas were developed, bus services were put in place only after residents had moved in and purchased two cars per household.  As a result, we made a deliberate decision to install our service in a timely fashion and engaged in discussions with the developer regarding facilities for buses and so on.  We tried to do it all by the book.  We introduced a ten-minute service which benefits the service on the Malahide Road and provides a link with the south of the city in line with the network review and the recommendations made in the Deloitte report.  Unfortunately, in the past 12 months or so development in that area has effectively ceased.  We expected far more people to be living there at this stage.  Nevertheless, take-up of the service is good.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">I am sure I will not be immune to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I have a simple message for our guests, which is that reform, rather than cutbacks, is required.  It is possible to effect radical reforms that would dramatically reduce the need for cutbacks in services.  I hope signs of such reform will be forthcoming from Dublin Bus, in particular.  My main concerns lie with it.  While I am impressed by changes in both organisations, I am particularly impressed by changes within Bus Éireann such as the development of a web interface, as a result of which one can buy a ticket from Ballina to Bray on-line.  It is a credit to the company that such a service is available.  I also have been impressed by many of the changes made within it.  I have been involved, while wearing a political hat, with the company for almost 20 years and wish the changes could move along a little faster.  While I note Mr. Meagher has stated the network has been built over many years, the 2006 MVA report stated clearly that it was inconsistent, as it was good in places but under-resourced in others.  Moreover, the Deloitte report stated the bus network had not been redesigned significantly for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">My simple message is that we must put a bomb under the network and reform it radically to meet the needs of Dubliners in 2009.  I am not convinced the existing bus network reflects people's needs in terms of where they live or wish to go.  Although significant changes are required, the company is hamstrung by the hand of history in implementing the changes that must happen.  Many services are provided because they have been in place for 50 to 100 years, rather than because they need to be provided in 2009.  I take Mr. Meagher's point which I have heard several times that when changes are made, the first protest comes from Oireachtas Members and councillors.  However, one must take such radical steps in order that more people will get out of their cars and use the bus and will perceive it as being a reliable, efficient and clear way to get from A to B and back again.  That is the message I wish to deliver to our guests.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I have five questions that I wish to put to Dublin Bus.  First, when will a decent city bus map be made available?  The map available is hard to acquire.  The last time I bought one in O'Connell Street, it cost €3 and was the size of a tent.  One would not carry it around and it is not easy to use.  Anecdotally, one is most likely to find out about the destination of a bus by asking someone at a bus stop on the streets of Dublin.  One neither goes to the web nor telephones a low-cost number.  One must ask others where a particular bus goes to or comes from.  The map on the Powerpoint presentation appears to be an improvement but still has a section on the centre of Dublin that is difficult to read.  Travellers in London may make use of a handy-sized map that one can carry around and on which the tube stations and bus routes are visible.  It is almost a matter of graphic design.  Improvements should be made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Second, a decent website would be highly desirable.  While it is getting there, it has been left up to the private sector to provide a web interface on which one can state one's location and intended destination.  I note the relevant section of the Powerpoint presentation suggests that on the Dublin Bus website one will be asked to search by place or route.  People seek a system that will provide them with the route between their location and intended destination.  That is what I wish to see.  The website on the Powerpoint presentation simply appears to have a different design from the existing site.  However, there is a private sector website, on which one places pointers on a Google map to enter one's exact location and one's intended destination.  This is what the travelling public wants in 2009.  Dublin Bus certainly should provide a service that matches the web interface the private sector has produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I have commented several times on my third bugbear, which is that travellers waiting at bus stops wish to know when the bus will depart and do not need to know when the bus may have left the terminus.  On a wet Friday morning, when one is at a bus stop without a shelter and trying to make out the number of an approaching bus, one does not wish to know when it may have left the terminus.  One wishes to know when it will leave one's stop.  I can get such information at bus stops in any city I have visited throughout Europe for the past 20 years.  This also should be the case in Dublin for those who travel by bus.  I have discussed real-time passenger information with Mr. Meagher previously.  It was promised 15 years ago in the Dublin Transportation Initiative's final report in 1994 and I am growing old waiting for it.  While I understand Dublin Bus must co-ordinate with the DTI, the DTO, private companies and everyone else, it is not rocket science.  Some computer programming is involved and a back office function required but Dublin Bus should be leading this process.  It should be making it happen, rather than waiting for everyone to come to an agreement on such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">My final issue pertains to the network.  The dead hand of history is evident in that the current Dublin Bus map is more a snail trail than a spider's web.  Basing one's bus network more on historical evidence than the current state of the city prevents one from attracting many more passengers to the bus service.  One needs a spider's web, in which one is not obliged, if one wishes to travel from Dún Laoghaire to Tallaght, to enter the city centre.  Either a direct route or a reliable transfer should be available to get to one's destination in a time that is not incomparable with travelling by car.  That is what will get people out of cars and make bus services more competitive in 2009.  While I acknowledge that Dublin Bus must work with all the other organisations involved, I simply wish to make a plea for it to move a little faster on such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Nationally, two measures are required.  Bus service priority is required which is as great an issue for Bus Éireann in places such as Limerick, given the rows between councillors on Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.  We must push ahead through such rows.  This also applies to Galway.  Bus Éireann needs to be given much higher priority on the approach roads to the M50.  It has a great service which it must be able to thread through traffic in the morning.  The bus gate in College Green must be provided.  There is no excuse in 2009 to have four lanes of car traffic thundering through College Green which should be a magical living room for the city.  It should have public transport services and taxis but there is no reason I should be able to drive through it in either direction whenever I so wish.  This is a political issue for Dublin City Council and Dublin Bus should be speaking even more loudly on such issues.  Moreover, this is an issue for members of all parties who should talk to their councillors and ensure bus services receive the priority they need.  I have no doubt Dublin Bus will get more people onto buses if one can leave Parnell Square and get to St. Stephen's Green in 15 minutes, rather than 45 minutes on some days and 15 minutes on others.  One requires certainty — that is what the travelling public wants.  Bus service priority is required and the bus companies should speak more loudly on the issue.  A network review is also required.  Dramatic changes must be made in this regard.  This message comes through repeatedly.  If one can take the Dublin Transportation Office modelling data and map them to the buses available to Dublin Bus, a much better match can be made.  My worry is that the bus companies, Dublin Bus in particular, are taking the easy option of making cutbacks.  I seek reform from the top down and the bottom up to produce a bus company which would better serve the city's needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I will try to be as brief as possible on the questions I had intended to ask.  Obviously, both companies have a responsibility to be efficient and cut costs in the current climate.  However, they also have a responsibility to respond to demand.  If staff are laid off or buses are sold, mothballed or scrapped, the capacity to deal with the changes in demand and demographics that will occur during the economy's upturn will be undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Since I have not heard anything, I do not know whether Mr. Meagher agrees that, in times of recession, be it officially a matter of months or the likely reality of one year, low paid workers will become more dependent on buses.  Given the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday, thousands of public servants will be forced to walk or cycle to work to make ends meet.  Perhaps forcing people to do that is the green sting in the pension levy.  However, when public servants and the rest of the public start juggling their finances in one or two months, they will try to save money.  Second-hand cars might be cheap, but they are expensive to run.  While the levy on parking spots may have been a good measure to introduce, the cost of running a car will be higher and more people will travel via bus.  Under the proposals outlined today, Dublin Bus will not be able to cater for such demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Will the working time directive, which Bus Átha Cliath must introduce, mean that further services will be cut?  The current cutbacks will reduce flexibility, substantial over-time and the number of drivers and buses necessary to cater for changes in demand and the changes imposed by the working time directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The company is proud of its joint first standing in terms of loading.  However, if it amalgamates routes and overloads buses instead of simply reaching a good standard, it will need additional buses.  From where will they and their drivers come?  Many of the buses serving routes on which there are additional demands will not be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Deloitte report mentions the Finglas route in particular.  Given that it is not my area, the route I will discuss is not in my constituency.  The report proposes to reduce by seven the number of peak-time buses.  If they are running at capacity, the proposal has no logic.  If a bus is running at capacity, it should be left alone irrespective of any consideration being given to amalgamating bus routes that do not run at capacity.  The same applies to the list of routes to be affected.  Quite a number of the buses in question run on routes that run either at or near their capacities.  If they are amalgamated, customers will be forced away.</p>

We received approval in 2006 and have been pushing the matter as hard as possible.  The first route will go on trial near the end of the year and we will launch our vehicle monitoring system at all depots in 2010.  This will provide information via mobile telephones and the Internet, but the provision of signs at bus stops will be a matter for Dublin City Council.  Regarding the network——</p>

          <p eId="para_277">Yes, it will deliver RTPI.  The Department is of the view that it should be an open platform and provided by an independent body.  Otherwise, we would have produced it.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The network review completed by MVA in 2006 took account of a range of data, including the journey time analyses conducted by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, and the quality bus network and the DTO model.  It set out a timeframe and a plan, the first section of which was to produce a business case for an additional 200 buses.  We have operated in line with the plan.  The development of an enhanced network of orbital services is one of its elements.  There will be a cost and a need for financial support, as would be the case anywhere else because orbital services tend to be peak-time services and have lighter loads at off-peak times.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The plan's first priority was to move the maximum number of people from cars to buses by developing high-frequency services on radial QBCs, identifying high priorities and placing buses in developing areas, for example, the 128 bus route.  We follow that recommendation to a T.  We have been basing our plans on DTO data.  Last year, we contacted the DTO for updated information.  The plans are not based on someone's whim.  I hope I have covered all the points raised.  If I have not, the Deputy should revert to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">For us, the main issue is how the recession has hit our business.  We have a responsibility to deal with this financial problem and we must implement cutbacks to put our financial house in order.  We are satisfied the revised frequencies will be adequate to cater for demand.  We will watch the situation closely, but there will not be any overloading.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">It is incumbent on us to implement the working time directive over a period of time, but it has more to do with staff working hours than services.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">Deputy O'Dowd has asked to make a concluding remark.  Before he does, I will make my own.  A number of years ago, the late Séamus Brennan gave the Stansted slot to Ryanair, which made Ryanair a success and Aer Lingus an even greater success.  I will put the same point to the unions.  Some years ago, Mr. Richard Branson put 900 trains on UK railways.  When I checked with a counterpart this morning, I was told that Mr. Branson has a successful rail network.  Does the delegation accept, as Deputy Cuffe noted, that we are not getting the required reforms; there are cutbacks rather than reform?  The general public would welcome an opportunity for somebody like Mr. Michael O'Leary to take over, for example, the Blanchardstown or Finglas radial route into the city.  Does the delegation accept that the public will not continue to accept the lack of reform?</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I may go to Dawson Street and take a ticket for the No. 92, but because it does not come too often, I would take whatever bus brings me to O'Connell Bridge and I must buy another ticket there to bring me to Heuston.  In this day and age, how can we expect people to want to take Dublin Bus when it has not made the most fundamental reforms?</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I will put this to the unions.  It is time for the management of Dublin Bus and its unions to get their act together and provide an efficient commuter service to those wishing to get in and out of the city.  My belief is if it does not start to happen fairly soon, there will be a demand for the private sector to be given some of those routes.  I am an avid supporter of Dublin Bus, with the drivers being the best ambassadors in the city.  If it is not going to change and the company does not get its act together, I do not see any option but for the private sector to be given some of those routes to see if it can do any better.</p>

          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_287">In terms of ticket availability, a range of tickets has been built up to suit the customer.  We have made many changes in Dublin Bus over the years.  It is not by accident, as an urban bus operator, that we have one of the lowest public service obligation payments and one of the highest loadings per bus.  Our buses have been well used and run efficiently.  Reading through the Deloitte report, that is what it states.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">If we are to be criticised in any way, it is because we have tried to provide the most comprehensive service into all the nooks and crannies of Dublin over the years.  The Deloitte report has indicated services should be streamlined, and we will go ahead and do this.  Everybody wants their own bus service into their own little area, which is the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">We have worked very hard to modernise the service.  We have an excellent fleet and drivers.  The fleet is of a high standard and highly maintained.  We are moving forward on all the elements.  We would have liked to have had automatic real time passenger information sooner but there are issues outside our control with regard to the integrated ticketing system.  We are very much progressed on the smart card and we have our own version.  All of our buses have been fitted for smart cards.  We are moving forward on all these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Our network and all the proposals we have put forward over the years have been based on solid analysis, with independent experts helping out.  Anything done by this company is benchmarked well against international operators and companies of our size.  Many of the operators in the UK and elsewhere relate to services provided by private operators.  We benchmark with lower subvention, higher loadings and generally lower fares.  We must deal with a congestion problem that is more difficult than in most cities.  On balance, there is much good performance by Dublin Bus.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_291">The summary of the Finglas case is very clear.  It indicates there are some very lightly loaded services coming from Finglas, although there are some very heavily loaded examples as well.  One of the key issues is the bunching of buses together.  Nobody is losing a bus in that case but the bus is running and nobody is on it.  That is a question of organisation.  It is not that Maggie Murphy cannot get a bus but that nobody is getting on a bus that is running.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The other part of the argument I put forward earlier is that Fianna Fáil, as part of Government in 2000, wanted to open the bus market to competition in Dublin but nothing has happened.  I do not blame Dublin Bus for everything.  The Government has failed to act and insist on choice.  Deputy Cuffe made the fair point of putting consumers at the centre of the issue and getting people on buses.  There are far more private buses nationally than are owned by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  These are not being used at all and it seems the policy, as I outlined earlier, is to put them out of business when they have an operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The following comment relates to Bus Éireann.  Matthews Coaches operates in its area of operation in an efficient and effective manner.  It provides new routes for people living in newly developed areas, without a subvention from the State.  It is putting Iarnród Éireann under pressure because it is taking on customers who would normally travel on the train.  If there is dynamic leadership in private or public enterprise, it will change the picture when it is consumer-led.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I hope the answer to the next question is a definite "No".  It has been said to me — it is a rumour — that there may be new buses purchased by either Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann which have never been used and are sitting in garages somewhere.  Is that the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_296">Despite school transport levels increasing by 2% or 3% last year, it was stated that it would increase this year.  Is that the responsibility of Dublin Bus or the Department?  What increases are proposed and when will it come about?</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_297">I do not deny that some of the issues raised by Deputy Cuffe on information are very important.  In 1991, when we both joined Dublin City Council, we were being promised real time information at every bus stop.  Some 18 years later, we still do not have it.  In London, although the locals seemed to understand the bus network, students or visitors such as myself never seemed to be able to understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The fundamental points made by the chief executive of Dublin Bus are profound with regard to support from Government for a good public transport network.  Such a network does not come cheap and must be worked at.  In the run up to the 2007 election, the Labour Party put forward an opposing view in that we asked the company to dramatically expand and greatly reduce fares.  We were looking at such a reduced fare as a €1 basic fare, which would be the driver of getting people out of cars.  We knew that would mean a higher PSO.  Could this be done?</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The ideal would be a free bus system or being able to hop on and off buses as we wanted all over this city.  Visitors from Galway or elsewhere could hop on a few buses and head up to Heuston.  That would be the ideal system and would surely bring about a dramatic change in the amount of people coming through the canal cordon in the morning in cars.  Could that be done with the policies and attitude of this Government, with the Greens an essential cog in keeping the operation in existence?</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The Chairman spoke of threatening the company and workers sitting behind us.  The late Séamus Brennan wanted to threaten the company with giving a quadrant of the city to private operators but at the end of the day this will amount to greatly reduced conditions for drivers and workers.  People will come in and do a few hours in the morning peak before hanging around for hours and then going back on again.  We had Ryanair representatives and the man himself before us and we know how he operates.  There is no doubt that the Ryanair model could be used in road transport, and we know private operators who use it.  Ultimately, it is not good for either workers or commuters.</p>

          <from>Mr. Joe Meagher</from>
          <p eId="para_301">With regard to bunching, we have a very high frequency service on a number of corridors.  At peak it is every minute in Blanchardstown, every 1.3 minutes in Tallaght, every 1.1 minute in Stillorgan, every minute in Malahide and every 1.2 minutes in Lucan.  In this situation buses will come together.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">No new buses are idle.  The most important point I want to make concerns contractors.  Dublin Bus employs 22 contractors on school services.  It was mentioned that Dublin Bus has a policy to run off people.  This is absolutely wrong.  A legal issue is raised so I am constrained in what I say but I want to make it absolutely clear that Dublin Bus did not take any action to cause any operator to go off the road.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">That is not the point I made.  I do not want to stray into a legal area.  My point is that the assistant secretary of the Department of Transport wrote a letter to Dublin Bus stating he believed it was abusing its dominant position in the marketplace with regard to the operation of private buses with a licence in Dublin.</p>

          <from>Mr. Tim Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_305">Mention was made of real time information and we are trialing this at present.  It is available to a limited number of people on the web and on mobile telephones.  When one goes to a stop one can get information on when the next bus will arrive on one's mobile.  We also have a screen in Busáras which shows arrival times.  We will roll out this service in the near future.  This is the first time we have had nationwide real time information for a bus operator and it is quite a challenge for us because it requires nationwide coverage.  With regard to timetables, the Deloitte report mentions that we have a good network with clockface timetables as far as possible.  I can discuss this later if anybody wishes to speak with me about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Services in Balbriggan were mentioned.  We run a 20 minute high frequency service from Balbriggan to Dublin throughout the day.  The service is affected because it is on the old road but we still maintain a 20 minute service.  Our service competitor operates on the motorway and there is a tendency for people to go along the motorway.  This affects the frequency one can maintain in places such as Balbriggan.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">As I pointed out, our network has changed considerably.  Some services have been curtailed and others have been developed.  We have introduced orbital services and tested markets such as these over the years.  Some have succeeded and some have not.  I agree with the bus priority measures and I thank committee members for their support on this, particularly in places such as Limerick where we introduced a high-frequency service and if we had bus lanes it would be more attractive.  In fairness to the Chairman he understands what happened in Doughiska.  We received much support in Galway and introduced a bus lane and high-frequency service.  We were extremely pleased and it was one of the most successful services we introduced and the numbers increased rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">A query was raised about bus shelters.  The investment in bus shelters is approximately €4 million but this will be covered by advertising sales.  New bus shelters will provide better facilities such as customer information because they will have a display.  It will not be a long-term financial burden on the company.  We may invest some money in the short term but it will come back to us.</p>

We identify the locations.  Obviously, sufficient demand must exist and advertising space must be sold.  Adshel funds the shelters and, more important, it covers any liabilities and maintenance.  Our experience at putting up our own shelters with local authorities, which I did many years ago, was that it did not work out very well.  This has worked very effectively and it has funded shelters throughout the country.  If people want to place a bus shelter on Patrick's Street, Eyre Square or a city centre we state that a bus shelter must also be placed at the edge of the city or in a rural area such as Gort.

          <from>Mr. Michael Faherty</from>
          <p eId="para_326">I thank the committee for inviting us to appear before it.  I intend to outline several points we believe to be relevant in regard to the outrageous decision to withdraw 270 buses from Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.  Despite what was said in the previous presentation, we are convinced this decision is driven solely by economic considerations.  The decision to withdraw buses was based on subvention issues and has nothing to do with customers or the travelling public.  Responsibility for the provision of services ultimately lies at the door of the Minister for Transport, the Government and the companies' management.  At the same time, however, we have strong views on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Only six months ago, this committee published a useful report which found that the full utilisation of the existing fleet of 1,182 buses during off-peak hours and the deployment of 350 additional buses within the next two years were critical requirements.  Bus Átha Cliath management supported that finding at the time, despite what its representatives have said today.  The Deloitte report published two weeks ago, stated that a significant expansion of the bus fleet and increased priority for buses are parts of the national development plan.  Its analysis indicated that the fleet as it stands is just adequate to service current demand and favoured optimising the existing network and extracting full value from the fleet before considering fleet expansion.  Today, however, we are discussing a reduction by 10% of the existing fleet.  The Deloitte report also stated that the traffic management plan for Transport 21 and city centre metro and Luas construction may require a significant increase in the modal share of bus.  We discussed that issue during our last appearance before the committee.  Bus Átha Cliath itself reckons that a minimum of 42 additional buses will be required to augment existing services due to the massive disruptions which will inevitably result from the construction of the new Luas and metro lines, particularly in the vicinity of College Green.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Regrettably, the Minister contends that the withdrawal of 120 buses will have no adverse impact on peak services.  Publicly, management has supported that contention.  These utterances are clearly designed to insulate the Minister and management from the backlash which will surely follow the withdrawal of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">By withdrawing 120 buses, Bus Átha Cliath will revert to the fleet size of ten years ago.  Bearing in mind that the workforce in this city has substantially increased since then and that parking facilities are severely curtailed, major congestion will ensue.  It is insane for anybody to speak about reducing these public services.  The Deloitte report predicts that buses will be the main provider of public transport for the immediate future.  We want to know what happened to the policy of encouraging people to leave their cars at home and take public transport.  This committee recommended a 30% increase in the number of buses on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Bus Átha Cliath claims that the fall-off in passenger numbers is only 6% or 7%.  We argue that a reduction of 10% in the fleet is not warranted by that decrease in passengers.  It will have a devastating effect on the public in the Dublin area.  Bus Éireann's plans to curtail services across the network will affect 150 buses and result in a loss of 325 jobs across all grades.  The Deloitte report stated that Bus Éireann operates a public service obligation fleet of 450 buses on a variety of rural, suburban and town routes.  Since the rest of the fleet provides services on commercial routes, I assume the 150 buses they intend to withdraw are from the 450 that provide the PSO services.  That is one third of that fleet withdrawn.  Despite what Mr. Tim Hayes said, having done that, how would it be possible to maintain the current integrated network with only two thirds of the buses?  Anybody who knows rural Ireland knows that cannot happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We are pleading with all members of the committee to ascertain from the Minister and Bus Éireann management a comprehensive list of the services they propose to withdraw from 1 March.  Earlier today the Chairman asked that question.  He wanted to know the list of routes.  We do not know where they are.  Once that list is published there will be a backlash from every public representative in rural Ireland.  Bearing in mind that the majority of this distinguished committee represent rural constituencies, they do not need me to remind them of the devastating effect this socially retrograde development will have on the most disadvantaged in our society.  The people hit will be the unemployed, the elderly and the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I will touch on staff issues without going too deeply into them.  We wrote to both companies advising them that the proposed sacking of 270 probation drivers will be opposed.  I take issue with Mr. Meagher, who, unfortunately, has left, because he described those people as "temporary drivers".  There was never anything temporary about these people.  They are on the probationary period, recruited into full-time positions.  The only way they would have left would have been of their own free will or if the probationary period was not satisfactory.  He has referred to them as temporary workers in the media before.  There is no such thing as temporary drivers in Bus Átha Cliath.  These drivers were recruited into the company with a guarantee of a secure and permanent job.  Once their probationary period was deemed satisfactory, they had the job for life if they wished to stay in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">A voluntary severance package has always happened in all three companies, and if a staff surplus arises as a result of any change to the network, this should be offered to the people who want to leave voluntarily.  That has always happened.  I am in the job 42 years and I have never seen the like of this.  It never happened before.  We are not saying the company must carry a surplus of staff or that some buses might be taken out of the network.  We are saying if that happens, the only way to deal with it is through a voluntary severance package, as has happened at the three CIE companies for the 42 years I have been around.  We had to inform management we will not engage in any negotiations on those cost recovery plans because we cannot do so until this issue is resolved.  I do not like saying it but that is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The Minister for Transport identified an interesting link between the company's plans and the Deloitte report.  He said: "This report identifies the challenge facing both companies in developing and implementing the recovery costs."  He further stated that any actions taken by Dublin Bus to deal with the difficulties should be informed by the Deloitte report and "its vision of a totally reshaped network".  He seems to be saying the financial problems it has should be addressed in the context of a review of the network.  As a result of that we wrote to the Minister seeking a meeting to discuss our problems and those he sees through the Deloitte report.  We received an acknowledgement and hope that meeting will take place as soon as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. Andrew McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_335">I was listening earlier when the Chairman referred to Mr. Michael O'Leary.  The union I represent and for which I work was formed 100 years ago — we celebrate our centenary this year — to fight and oppose the type of tyranny people such as Mr. O'Leary bring to workers in this country.  It would be unacceptable to us if the Chairman, the committee or the Government introduced a type of tyranny to bus workers with no security of employment or guarantee of wages, sometimes not even knowing who their employer is, but carrying out a service to the public in the name of the State and public transport.  Far be it from me to criticise somebody who is deceased and is not here to defend himself, but certain conditions should have been applied to the granting of Stansted to Ryanair and the undermining of Aer Lingus at the time.  Some guarantee should have been put in place to maintain decent standards for workers employed in Aer Lingus at the time.  Privatisation does not hold all the fears for us provided there are decent wages and conditions for workers and security of employment.  That is a basic human right to which any worker is entitled, any day of the week and at any time, regardless of the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">If bus transport is to be the principal provider of passenger transport throughout Ireland, how can Bus Éireann justify cutbacks?  If it is to be a significant player in ensuring links between communities, how can it cut one third of its fleet?  According to the Deloitte report, Bus Éireann has 700 large public transport buses.  That is only a fraction of the number of large public transport buses in this country.  According to the Deloitte report, Bus Éireann carried 50.2 million passengers in 2007, or 95.7 million when school numbers are included.  As everybody on the committee knows, a very substantial part of the school transport is contracted out.  The majority of schoolchildren in this country are transported by contractors.  Bus Éireann grew its passenger numbers by 15% between 2001 and 2007.  I sometimes wonder if that is because of good management or despite the management.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">We are aware of scenarios, for example, on a Sunday evening where many third level students are returning to their colleges.  If one leaves Tralee or Killarney to go to Limerick, one is dropped at the station in Limerick.  The bus does not continue out to University of Limerick or the Limerick Institute of Technology.  That is a glaring example of an unfriendly corporate decision towards a travelling public.  I am not talking about having to get two tickets to go from here to Heuston Station with Bus Éireann.  I am talking about a simple situation where one has a loading of perhaps 80% or 90% on a bus, one drops them outside the station in Limerick and they have to find their own way out to the accommodation in UL.  That is a nice journey on a wet evening, particularly at this time of year.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">In 2007 Bus Éireann received only €36.6 million under the public service obligation, equating to 12% of total revenue.  This can be compared to Connexxion in the Netherlands which received a subsidy as a percentage of revenue of 49%, Can Postal-Post Auto in Switzerland which received 51%, and TEC in the Walloon region in Belgium which received 78%, according to the Deloitte report.  This is compared with 12% in Ireland and we are talking about cutbacks.  The Government has a responsibility here.  The Deloitte report has found Bus Éireann to be as efficient as its peers.  It goes on to say it will not be possible to make major cost savings on bus networks without reducing services.  It also says it will be important to ensure the integrated nature of the network is maintained as far as is practicable.  How can an integrated service be maintained with such severe cutbacks?  Who is the miracle worker in Bus Éireann who will find the solution?  Speaking to drivers and other staff grades, they cannot see it.  If this report is to form the basis of what will happen, how can cuts be carried out while maintaining an integrated service?</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The report also states that overall wage and engineering costs are in line with peers in the UK.  The Chairman was eulogising about Mr. Branson and the trains.  There are large regions in the UK with private sector transport buses yet we have costs and efficiencies on a par with it.  Surely we should try to maintain that.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The report found the scheduling of buses and drivers to be efficient when the nature of each service was taken into account.  It highlights that the scope for significant cost savings in Bus Éireann is limited and warns that the company should be very careful.  Again, this relates to the integrated network.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">In view of the report's recommendation I find it very difficult to see how Bus Éireann management can justify a proposal to reduce its staff numbers by 322 and fleet by a total of 150.  There is a question continuously going through my head; the buses are approximately a maximum of five or six years old, so what will happen to them?  Somebody referred to e-voting machines earlier so will there be 150 Bus Éireann buses mothballed in garages and stored until an expected upturn in the economy?  I cannot see that as a practical runner, as it would tie up significant capital.  It would be a significant waste of resources funded, in a large part, by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">There is no doubt in our mind that if the company continues along its proposed path, severe hardship will be placed on communities which have no other access to public transport.  The company should be endeavouring to develop services that will be of real benefit to towns, villages and communities which will not otherwise benefit from public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Along those lines, there is opportunity for the company in these times.  In recent weeks, the drivers have noticed an increase in numbers on certain services.  The drivers went to the trouble of inquiring about the increased numbers.  As a result of the economic times we are in, many families have had to get rid of the second car and people have had to begin using public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">This is happening throughout the country, so it is a very dangerous time for Bus Éireann to be thinking of pulling services, not only from rural communities but cities around the country.  Dublin has its commuter belt but so have Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford.  It is vital that consideration be given to that, although I am not sure how the mechanism can be found between this committee, the Department of Transport and the company.  I am nevertheless convinced that a way should be found to deal with this issue.  At a time of growing unemployment in our communities, it is vital that Bus Éireann provides transport to places of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">There can sometimes be a disconnect with regard to timetabling.  For example, one may see buses arriving at the centre of a town at 8 a.m., where people could use them to get to work if they were in at 7.30 a.m. or 7.45 a.m. because the start time may be 8 a.m.  Workers could avail of the services to travel to work and there could be a corresponding scenario at the other end of the day to allow people travel home after work.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I was fascinated by one of the Deputies earlier speaking about Dublin Bus being able to use the Dublin Port tunnel in the morning but not in the evening.  That must be an Irish joke.  Deputy Michael Kennedy made the comment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Andrew McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_348">Close examination of shift-work patterns in various places of employment could be important.  Where there is a large place of employment, there can be a shift from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. or 4 p.m. to 12 a.m.  The company must respond to that with regard to where people can be collected and brought to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Another factor which should be taken into account is that clear evidence is emerging that financial institutions are increasingly reluctant to grant loans for motor vehicles, and this could lead to an increased demand for public transport, despite predictions to the contrary by the company.  It was mentioned in the Dáil not too long ago that there is clear evidence that some of the financial institutions are shortening the time over which they will give loans and will not grant loans, particularly for second-hand cars.  They might give a loan for a new car if the criteria are justified but with a young person who has got a job and who wants to buy a second car, there is clear evidence emerging that financial institutions will not give loans.  Public transport may be needed to keep what is left in our economy alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">This may not be about generating some kind of recovery as we are gone from the days when a financial institution would give a 100% loan for a house and the people would ask what the customer was driving.  If it was older than two years they would give a loan for a new car, and if the customer's partner's car was older than two years they would give another loan for that.  A customer seeking a loan for €200,000 may have come out with a loan for €280,000.  We are well past that time.  This will have an impact and it is the wrong time for any contemplation on the part of the Bus Éireann of reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We must also remember that there has been a significant downward shift in fuel prices in recent times.  According to the Deloitte report, there may have been hedging but fuel prices have come down in the past couple of months.  Instead of reducing its fleet, Bus Éireann should concentrate on growing business and protecting existing revenue stream and employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">Aer Lingus would have gone the way of KLM, Sabena and Swissair had it not been for the competition provided by Ryanair.  The reality is we now have a fine airline in Aer Lingus as a result of that competition.  Whether we like it or not, the public knows a flight can be bought with Aer Lingus or Ryanair to many locations in Britain for the same price as getting the bus to the airport.  The Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann management and unions must bring about reforms so an efficient bus service can be provided in this country.  That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I agree with the comments made by the unions.  The proper response is not just to implement cutbacks, although the two companies must remain solvent.  The proper response is to bring about reforms so that commuters, especially in this city, can get an efficient bus service.  If they are not going to get it from Dublin Bus, they will demand it from somebody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I am not in favour of privatisation.  It is a serious disappointment to us — me personally and the members of this committee — that after the report we produced to which Mr. Faherty referred, we are now going backwards.  We sought expansion, greater efficiencies and the ability of buses to move freely in this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I wish to make two points.  Is it possible that instead of these lay-offs there could be flexibility so that agreement can be reached between the union and management to maintain some of these services at lower cost during this period of economic difficulty?  This would encourage more people to use buses, which is the issue we raised with management.  What pressures can the unions apply — it did not provide much of a response to our report in this regard — on the need for bus gates in the city centre, for example, so that buses can run freely?  Every time I get on a bus and ask the driver about his problems he says he cannot drive his bus because of congestion.  What voice have the two unions added to the efforts we have made in this committee to free up the pinch points around the city and the Dublin city centre area in order to make buses run more freely and thereby increase the number of passengers using them?  I believe that is the way to solve the problem we have.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">It is important to recognise the commitment of the bus drivers and employees of Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus to their company and the lifetime of service they give.  I acknowledge and agree with many of the points made, particularly with regard to planning for the future.  Buses should not be tied up in a garage somewhere.  Patterns do change.  People are not going to work at 7 a.m.  There are more people at home who will travel during what were previously off-peak periods.  Obviously, dynamic interaction between the company and the unions will make a significant difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">There are two references in the report to the issue of out-of-service driving.  We are talking about a saving of something like €2 million on the Finglas route.  This is not a reflection on the rights of workers to have their breaks and to be free according to regulations.  The issue is that if the bus is being driven, rather than the driver being driven, this means that 20% of bus time is used to carry the driver to wherever he is having his break.  The point made in the report is that in the United Kingdom, at various garages, the out-of-service mileage is typically between 3% and 10%, while on average on the Finglas route it is 20%.  I am not being critical and I fully accept the right of any worker to have his break.  That is sacrosanct.  Would it be possible for the union, with Dublin Bus, to address these issues?  We need to be practical about this.  For example, drivers could be brought to places in a different type of vehicle.  This would make a lot more sense and would be much less expensive.  I will not be able to hear the answer as I have to leave, but I will pick it up afterwards.  The meeting I must go to is at 6 p.m. in another building.  I apologise for that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_369">Unfortunately, I am in the same boat as the Committee of Public Accounts has been meeting since 5.30 p.m.  It is a very small committee of which I am a member, so I will have to go to the meeting.  I warmly welcome Mr. Faherty and his colleagues from the NBRU and Mr. McCarthy and his colleagues from SIPTU.  How much information do they have about the cutbacks in routes?  In the case of Dublin Bus, I gave a list of routes that are being cut, as we are hearing from our constituents who are drivers: for example, the Tallaght routes — the 77 and 77A — the Clondalkin routes, the 13 and 13A, the 7, the 8 and the 11.  Mr. Meagher said it would only be a couple of minutes more between buses and would not have much of an impact on anybody, but we are fearful for the workers and commuters who are coming in each day.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">In addition, I ask Mr. McCarthy whether he knows what the situation is with Bus Éireann.  The CEO of Bus Éireann has always made the point — he made it powerfully to this committee — that the most important thing Bus Éireann has is its network.  As it faithfully serves so many districts and parishes of this whole island, that is its <i>raison d’être</i>, and he wants to fight to preserve that network at all costs.  Will the network be seriously damaged?</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The possibility of job losses is a sword hanging over many young men, many of whom have contacted us and are very upset.  One chap is to finish his year on the 25th of this month, and the axe is hovering over his head in his garage.  He is very upset.  He gave up a job in the public service, in which he was stuck in a particular role and could not get promotion, because he wanted to advance himself.  He went into driving and is doing very well.  He is an excellent worker and an excellent driver, but he is now faced with this horrendous situation.  Will both unions now be insisting, as Mr. Faherty made clear, that staff efficiency measures will have to be on the traditional voluntary basis and that we cannot attack vulnerable younger workers in this manner, particularly men and women who are on the verge of finishing their year's training?  They are full-time drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">My colleagues made points about Euro-buses and so on.  Do the unions have any basic opposition to the kind of improvements mentioned earlier, such as real-time information and smaller buses ferrying workers to particular points where they are needed?  Deputy Cuffe mentioned this earlier.  As the witnesses know, the Dáil is today discussing the incredible plan launched by the Taoiseach yesterday which means that everyone in this building, starting with ourselves, and all our workers and colleagues throughout this building and related buildings, will have their pay dramatically slashed, including very low paid workers.  I commend the two trade unions for not going along with this — for walking out the other day and saying they would not put up with it.  There are other ways to do this.  We could have a progressive taxation system, as Jack O'Connor and his colleagues at SIPTU vehemently argued.  Most other countries have such a system, but it was deliberately dismantled in this country 30 years ago.</p>

I do not think they would, but that is more or less what is happening in the public service.  These are momentous days.  The bulk of public service workers will not accept these measures and there will be serious repercussions in the months ahead.  There is no question about that.  What is happening in the two national bus companies is a pointer in this direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">The issue of competitors is a difficult one for us.  According to Deloitte, 8,500 large public service vehicles were registered in the private sector in 2007.  Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus between them have only 1,900.  Anybody who knows Bus Éireann and the country in general will know that there are private operators working for Bus Éireann and on some of the routes operated by Bus Éireann on a daily basis.  This is something that has been going on for years.  The contention that private and public do not operate in the same areas is not true.  It is all over the country.  If the question is about Dublin Bus, it is a different matter.  The Chairman is familiar with the various plans that were produced.  The former Minister for Transport, the late Deputy Séamus Brennan, Lord have mercy on him, produced a plan around 2002.  Several proposals and ideas were put on the table, although we never finalised them.  However, outside Dublin, competitors are working alongside Bus Éireann every day, and, in some cases, working for it.  If I remember correctly, the Dublin Bus annual report from two or three years ago stated that approximately €20 million was paid to private operators who were under contract.  That is an ongoing thing.  Nobody has put anything to us about reform recently.  The most recent reform of Bus Átha Cliath took place when the total network was reviewed 15 years ago.  At the time there was full co-operation and the entire network was restructured.  That was the last time there was major change to the network.  Deloitte seems to suggest that should happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I do not know if there are alternatives to the present plan.  We cannot even get off the starting blocks to start negotiations within the company because of the sacking of 270 probationary drivers.  Until that matter is resolved, we will not be able to explore other ideas people might have.  I am at pains to point out that this issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">It is clear to those of us who know Bus Éireann that of the 450 buses used to provide public service obligation services, 150 have been taken away.  It had a very efficient and integrated service, as Deloitte commented, but that will not happen in the new environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">We were given a long list of duties, as we call them, on the job, that would be discontinued but we do not know precisely what impact this will have on any area.  When these duties are taken from the system, new structures will be required.  It is not possible to take three or four buses off a route.  The service has to be rescheduled with new rosters and a new system.  It will take some time to do this and until then we do not know how it will affect any area.  We have no information on Bus Éireann, apart from that on the removal of 150 buses from the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">We cannot get away from the issue of probationary drivers and it must be addressed.  It is hard for a trade unionist to watch people lose their jobs every day and we all feel for them but management has decided, for whatever reason, to draw a line through the names of over 300 drivers and terminate their employment.  That would not have happened in the 1940s and 1950s.  In a republic we cannot allow this to happen.  Management will have to come up with a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The provision of real-time information is a matter for management, one about which Mr. Meagher spoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Deloitte is a professional organisation and picked an area that was easy for it to examine, Finglas, from where there was only one corridor to town.  I worked on the buses to Finglas 40 years ago when a number of routes served the area — the 40, 40A, 40B and 35.  Today there are one or two extra routes.  Buses on one main corridor serve Finglas village but it is a massive area which in recent years has extended in every direction.  Our understanding is that Deloitte recommends providing feeder services to the various parts of Finglas to bring people into the village, dump them there where they can board another bus to the city centre and do the same in the opposite direction.  In theory, that sounds great but Bus Átha Cliath has done a very poor job in explaining what it did in the past.  It tried the same system in Tallaght, another massive area, where it introduced feeder services which it had to discontinue because nobody used them.  People are not prepared to get onto a minibus or feeder bus, get off in the village in the rain and wait for another bus to come and do the same in the opposite direction.  Politicians in all these areas — county councillors — made representations to ensure it did not happen because their constituents did not want it.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It is easy for Deloitte to produce a report and state this system would result in a saving of €2.1 million.  How did it arrive at this sum?  It adds that the system could be replicated on nine or ten other corridors but Bus Átha Cliath will not be allowed to put it into practice.  That is not to say the network does not need to be reviewed, restructured and modernised.  That is possibly required but what Deloitte has put forward will not work in practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">That is a good question.  The service to Finglas is good.  Deloitte referred to this.  I do not know why Bus Átha Cliath is not carrying more passengers there.  The problem may be the fare structure.  I do not know the answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">Neither does management. It gave us material indicating it had the highest ratio and so on, which I do not accept.  Dublin Bus should be able to increase the number of passengers.  Its buses are driving into and out of the city centre; that is why it takes an hour or an hour and a half to get out of the city.  The challenge for the unions and management is to get people out of their cars and onto buses.  We can do this and have an efficient and profitable bus service.  That is why, having heard the union representatives, management and everybody else, we recommended the provision of extra buses at peak times.  To be fair to the unions, they went along with the idea of the direct award subcontract to introduce extra buses at peak times.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">From my study of the subject in the past 18 months I believe it is possible to bring about change.  The total number of passengers has dropped significantly — 148 million — but it is possible to bring it up to 200 million by achieving such change and particularly getting buses to move.</p>

          <from>Mr. Willie O’Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_390">I thank the Chairman.  I do not want to repeat what my colleagues have said, rather I will concentrate on Dublin Bus and answer Deputy Broughan.  The first thing that stands out from the Deloitte report is that it states Dublin Bus has enough buses in its fleet to meet demand but that it will not if it removes 120 buses.  It beggars belief people think Dublin Bus and its workers can increase the numbers travelling on bus services with a reduction of 120 buses and 230 staff.  That is pie in the sky theoretics.  One cannot increase the numbers travelling on buses when one removes 120 buses from the fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I support the Deputy who spoke about letting the Government off the hook.  The decision on the fuel rebate took €12 million from the coffers of Dublin Bus.  The company does not have the capacity to withstand such a financial hit.  The unions cannot deal with such an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I refer to the other cuts sought by Dublin Bus.  In some respects they all seem to be linked to the Deloitte report.  I allude to Deputy Broughan's question.  The trade unions can deal with some of these cuts, such as the amount of money that would be saved by a pay pause.  We can deal with those issues and there was provision for that in the 2016 agreement.  We can deal with every issue in the Deloitte report.  That must be put on record.  As a trade union involved in Dublin Bus, SIPTU is not running away from any recommendations in the report.  We question the validity of some of the proposals.  For example, I question how Deloitte can put forward proposals relating to the Finglas route.  The report states more than €2 million in efficiency savings could be generated.  However, earlier Dublin Bus management stated that it tried to do this already and it failed.  The management of Dublin Bus stated today that it could introduce these efficiencies and that it believed the proposal could work.  The same management states out of the other side of its mouth that it has tried to do this already and it has failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I refer to a particular matter which is a main element of the Deloitte report.  The report advocates a strong main corridor for buses and certain elements feed into that.  The unions, the management and the workers of Dublin Bus management have stated they will implement this if it is what people want.  It makes absolutely no difference to our members.  If that is what people seek, that is what we will do.  Every politician in Dublin city will be in contact with their leaders, Dublin Bus, the political parties and other public representatives making the case that they do not wish to see the implementation of this proposal.  This is what SIPTU expects.  We are aware of the position.  We are going through the process of explaining to the public exactly what these cuts will mean.  It is one thing to say to a member of the travelling public that two buses will be taken off a certain route.  However, it is a different matter to explain that one was waiting for half an hour or three quarters of an hour for a bus rather than the two minute wait suggested by the media.  That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Many of the 120 buses to be withdrawn are termed universal buses.  They are in use during peak demand and extra buses are put on certain routes.  If these universal buses are withdrawn from these routes, people will be waiting at the bus stops.  Earlier I heard a comment from a Deputy to the effect that central to the Deloitte report was that it would be led by the requirements of the passengers.  The report should be led by these rather than by economics.  That is the purpose of public services.  However, it appears that economics will drive this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">A Fine Gael Deputy advocated competition, and stated there is no choice, but that there should be choice in the market.  The case is made that there should be competition for providers, but passengers will have no choice in Finglas.  They will be told the service will be provided in a certain way and they can like it or leave it.  The services provided so far by Dublin Bus and its workers have provided a choice for passengers.  There is variation in where people may travel, where they stop and how they travel to the city centre.  Passengers do not wish to get two buses or change buses when travelling into town from Finglas.  Perhaps Deloitte believes this is what the people of Finglas seek.  However, I believe when the people in Finglas are told they will need two buses to get into town, they will tell their public representatives something different.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The report criticised the complexity of the bus schedules.  They are complex because of the services people seek.  There is also an absence of a land use policy.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Mr. Willie O’Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_398">The complexity of the bus schedules is criticised in the report.  The point made by SIPTU is that they are complex because that is what is demanded by public representatives and the public.  They seek a service at certain times and the complexity is largely driven by this.  If we ensure there are strong routes or lanes into the city centre, that will not find favour with the travelling public.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">There is criticism of the land use policy, which has been driven by different Departments throughout the years.  It has allowed low density housing to develop which results in complex bus scheduling.  The Deloitte report advocated cutting certain legs.  These legs were not included in routes for the personal satisfaction of drivers.  They were included to provide a service to people in those areas and to bring them into the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Some buses may not have a full load.  They may not even be half full, but they provide a service.  I refer to the analogy used earlier concerning Ryanair.  It will cancel a route if it does not have an 80% load.  If we are told there cannot be a service unless a bus is at least 80% full, we will tell the general public as much.  This raises a question concerning the public service obligation.  Buses will have a peak load at certain times of the day.  That is not the case for 75% of the time during which buses operate.  If a bus is not achieving a certain load and buses are not making money at certain times of the day and services are cancelled as a result, I believe public representatives will hear about it from constituents.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">It is because of the complexity of the travelling public, there are nuances everywhere.  A question was put concerning the reasons people park cars.  An issue largely forgotten in this discussion is the matter of congestion.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_403">Can Mr. O'Donohoe answer my question?  If the Luas is travelling at 11 a.m., 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. in the afternoon, there are many passengers on board.  One sees very few buses and passengers on buses at these times.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Mr. Willie O’Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_404">The Luas has no obstructions on its journey.  A bus must deal with congestion a good deal of the time.  That is the reason some people travel by car.  Such people say if they travel by bus, it may or may not be there and that one cannot be 100% accurate about when exactly it will arrive at the end of the journey.  Some people will travel by car, because they believe they cannot rely on the bus.  To a large extent, congestion is responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The committee should note that all the evidence throughout the years has shown that if one schedules buses frequently and they arrive on time, people will use them.  We are now going the opposite direction.  There are plans to reduce the frequency and the number of buses.  However, there is an expectation to overturn the evidence of the past 200 years.  There is a belief that this will increase the number of people travelling on buses.  It is a nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I wish to refer to some other points.  My colleagues in the NBRU referred to the plans going forward.  Such plans have been put to workers in Dublin Bus.  To answer Deputy Broughan's points, SIPTU will not be found wanting in terms of the flexibility required.  We have never been found wanting in the past and we will not be found wanting this time.  I refer to out-of-time driving.  If that is an issue and if it becomes a cost, we will not be found wanting at the table when it is put in front of us.  I refer to the routes and the cutbacks.  We intend to go to each of the garages and, in layman's terms, write out the implications of these cuts for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Our members know the travelling public does not really care if 200, 300 or 400 people lose their jobs in CIE, because they have other problems.  However, they will care when they are told routes will be withdrawn and they will not be able to go where they wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I refer to voluntary severances in Dublin Bus.  It should be put on record that, at present, SIPTU is the only union representing all categories in Dublin Bus.  I have on occasion met management and they have told us that under no circumstances will voluntary severance be available to drivers as there is no money available.  I could walk out one door and walk in another and the same management will say there is voluntary severance, which I cannot fathom.  Some employees in the same company are being told there will be voluntary severance.  I am not only referring to permanent employees, but temporary employees also.  Some temporary employees, who have worked for four or five months, have been told if they request voluntary severance, it will be available.  However, there are other drivers with perhaps nine, ten or 11 months' service who are told it will not be available.  That is no way to treat staff.  Questions should be asked in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Part of the plans and proposals put to us include the introduction of part-time workers.  We envisage a scenario in future where routes are cut and buses are taken off the road.  We may come a point where we will have to tell our people to work 20 hours per week as a driver and that they might also get 20 hours part time work as a taxi driver or a Luas driver.  Who is competing against whom there?  That is the reality we are facing and the stupidity of the road we are going down.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">We are quite clearly saying that if a pilot scheme is being put forward by the Deloitte report, which there is, why not try it and see if it works?  We will not be found wanting on that.  One can put it out there, give the travelling public a choice and let the travelling public decide on what it wants.  There are buses and drivers at the moment.  Why not try it?  If one tries it and it works, it can be used as a template for somewhere else.  That is the main point I want to put across.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">If I understand Deputy Broughan's question correctly, he asked if we had any idea where Bus Éireann were taking out the buses around the country.  What it is talking about is taking out 25 buses in Dublin.  It has not put numbers of people on this for us out of the various places.  It talked about taking 12 buses out of Dundalk, 30 out of Cork, 15 out of Waterford, four out of Tralee, 15 out of Galway, three out of Athlone, four out of Sligo, one out of Ballina, two out of Stranorlar and demand trend for Q1 2009 being 15 buses, a total of 150 buses.  That is the way it has been given to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I have been a trade union official for a very long time, dealing with different industries and different types of work.  I have dealt across a fairly wide range of areas.  I have dealt with Bus Éireann for a long time as well.  I have not ever walked away from the table on perceived necessary changes to bring about efficiencies.  However, the one thing I will walk away from the table on is forced lay-offs or redundancies without trying the voluntary route first.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">It is essential that a message is sent quite clearly to the company from this union that if an absolute need can be established for cutbacks — I am not convinced that there is there yet — we are prepared to talk about cut-backs on a voluntary basis first.  There cannot be a compulsory route first and then a voluntary one afterwards.  We do not want to see a situation where certain grades will get golden handshakes and people who, as Deputy Broughan said earlier, left jobs to go to more secure jobs with better pay will be forced out and will be unable to pay a mortgage or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">These people have done nothing but turn up for work, contract their labour to the company and work faithfully for it since they joined.  It is not acceptable that they could then be turfed out as if they had made off with the millions some of the bankers have made off with.  We need to protect communities where there will be growing and serious unemployment.  All of us must ensure that a public service transport——</p>

It is one thing to say there is a €30 million deficit but there is the whole question of where it is coming from, how it arises and where it happens which will take some detailed examination.  If we have that information at least we can look at it, but this is all we have.</p>

          <from>Mr. John Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_419">To pick up a point Mr. McCarthy talked about, the details the company has given are just overviews.  Mr. Faherty said, correctly, that Mr. Hayes is holding the integration of the network in place.  If he is holding it in place, why does he not come out and tell the workers and the people what he proposes?  I will tell the committee why.  He is afraid of the reaction because he is unable to keep integration there.  Mr. McCarthy talked about buses.  Some of them have one driver and some have one and a half drivers, depending on where they are located.  The impact of this will be quite dramatic and that is why the company will not come out and give the details.  It knows the impact of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I sit on the board and we have not received the details.  I know there has been a significant economic change herd and right throughout the world, but it was only last year we discussed development through the Transport 21 initiative.  Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus recruited drivers based on it and the forecast developments.  It is not the fault of these people that the economy has turned down like it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The companies now have no loyalty to them at all.  They are seeking a reduction in staff of 10%.  All we are saying is that whether they can achieve the 10% reduction, it should at least be investigated through the voluntary severance option.  It has to be investigated.  Otherwise we cannot even sit down to talk about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">Coming back to the Chairman's question, Deputy O'Dowd, when Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus made their presentations, struggled manfully to find something in the Deloitte report that would support his view on life and his policy, which, as we know, is privatisation.  He ignored at all times what it said was good about the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">To return to the Chairman's question, it will be extremely difficult to bridge the gap of €31 million or €28 million in the other company because one of the main areas here is the cost base.  The Deloitte report was done on behalf of the Minister.  If Dublin Bus itself commissioned this report, one would say "of course it would do that" but it was done on behalf of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The cost base indicates they are sufficient as comparable organisations.  The cost base, to which everybody looks to see how the company is performing, is correct.  The current funding, which is where the problem arises is low by comparison, which we all know.  The report goes on to give several examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The Chairman knows the last time we were here people talked about the London model which has been held up as a panacea for all these things.  Even London, we were told, counted its figures — our figures would be higher — and they were 10% higher than Dublin Bus.  When we go on to efficiencies, the report says it is as efficient as its peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The wage situation is described as being similar to the industry average.  There is nothing out of the ordinary there.  The scheduling of drivers and buses was mentioned.  Deputy Broughan referred to 20%.  The report says it is generally sufficient compared with international benchmarks.  As workers, what are we doing that is wrong?  Our members, who are the staff, are doing their job.  I am no expert, but if there is a problem maybe we are unable, for whatever reason, to get enough people out of their cars and on to buses to give us the additional revenue we need.  Perhaps that is where the problem is.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Alternatively, there is an issue with the State and the funding of the company.  It is a combination of both of those issues.  Where does one come up with ideas to save €31 million?  The only thing I can say is that we have been confronted with many challenges in the past in the three companies.  We worked our way through them.  We have never been involved in anything as serious as this on a national scale.  We appreciate the situation the country is in.  Once we can get over the hurdle of the sackings, with which we cannot get involved, and into negotiations, who knows what ideas, such as network changes, people will suggest?  Unless we get into negotiations there is no prospect of addressing this issue.</p>

Everybody knows where the Luas is going and the notice board displays the next three trains due.  A bus from Heuston might drop one at the other side of O'Connell Street one day and at a different place the next day.  One is not exactly sure where one is.

There is an excellent service with buses every few minutes and many more extra passengers but there are still many whose mindset prevents them getting on a bus.  I am a convert.  I would not have dreamt of getting on a bus until I got this job.  Now I take buses all over the place and it is a good and pleasant and cheaper experience.  That is the biggest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Faherty have spoken about opportunities, particularly for Dublin Bus in our present crisis.  Their responses to our points about the expansion of Dublin Bus have been positive but that is an opportunity that should be considered.  It will involve some radical thinking about how in the short term we can get people to leave the car and take the bus on the radial routes into Dublin.  That will have an impact on congestion and on Dublin Bus.  This applies equally but in a more difficult way to Bus Éireann.  in Galway a bus lane and new buses were put on the route from Deoch Uisce to the city which contributes one third of the total city revenue of Bus Éireann in Galway.  This can be done.  That happened as a result of a good initiative on the part of the union and Bus Éireann management in Galway, and the fact that a bus lane was put in.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">As a former driver and daily bus user for the past ten years, I ask what would make someone standing at a bus stop go back to his or her house to get the car.  If one stands at a bus stop in the cold and wind and rain one will decide to bring the car the next day.  The answer is reliability and frequency.  Irrespective of who the manager or management team are at Dublin Bus, it is not possible to keep the buses running to timetable except on the 50% of routes that have a quality bus corridor.  That is the same as the Luas or a metro.  The problem starts when one runs out of QBC.  The 20B bus that leaves Beaumont Hospital gate runs on a QBC for half the journey.  At peak time, 8 a.m., it takes 40 or 45 minutes to do the first half of that trip to the Malahide Road where it joins the QBC at Donnycarney church and does the other half of the trip in 15 minutes.  That sums up the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">Our report emphasised speeding up the QBCs but until that happens we need to change the mindset of those drivers whose cars clog up that section and get them onto the bus.</p>

          <from>Mr. Michael Faherty</from>
          <p eId="para_439">We would like the Chairman to bring the message to the Minister that while we wait for the metro and the rest of the QBCs the bus is the only answer.  The Minister is going down the wrong road.  He should at least leave what is available and not reduce the service.  Somebody is making a huge mistake.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">It is not possible to sustain the current losses.  There has been a significant downturn in passenger numbers because people are not going to work.  I hope that before action is taken the witnesses will consider some of the opportunities available such as people using buses again because they no longer have a second car.  I wish the best of luck to Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Faherty and the management of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann in trying to find those alternatives and reforms, instead of letting people go.</p>

I am a firm believer in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann providing services but I genuinely am concerned that if they continue as they are it will be difficult to convince the public that someone else should not be given the opportunity to provide the service.  Everyone has a responsibility——</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I will not answer the Ryanair question because my colleagues have covered that.  Regarding the Virgin example, was the Chairman relying on anecdotal evidence or did he do some research on Virgin?  I did not do any research but from my experience of travelling in the United Kingdom, I am aware that Virgin has a very successful service.  It has lines into densely populated areas and charges very high fares.  I use lightly used lines in the UK which provide a poor service using very poor trains.  That is because the operators are trying to drive down costs to make a profit.  That is my example.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">I do not agree with the privatisation of the bus service in London.  We have studied that carefully but some of my colleagues in the British Parliament, and they are not Tories, gave me the example of the way Virgin has turned around the rail service in Britain, after experiencing many problems.  I am not saying that is the way we should proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">As was pointed out earlier, Iarnród Éireann has not had a loss in its passenger numbers because it is providing an excellent service.  If we can get our act together on this issue — unions, management and Government — we can turn around this service.  Mr. Faherty is correct.  We need a good bus service in Dublin in the next five or six years if we are to face all the disruption caused by construction and so on.  That is why the first report we produced was the two-year action plan for Dublin Bus, which spells out what needs to be done.  I thank the representatives for attending.</p>
