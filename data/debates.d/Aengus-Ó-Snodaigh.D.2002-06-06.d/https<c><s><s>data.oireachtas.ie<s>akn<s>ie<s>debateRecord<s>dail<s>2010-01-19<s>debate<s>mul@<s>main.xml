            <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and 161 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">I appointed the innovation task force on 29 June 2009 to advise the Government on its strategy for positioning Ireland as an international innovation development hub and to assist in making the smart economy a reality.  The members of the innovation task force have a wide range of expertise and include individuals with global experience in international companies and entrepreneurs who have recently established and grown successful start-up companies.  There is also representation from the higher education sector and senior representatives from a number of Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">The task force has met in plenary session for all day meetings in Government Buildings on four occasions thus far, on 17 July, 25 September, 30 October and 14 December.  I addressed the first meeting of the task force and was accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for innovation, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  The Minister of State also attended the meetings of 30 October and 14 December.  In addition, a full day consultation meeting for task force members was held on 19 October.  The task force is due to meet again on 29 January.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">The task force has established four working groups focusing on specific aspects of its terms of reference.  These working groups, which are chaired by private sector members of the task force, have been meeting regularly and a draft report is currently being finalised to reflect their deliberations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">To assist with its work, the task force issued a public request for submissions and received over 100 responses from interested groups and individuals.  These submissions have been reviewed by members of the task force and will feed into its deliberations on the content of its report.  A summary document highlighting key themes and proposals from the submissions has been published and is available on the innovation task force's website.  The task force is due to meet again on 29 January.  I look forward to receiving its report, which I understand will be finalised shortly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_10">I welcome the Taoiseach back to the House.  On 18 December 2008, the Government published Ireland's framework for sustainable economic renewal.  That document, although launched with great fanfare, was merely a rehash of several programmes which were already in place with the notable addition of an innovation fund of €500 million.  The document refused to make any of the difficult decisions which need to accompany infrastructural development if we are to give rise to compatibility in innovation with our European Union counterparts.  Can the Taoiseach indicate the source of the aforementioned €500 million?  Was it allocated through various Departments' Votes or was new money put up?</p>
            <p eId="para_11">What is the function of the task force and the four subgroups in regard to encouraging and overseeing the work of universities, third level colleges and other organisations which deal with innovation in the context of the European framework?  Clearly, the new Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science will have a substantial budget.  Does the Taoiseach envisage the innovation task force having a role in overseeing and encouraging organisations and firms which are interested in innovation to become compatible with the European framework and thereby receive funding for appropriate programmes?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The innovation fund is part of our five-year programme.  It aims to raise funds from private sector venture capital investors who also bring their expertise to the country.  The role of the State will be to provide structures and incentives to best leverage private sector investment.  This is why the NTMA, which is an expert in this area, is leading the process.  The amount required directly from the Exchequer is likely to be small relative to the overall size of the fund.  Investment will only be required from the State as the fund grows over a number of years to an envisaged total of €500 million.  Alternative models are currently being tested with potential venture capital investors and other stakeholders, particularly in the United States.  Detailed decisions will be possible only following completion of that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">The objective is to identify and leverage private sector venture capital funds, including funds from the United States, to complement and augment the seed capital and other funds available within Enterprise Ireland, for example, for assisting high-potential start-up companies and other companies which merit or obtain market support on the basis of the product, process development or innovation they are undertaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">In the past ten years we have trebled the level of investment in research and development to some €2.5 billion, two thirds of which is leveraged in the private sector.  We have devised a single income stream for the science, technology and innovation moneys from the Department, which are under the auspices of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  The function of the task force on innovation, which will come forward shortly with its recommendations, is to identify how we can assist high-potential start-ups more successfully so that they can be the future market leaders in the various sectors from which they spring.  A more general objective is to promote higher productivity through innovation across all sectors of the economy, but the expertise in this area relates to those start-up proposals and enterprises to which I referred.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_15">Will the Taoiseach confirm how much has been committed or promised from private venture sources in respect of moneys for innovation?  The task force on innovation was set up with a six-month remit, which is due to expire at the end of January.  If we are to receive a report, it must be produced by the end of the month or else the lifetime of the committee must be extended.  Which is the case?</p>
            <p eId="para_16">There is no disagreement among Members regarding the possibilities and potential for job creation arising from innovation.  First, there has been much discussion of what can be done in the area of energy, including wind, wave power, tidal power, pump storage, natural gas and so on.  There is no reason that this State should not be a world leader in some of these niche areas of renewable energy.  Will the task force examine that potential?</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Second, we have all the ingredients to be a world leader in the area of biotechnology, whether arising from the clusters of medical companies in operation throughout the State or through the availability of resources and research from our universities and other third level institutions, including, for example, the Marine Institute.  All these elements provide us with absolute potential in terms of world leadership in the biotechnology area.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">Third, all the major multinational information technology companies already have a presence here, a sector in which developments are taking place at blinding speed.  These are three areas where we can clearly see the potential for innovation, as exemplified on a smaller scale by the young scientists last week.  All of that potential is there to be harnessed in the next 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">Will the task force look at the bigger picture and the longer view where there is clearly potential for substantial job creation and job sustainability arising from innovation?  That will clearly require a longer-term remit for the task force than its initial six-month allocation.  Irrespective of political positions, this is something that will stand to us, but it will require encouragement and clarity of objective from Government.  Will the Taoiseach ensure, having chaired its first meeting, that the task force on innovation and its four sub-committees will focus on these clear areas of massive potential for the State?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_20">We received a detailed report recently on the area of green enterprise from the group under the chairmanship of Joe Harford, who is also a member of the innovation taskforce.  That is a linkage in terms of those two exercises which is beneficial.  The outcome of the recommendations by the innovation taskforce will take cognisance of that and be very much aware of the potential that has been identified by the green enterprise group that recently reported detailed proposals for the creation of new jobs and businesses in the green technology area.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">On the question of the level of funds, we are in the process of seeking to design the fund in a way that will attract private sector venture capital funds.  That is precisely what is going on.  The NTMA team is in the United States this week as part of that process of market testing how it can devise a fund that will assist and augment existing seed capital and other venture capital funds that are currently under the auspices of, for example, Enterprise Ireland, quite apart from the private sector venture capital industry in this country in any event.  The record has shown US venture capital funds and other venture capital funds in Europe are helpful in commercialising ideas for start-up enterprises far more quickly where they can identify potential.  Such funds have worked very well, for example, in Israel and elsewhere.  That is the concept we are seeking to develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The taskforce will report shortly.  It has broken up into a number of working groups comprising a number of very well qualified people who are involved in the business of start-up companies themselves, as well as people from Departments.  The terms of reference that were given to the group less than six months ago draw on the lessons from successful international and national models in the area of the strategy for science, technology and innovation.  The group was to examine options, increase levels of innovation and the rates of commercialisation of research and development on a national basis with a view to accelerating the growth and scale-up of indigenous enterprise and to attract new knowledge-intensive direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">The taskforce was also to seek to bring forward proposals for enhancing the linkages between institutions, agencies and organisations in the public and private sectors to ensure a cohesive innovation and commercialisation ecosystem.  It was also to identify any specific policy measures that might be necessary to support the concept of Ireland as an international innovation development hub, including in the areas of legislation, educational policy, intellectual property arrangements, venture capital and immigration policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">A number of working groups have been set up because of the relatively limited reporting timeframe of six months and the significant expertise and experience of members.  It was considered that the establishment of a number of focused working groups was the best way to progress the terms of reference and consider certain aspects of the work programme.  For example, the first group deals with incentives, intellectual property and venture capital, identifying measures to increase innovation, commercialisation and entrepreneurship, including changes to incentives, venture capital arrangements and intellectual property strategies.  Another group is focusing on commercialisation, technology transfer and converging technologies, including examining institutional structures for research and development funding delivery, how to maximise commercialisation of research, increase technology transfer and promote innovation in converging technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">A further group is considering how to achieve the innovation island concept, how to position and promote this country as the innovation island, including attracting entrepreneurs, foreign direct investment, international start-ups and private sector research and development investment.  The fourth group is examining the international innovation development hub Dublin, supporting the various alliances that have taken place in the university system, for example, including identifying necessary supporting policy measures.  Much good work is being done.  A great deal of seriousness of intent and time is being given voluntarily by many people to assist in bringing forward ideas based on what has been outlined in the terms of reference.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_26">The Government's approach to the task force seems to have all the lack of urgency that is so typical of this Government.  The idea of an innovation task force was announced by the Government in December 2008 with great fanfare in Dublin Castle to introduce the Government's plans for a smart economy.  It took all of six months to get the task force set up, and it was not set up until June of last year.  The last time the Taoiseach answered questions in the House about this task force, he told us it would report early in the new year.  This is early in the new year and I see now it will meet again at the end of January and the report will be sometime after that.  Meanwhile, there are 423,595 people on the live register, 84,000 of whom are under 25, many of them the kind of young people who are emigrating and who we would expect should be working in the smart economy, if we had one.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">Has this task force made any recommendation to date to Government in respect of any measure that the Government might have taken to advance the smart economy and innovation in this country?  Was any specific recommendation made to Government in advance of the recent budget, for example, which might have informed the provisions of that budget, or lack of them, in respect of measures to generate employment?  Is it envisaged that this task force will make any recommendation or have any report made to Government before the Finance Bill so that any measures that are contained in it in respect of start-up capital incentives and so on might be included in the Bill?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_28">I reject Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that there is a delay involved.  There is much very good work ongoing, and I do not accept that six months is a long time to give the task force to do that work.  Quite apart from the innovation task force that was mentioned at the launch of the smart economy framework, many other initiatives were also mentioned.  That framework is a comprehensive strategy covering not just innovation and research and development but all aspects of economic renewal.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">There have, in fact, been tax changes to support the smart economy, including an improved research and development tax credit, new tax arrangements for intellectual property and tax incentives for start-up companies and to encourage venture capital companies to locate in Ireland.  Indeed, at the time of the publication of the smart economy document, in preparation for the Finance Bill last year, these sorts of changes were incorporated so one would not have had to wait for a report for that to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">I have outlined in previous replies what is the purpose of this task force's work at present.  New technology initiatives to support a smart economy have also taken place, including the development of a new international content services centre, making Ireland the leading location for energy efficient data centres such as the Microsoft centre I opened during last year, which saw an investment of over €500 million.  There are a number of other issues in the whole renewable energy area and, as I said, we now have the green enterprise group, which reported last month with a series of recommendations which will also be helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">As the Deputy will be aware, there is a need to support a culture of innovation to help start-up companies and to make sure we have the right processes and policies in place, whether they be fiscal or in regard to intellectual property.  A number of changes have already taken place in that area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_32">Can the Taoiseach be more specific than he has been up to now with regard to when this task force will actually report?  I understand from him that there is a meeting towards the end of January, probably on 29 January.  Is that to be the final meeting of the task force?  Is it the meeting at which it will conclude its report?  When does the Taoiseach expect that the report will be presented?  To whom will the task force report?</p>
            <p eId="para_33">In September, I attended a good event in Farmleigh at which leading business people from various parts of the world, many from North America, with connections to Ireland were assembled.  The weekend was bubbling with good ideas for economic development in Ireland.  What happened with this?  It was my understanding that a report was to be produced and circulated to participants, but I got no such report.  I do not know whether one has been prepared.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House of the follow-up to the September Farmleigh event?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_34">The Minister for Foreign Affairs produced a report on that and it was put on the website.  However, as Deputy Gilmore says, there are ideas that have to be taken forward and concepts that have to be developed.  A great deal of work is being done in respect of some of those mentioned at the conference and it will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">On the innovation task force, I make the point that the next meeting will be, if not the last, then the penultimate meeting and I expect a report in the next couple of months, based on how advanced things are at the moment.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_36">The Taoiseach cited several smart economy initiatives that have been taken in the innovation area.  Regarding a specific initiative mentioned, Innovation Fund Ireland's €500 million was to increase the availability of capital to small research and development companies.  How much of that fund, if any, has been accessed?  What is the current take-up and the processing procedure regarding same?</p>
            <p eId="para_37">In earlier replies, the Taoiseach cited a number of areas, each of which we welcome.  However, I am sure the House would like to know how much of the matter is still paperwork and how much has occurred in terms of delivery.  How many companies have been able to access and are currently benefiting from announced innovation?</p>
            <p eId="para_38">Something caught the imagination during the course of last year, namely, the ESB's announcement of the creation of some 3,700 new jobs covering the areas of new meters, smart networks, electric vehicles and wind energy to name but a few.  This announcement was lauded and applauded by the Taoiseach's Department at the time and rightly so if the former delivers.  How many of the promised 3,700 additional jobs within the ESB have been created?  Has the Taoiseach concern regarding initiatives being announced and the timeframe between their announcement and the actual production of real jobs?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_39">I mentioned in earlier replies to Deputy Kenny the nature of the fund and its progress.  It is about augmenting and supplementing existing funds, including venture capital, start-up and seed capital funds in the private sector and those provided by Enterprise Ireland, for example.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is providing almost €300 million this year for science, technology and innovation.  This is a significant contribution, as the Deputy will agree.  Enterprise Ireland is allocated €129 million of that.  This is used to put Irish companies at the cutting edge of development and ahead of their competitors.  It provides equity funding to high-potential start-up companies.  It continues its research and development grant programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises.  It supports innovation partnerships between enterprises and universities.  It funds three competence centres and announced and confirmed funding to further centres during the year.  It continues the innovation voucher programme and provides support for near-to-the-market commercialisation.  It supports researchers and companies competing for the EU Framework 7 programme to leverage a target amount of €600 million up to 2013.  This is what the State moneys in place at the moment do.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">The point I was making is that the level of investment in research and development now stands at €2.5 billion, which is three times what it was a decade ago.  Science Foundation Ireland did not exist before this Fianna Fáil-led Administration came back into office in 1997.  There was no arrangement in place then for promoting research and development as a central plank of economic policy for sustainable development into the future.  It did not exist.  All that has happened and has provided a great deal of investment for companies that are now providing jobs.  Science Foundation Ireland has been allocated €162 million.  In protecting this budget, the Government recognises the pivotal role it plays in the framework for sustainable, economic renewal.  That allocation consolidates its investments to date; it leverages them for maximum outputs; it continues to support 29 major research centres; and partners with 150 small and medium-sized enterprises and blue chip multinationals in Ireland.  It has been a vital driver of major investment decisions by both overseas and indigenous companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">If one notes more than 40% of IDA investment wins are in the area of research, development and innovation worth more than €400 million annually, that gives an indication as to what is the bang for the buck.  Clearly, in more difficult times one has to ensure that the funding goes to the best possible projects and that commercialisation is brought forward and not simply pure research but applied research.  Science Foundation Ireland's allocation allows us to continue to fund high-quality scientific research and researchers in recognition that they are the drivers needed to develop Ireland into a high-value, knowledge-based economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">On the question the Deputy asked about the innovation fund, as I explained earlier, we are market-testing that fund with the United States.  We want to bring in more money from the private sector, particularly successful venture capital companies in the United States which have shown a track record in being able to identify and invest in start-up companies that then take the next step forward and internationalise their business, etc.  The NTMA is charged with that process on our behalf and is currently operating in the United States as part of the process.  The Deputy will accept that last year was not a very propitious year for obtaining venture capital investments, given the overall economic downturn, but this is part of a five-year programme.  It is one of our initiatives and it is ongoing; there is no question of it lying in abeyance or anything like that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_43">It would be unfair of me to expect that the Taoiseach could give us an update on the uptake on the programme at this point, but can he clarify that he indicated in his reply that the National Treasury Management Agency is currently exploring the potential of attracting into this economy new inward investors in research and development with a proven record in the United States?  Is that the exclusive focus of the €500 million Innovation Fund Ireland?  Will it not also focus on existing small companies based in this economy in terms of aiding and abetting further research and development?</p>
            <p eId="para_44">I understand this would not have been part of what the Taoiseach prepared for this reply, but will he undertake to give me an informed reply on the ESB announcement last year of 3,700 jobs, which caught the imagination of the people and was very welcomed at the time, but we have never——</p>

            <p eId="para_47">As the Deputy will know, that announcement was in respect of a very direct change in policy by the ESB to promote sustainable energy initiatives to help build more sustainable energy projects in Ireland over a period of years.  It was not suggested that 3,900 jobs would be created over night, but the company indicated it was committed.  It made the commitment in terms of investment and over a period of years it believes it will create that number of jobs.  That is its policy and it is implementing it.  A more detailed reply from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will elicit what progress has been made on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">With regard to the other point made by the Deputy, the NTMA — because of its position in terms of dealing with funds and with this area generally — is assisting the relevant Departments in designing and market-testing a fund to attract the interest of venture capitalists.  This work must be done although success in the outcome is not guaranteed.  One must go out and do it and see what can be achieved.  Other countries — including Israel, which set up what is known as the Yozma fund — have been successful in this regard.  This does not guarantee success for us, but we are in the process of providing such a fund because we believe that in addition to traditional areas of finance for companies in the start-up phase, venture capital can provide the pump-priming necessary to commercialise an idea or concept and ensure it has a sustainable future.  It is not the case in every enterprise but there are some for which that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">The fund will supplement State provision.  The State is already investing directly in seed capital funding and providing equity to start-up companies through the Enterprise Ireland programmes.  The question is how we can develop a private-sector venture capital fund which is independent of the taxpayer but supports national objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">The agreements referred to are political agreements entered into by my predecessor as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party with individual Independent Deputies — namely, Deputies Healy-Rae and Lowry.  On becoming leader of Fianna Fáil, I confirmed to the Deputies concerned that I would continue to implement those agreements.  As the House is aware, such arrangements have existed for more than 12 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">The agreements are confidential but are, as always, based on the programme for Government, which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual Estimates for capital and current expenditure.  I have continued the practice whereby a staff member in my office assists the Chief Whip's office in its work in liaising with these Deputies.  The staff member meets the Deputies on a regular basis and arranges to keep them briefed on issues as they arise.  No changes have been made to these arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">As is the case on almost all such occasions, Deputy Healy-Rae availed of the opportunity, in the course of the passage of budget 2010 before Christmas — in return, allegedly, for his support in the passage of the budget and all votes related to it, including the disgraceful and savage cuts in social welfare supports — to declare that he had secured a deal from the Government regarding a promised 40-bed hospital facility in Kenmare.  The Taoiseach has the Minister for Health and Children at his side.  Is it not the case, as was my understanding, that a commitment to establish a 40-bed hospital facility in Kenmare had issued 12 months previously from the HSE?  Either it was a <i>quid pro quo</i> for Deputy Healy-Rae’s support in the passage of budget 2010 or it was not.  Certainly, the Deputy has sought to impress on everyone that such a deal was done and that there were other elements of the deal which related to his constituency of Kerry South.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">Can the Taoiseach inform the House whether he, or representatives of his Department, met Deputy Healy-Rae to discuss his support for budget 2010?  Was the establishment of a 40-bed hospital in Kenmare one of the matters discussed?  What other matters were discussed?  Are these matters — including the hospital facility — new elements of existing arrangements between the Government and the Independent Deputy for Kerry South?  Did similar engagements take place with other Deputies who are currently——</p>

            <p eId="para_64">Deputy Grealish was reported to have met the Taoiseach on 8 December in advance of the budget that he also supported.  What can the Taoiseach tell Members about this meeting?  What of the meeting with Deputies Scanlon and Devins?  Were hospital upgrades and major road repairs, which I note from the statements issued by both Deputies representing the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency, promised in return for their votes?  Each of them supported budget 2010 and the subsequent disgraceful measures in respect of social welfare.  Is this the case that such Deputies, with whom the Taoiseach allegedly has a standing arrangement going back to 2007 and the formation of the Government, can up the ante every time the Government presents budget proposals or other measures such as Members have gone through all too frequently in the closing months of last year?  Do they continue to be in a position to ratchet up their demands on the public purse regarding their own respective constituency needs?  The Taoiseach should clarify the position and shed some light regarding the current arrangements with the Government of each of these Deputies in the context of budget 2010, which was introduced in the early stages of last December.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_21">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_65">As I have stated previously, no changes were made to the arrangements in advance of the budget.  Obviously, I meet Deputies on all sides of the House from time to time, with varying degrees of success depending on their disposition.  I make the point that political agreements and arrangements are in place.  I would be hesitant were the Deputy to try to second-guess how Deputy Healy-Rae wishes to communicate with his constituents.  That is a matter for Deputy Healy-Rae.  It is true that the requirements for a community hospital in Kenmare have been long sought and have been supported by Deputy Healy-Rae and others for some time.  If Deputy Healy-Rae wishes to communicate to his constituents the validity of his support for the Government by giving another indication of how they benefit from his support of the Government, as distinct from those who oppose it, he would take that small advantage whenever it arises.  Were Deputy Ó Caoláin in the same position, he would not be too far behind the door himself.  It is time to recognise that there are Members who support the Government and who have political arrangements that were completed by my predecessor and which continue in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">As for other Members, Deputies Devins and Scanlon are members of the Fianna Fáil Party, albeit not members of the parliamentary party at present.  I am glad to note the Government was in a position to confirm the developments for Sligo General Hospital, which were possible on the basis that they were required.  Contrary to what the Deputy seems to suggest, it is not the case that the proposals as put forward lack merit.  They have merit and have been in planning for some time.  From my perspective, yes, I meet Deputies.  I met Deputies Lowry and Grealish and many people.  Before a budget, it always is timely to speak to Ministers and the Government regarding arrangements and agreements that are in place to enable it to try to assist where it can, consistent with programme for Government commitments.  An examination of any of these projects would reveal them to have merit and I understand they are well supported by all sides of the House.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_67">In a brief follow-on to the Taoiseach's response, I note that while it is all very well to make the point that Deputy Healy Rae will employ all means and methods of communicating with his constituents, this is a case of smoke and mirrors.  The Taoiseach is playing that game himself by not being absolutely up-front in his response.  A nod and wink approach always is taken in this regard and it is not all on Deputy Healy-Rae's side. It is also on the Taoiseach's side because he would have us believe, as the Minister for Health and Children, who is beside him, has stated <i>ad nauseam</i>, that the HSE makes determinations in regard to hospital configuration and the network.  I have heard that probably more often than any Deputy given the constituency I represent and my home county of Monaghan.  However, the Taoiseach is happy to allow Deputy Healy-Rae make whatever claims he likes and he is not prepared to discount them and to make it clear that is not the way hospital facilities are secured.  I wish the people of Kenmare well and while I support the provision of such a facility, I want equity across the board and equal access to all hospital services.  Does the Taoiseach agree a more upfront reply from him would clarify for all Deputies and the wider populace the position that must apply to the configuration of hospital services and it is not a gift he or anyone else can offer to a Deputy as a trade off for his or her support and votes in the House?</p>

Nobody has ever put them on the record of the House or told us exactly what is in them.  It is a bit like chasing the Holy Grail.  I have come to the conclusion that there are no agreements.  Every time Deputies Healy-Rae and Lowry say they have secured something for their constituency, a Minister says it was in the pipeline anyway.  When Deputies Devins and Scanlon said they secured the hospital extension for Sligo, they were told it was coming anyway.  The reality is that Deputies Healy-Rae and Lowry and other Deputies like them who support the Government have sold out the pensioners and their constituents and all they have in return is the pleasure of a periodic private meeting with the Taoiseach.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_41" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_88">The Department of Social and Family Affairs assists social welfare recipients with heating costs, through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance scheme and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">The household benefits package is payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households to assist them with their heating, light and cooking costs.  This scheme cost approximately €200 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">In addition, the national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the additional cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full and must be seen in the context of the overall level of income available to the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">In budget 2009, the duration of the payment was increased by an extra two weeks to 32 weeks, while the weekly value of the allowance was increased by €2 to €20 a week, or €23.90 in designated smokeless areas.  This compares with just €14 and €17.90 respectively three years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">These are in addition to other improvements made in recent years, including a significant increase in the income threshold for the allowance with effect from 2008.  A single person aged under 80, with a household income of less than €330.30 a week can now qualify for the fuel allowance.  The income limits for couples are €483.80 a week where the qualified adult is aged under 66 and €536.80 a week where both adults are aged over 66.  As a result of these improvements, almost 318,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2009 at an estimated cost of €217 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">In addition to the basic welfare payments, household benefits and fuel allowance payments highlighted above, the Department also provides funding to the community welfare service to assist people with special heating needs.  Community welfare officers can pay a heating supplement to people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  They can also make exceptional needs payments to people who do not have enough money to meet their heating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">Since the onset of the adverse weather conditions, community welfare officers have provided assistance to people to purchase additional fuel, heaters and clothing.  They have also given funding towards the payment of heating bills and for repairs arising from burst pipes.  More than €170,000 has been paid out since 1 January 2010 in respect of such claims.  Assistance will continue to be provided towards the payment of heating bills for those in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">Paying a special increase in response to the bad weather would not necessarily represent a good targeting of limited resources.  Rather, it is considered desirable to continue to give community welfare officers the discretion and the funding to assist people who need extra financial support.</p>

          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_42">
            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_96">I find it peculiar that one third of the Minister's answer relates to community welfare officers as a question I tabled for today on the community welfare service was disallowed because it does not come under the Minister's responsibility.  To deal with the question in hand, I very much disagree with the Minister.  Does she not see and appreciate the difficulty in asking people on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare to bear the brunt of the type of weather we have had in recent weeks?  Certainly, it is unfair to ask them in general — the Minister has not done so — to conserve energy when they do so on such a limited budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">Was the Minister involved in the emergency committee established to deal with the bad weather?  Did the committee consider the difficulties being experienced by people on low incomes and on social welfare as a result of requiring far more fuel than normal?  The renewed programme for Government contained a commitment to publish a fuel poverty strategy by the end of last year.  This has not been published.  When are we likely to see it published?  It was decided in the budget to introduce a carbon tax, which will have a significant impact on those in receipt of the fuel allowance.  Does the Minister have any plans to alleviate the difficulties that will be experienced by people as a result of this?</p>

However, I expect that when bills for the fuel begin to arrive we will see the real demand.  People have not yet received their electricity or fuel bills.  Gas and electricity bills will not be received for two months and those who use oil will also see how much has been used.  I anticipate greater demand at that stage——</p>

An interdepartmental group on energy affordability has been established and that will address both issues.  We are conscious of the fact that a carbon tax on heating products will come into effect from May but it will be September before solid fuels come in.  We should have a targeted response but we must find the most efficient way to target and administer it.</p>

        <b>Deputy Róisín Shortall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         if she will amend the back to education allowance to address a number of inadequacies such as its lack of compatibility with the academic year; the length of time an applicant must be unemployed to qualify for this scheme; the restricted access for persons who already have third level qualifications; and the restricted access to students pursuing other back to education type programs. 
        [2062/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_52" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_109">The primary objective of the back to education allowance, BTEA, is to give welfare recipients who left school early and those without third level qualifications a second chance to attain educational qualifications so as to reduce their risk of long-term unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">In order to qualify for participation, an applicant must generally be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for three months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  In May 2009, the qualifying period for access to third level courses was reduced to nine months for people engaging with the Department's facilitator programme, thereby aligning with the existing similar threshold for people within the national employment action plan.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">Acceptance into the back to education allowance scheme can result in a person receiving income support for three years or more if pursuing a degree course.  It is, therefore, considered appropriate, in the context of limited resources, to ensure that such long-term support is only given to those who actually need it.  The waiting periods for the scheme act as a disincentive for people to leave education early with a view to getting paid the BTEA to complete it soon after.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">It is worth noting that the maximum rate of the back to education allowance is more than double the maximum rate of the maintenance grant available to third level students from the lowest income families.  It could, therefore, be considered unfair if a young person could finish school, work for a couple of years and then secure three years worth of BTEA support after being unemployed for only a very short time, while another young person who went straight from school into third level would get far less financial support.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">The BTEA is currently limited to full-time courses from second level to higher diploma level in any discipline and to a graduate diploma in education.  Qualifications above this level would not generally be considered necessary to secure employment.  Payment under the scheme covers the relevant academic year and the scheme caters for approved courses where the starting date is not aligned to the standard academic year.  Under separate arrangements, job seekers can participate in a part-time course and maintain their welfare entitlements, provided they obtain approval in advance and continue to satisfy all relevant conditions, such as being available for work.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">In 2009, €87.8 million was provided for the BTEA scheme.  The number of people on the scheme at the end of November 2009 was 20,418, which is 88% higher than the 10,854 recorded at the end of November 2008.  The scheme is being monitored on an ongoing basis in the light of the changed economic circumstances, in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</p>

            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_115">The Minister said at the outset that this scheme was intended for early school leavers.  The point I am making is that the qualifying criteria for the scheme are very outdated and do not meet the needs of the newly unemployed.  It is fine for the Minister to talk about the minor changes she has made, which are welcome, but the reality is that there has been unprecedented growth in unemployment.  One in five unemployed people are under 25.  There are many graduates who are drawing the dole.  The restricted nature of this scheme means that many people who should be able to avail of it are not entitled to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">It would make a lot of sense for the Minister to provide education and training opportunities to those who are on the dole who are precluded from participating in any courses.  This problem is relatively new and it needs new solutions.  The Minister should consider sitting down with some of the groups who work with unemployed people and try to identify some of those barriers that currently prevent them from participating in training.  The current system encourages long-term unemployment.  With a little tweaking of the rules, this could be a much more effective intervention for people who find themselves unemployed.  Will the Minister apply herself to identifying those blockages?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_54" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_117">The Deputy has acknowledged that we have made necessary changes and I am open to making more.  We need to ensure that we keep qualifying criteria for the link with social welfare.  We must also ensure that there is a time lag because problems can arise if there is no waiting time.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">The Deputy referred to graduates.  Traditionally, we have not gone beyond the higher diploma.  I accept that there are graduates on the live register, but they can also benefit from the work placement programme and hold on to their social welfare benefits.  This may enable them to become more prepared for employment.  There are other options available for people.  Through FÁS, the Department of Education and Science and the PLC courses, a great number of additional places have also been made available.  There are people who may not qualify for the back to the education allowance but who would qualify for the third level grant.  That would allow people to continue with their education.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">I meet with groups all the time but if there are other practical suggestions that allow more people to participate then I am very open to that.  The numbers went up by 88% last year but because more people will be qualifying again this year, more people will be participating as well.  We issued a mailshot to 18 to 25 year olds this time last year, and this was quite successful because it forced them to look at it.  People who work with the young unemployed said that to me.  When they suddenly got a letter about education it set them thinking in that direction.  A targeted mailshot might work again.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">I come in here every month and tell Deputies that I am more than willing to take on ideas because it is such a difficult area and we all want to do something.  However, I do not always get these suggestions.  When I do get them, I try to take them on board.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_55">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_121">Time does not permit me to go through the various suggestions that I have received from constituents and from groups working in this area.  There are six or seven things that could be done and which would not result in a huge cost to the Exchequer, but which would open the scheme up to more people.  These people are going to be drawing the dole anyway.  People may have received a postgraduate qualification 15 years ago and these qualifications are now fairly irrelevant to the demands of the job market.  It makes sense for those people to go back and retrain, but they are precluded from availing of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs should take a look at this in the next few weeks and the Department should participate in a round-table discussion on it and take on board some of its suggestions.  I would welcome the Minister's support for that idea.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I have been looking at a number of issues, such as the problems encountered by people who qualified a long time ago and whose postgraduate qualifications are no longer relevant to the current market.  We need to have a focus on any solutions to these problems, and we could do that in the context of the smart economy.  We should be targeting support for people who are doing courses that might ultimately lead to employment, rather than some of the other courses.  At the same time, we also have to ensure that we continue to support other people on social welfare payments, such as lone parents and people on disability benefit, to ensure that the back to education allowance facilitates them as well.</p>

         the amount of fraud control savings achieved in 2009; if she is satisfied with the savings achieved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_127">Welfare fraud is theft.  It is a serious crime and the Department is doing everything it can to prevent and detect fraud, and to crack down on those who abuse the system.  Several initiatives were introduced or enhanced last year to target controls more effectively in schemes. These included more frequent mailshots to identify people who have left the country and who are no longer entitled to a payment; additional data matches with other agencies to identify welfare customers who had failed to disclose relevant information to the Department, such as earnings and compensation claims; improved internal data matching procedures to ensure that relevant information available in one area of the Department is applied to all schemes; and increased emphasis in the border regions on control of claims from applicants with a previous address in Northern Ireland.  These were additional to the improved controls introduced in 2008, which included requiring new claimants of jobseekers payments to collect their money in person at the post office rather than having it paid straight into their bank account.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">Greater emphasis was also placed last year on prevention of fraud and error at the claim application stage.  While this is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing unwarranted welfare expenditure, it should be noted that savings achieved in this way are not included in the published figures for control savings.  For 2009, the Department set a target of reviewing almost 620,000 individual welfare claims.  Over 750,000 reviews were carried out last year, which is 20% more than the annual target.  The total fraud and error savings recorded for the year was approximately €484 million, which is an increase of €8 million on the 2008 figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">In considering the level of savings recorded in 2009, it is important to note that the final average live register figure for the year, at 395,500, was significantly lower than the 440,000 that had been predicted when the annual target was set.  While it is difficult to identify exactly why the above target number of reviews did not generate higher savings, it may be partially due to decreased opportunities for people to work and claim.  Increased emphasis on preventing unwarranted claims at the initial application stage may also have led to a reduction in the number of claims stopped after they had gone into payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">Additional information not recorded on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">It is also worth noting that the 2009 control savings from several schemes were ahead of target.  These include family income supplement, carers, illness payments and State pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">Overall, I am satisfied that the enhanced controls introduced in recent years are helping to reduce the potential for fraud and errors in welfare payments.  I also believe that the new anti-fraud powers included in the Social Welfare Bill are a clear demonstration of this Government's determination to do everything that it can to stop people getting money to which they are not entitled.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">The savings made by the Minister were far short of the target she had set, and this is clear from her reply.  The same pertained to 2008.  She has set a much lower target for 2010.  Is that because she has failed to reach her targets for the last two years?</p>
            <p eId="para_134">What else does the Minister plan to do?  She has asked for useful suggestions.  The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, through Deputy Shortall, suggested rolling out a national identification card, something to which the Government has committed itself.  When are we likely to see that?</p>
            <p eId="para_135">The Minister will be aware of a case that went to court a couple of weeks ago.  The gentleman involved collected somebody else's payment in the same post office as his own for 14 or 15 years.  How did that happen?  The clear answer is that there was no ID card and there was no requirement for a check to be made on that gentleman.  People in the Dublin region have told me that they have gone to social welfare offices and have not been asked for identification.  There is nothing to prevent people from collecting someone else's payment.  When will a tougher, stricter approach be introduced?  We have heard a great deal of talk but it has not been matched by action on the ground.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_136">One of the reasons the target was not met was that the number on the live register did not reach the anticipated level.  It is important that we stop people receiving payment before fraud occurs.  This issue is being given careful attention.  The control target for next year is €533 million.  The Department hopes and expects to achieve this target through the range of measures it has implemented and new initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">Money was provided in the budget for the roll-out of a PPS card, which will commence this year.  This measure will help eliminate fraud as the new card will feature a photograph.  While it will not be an identity card, it will be helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">I do not wish to discuss individual cases but it is extraordinary that the person to whom the Deputy referred was able to continue with the fraud for so long.  An individual can, however, collect a pension for an older person if he or she is the designated agent.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">Deputy Shortall makes a fair point.  At that time, the systems did not talk to each other.  As a result of new information technology, deaths are automatically notified to the Department.  This did not occur at the time of the case to which the Deputies refer.  One should not underestimate the fact that the systems talk to each other.  While it may be odd that is only taking place now, at least it is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">Data matching with other groups and organisations is also helping to crack down on fraud.  I have twice met representatives of postmasters who have been very helpful.

        <b>Deputy Olwyn Enright</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         if she is satisfied that her Department can adequately target low income families who have had their child benefit cut by increasing the qualified child increase and the family income supplement; her views on whether increasing the qualified child increase and the family income supplement creates poverty traps and fails to target the most vulnerable; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_153">Between 2000 and 2009, overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just €638 million to approximately €2.5 billion per annum.  The Government is proud to have been able to deliver such significant increases in payments to families when the resources were available.  However, with tax revenues having fallen dramatically, we cannot afford to maintain spending at this level.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The Government is conscious that the payment can be an important source of income for all families.  For this reason, we decided against withdrawing child benefit completely from any family.  We also decided against taxing the benefit.  Apart from the significant administrative complexities that taxation would have involved, it would be unfair to take up to 20% of child benefit from families on the lower tax rate and up to 41% from those on the higher rate who do not have very large incomes.  It was fairer to reduce the child benefit rates across the board, while fully protecting up to 420,000 children in families who are dependent on social welfare or in low income employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">Families with children who are dependent on social welfare will be fully compensated for the reduction by receiving an extra €3.80 per child per week in the value of the qualified child increase paid with the principal payment.  Families who currently receive a half-rate qualified child increase because they have other household income and are not, therefore, totally dependent on welfare will receive an extra €1.90 per child per week.  The family income supplement income thresholds have also been increased to compensate low income working families for the cuts in child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">I am fully satisfied that these improvements to the qualified child increase and family income supplement will effectively target the needs of low income families.  I am also satisfied that measures are in place to address potential poverty traps.  For example, to ease the transition from welfare into work people who have been in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, with a full-rate qualified child increase, for at least 12 months can generally keep the qualified child increase for 13 weeks if they take up work that is expected to last at least four weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">The family income supplement is also arranged in such a way as to enable people to increase their earnings while maintaining some support.  For example, a family with four children can have a net income from employment of up to €820 a week and still receive a family income supplement.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_158">I do not know if the Minister is aware of a number of studies done on poverty traps in the social welfare system in 2005 and 2006.  The Government has not introduced any changes which have had a positive impact by reducing these traps.  The most recent budget was especially negative in terms of disincentivising people to work.  I received a call from a gentleman yesterday who, having been offered a job with a salary of €22,000 per annum, decided it was not worthwhile to accept the offer because he would be better off on social welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">On the qualified child increase, Government policy for the past 15 years has been that increasing this benefit creates a poverty trap.  What poverty proofing did the Department do to ensure that the decision in the budget to change child benefit did not create a further poverty trap?  The changes in the qualified child increase and family income support create a disincentive to return to work as people who enter employment will lose these benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">A person earning €22,000 per annum would be much better off than an individual on the live register because the latter would only receive slightly more than €11,000 per annum.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_163">The Deputy and I probably agree that we do not want a circumstance to arise in which people believe they are better off on social welfare.  However, a person earning the figure cited by the Deputy would not be financially better off on social welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">In all of our discussions on the budget, especially its social welfare aspects, the Government considered the effects it would have on individuals and families, particularly those on lower incomes who are not dependent on social welfare benefits.  This was one of the reasons I was particularly anxious not to proceed with the cuts in child benefit proposed in the McCarthy report.  Not only would such cuts have had a severe effect on people on middle incomes, but we would have created a poverty trap by compensating those on lower incomes.  The decision to cut child benefit by the lowest amount possible meant that we did not have to substantially increase the qualified child increase.  To have done so would have made it difficult for people to extricate themselves from social welfare and enter employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">At present, child benefit provides half of the support for a child in low income families whereas the figure ten years ago was 34%.  The Department continues to target child income support and families in the correct manner.  Combined, child benefit and the qualified child increase are higher than ever.  In devising difficult cuts in the budget the Government genuinely set out to protect low income families, an objective we achieved in this case.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_166">I disagree.  I can give the Minister several further examples of people who find themselves in the same position as the man offered a job earning €22,000.  Does the Minister take decisions in isolation?  Did she decide to examine the qualified child increase and family income supplement or did she examine all benefits, including rent supplement, the medical card?  I accept that medical cards are issued by a separate Department.  When people are making the decision to return to work they consider the totality of their income and do not focus solely on the potential loss of the qualified child increase.  Considering one's entire income is the sensible way to budget for one's family.  Did the Minister consider this?</p>

            <p eId="para_167">Not only did I do so in my Department but we also did it cross-departmentally in our discussions.  We were very conscious that various cuts could impact on the same people.  In discussions prior to the budget, organisations representing different groups, particularly the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, made clear that while they did not want any cuts, which can be taken as a given, where there were cuts they wanted one rather than myriad cuts.  A general cut was made in child benefit and the rates of payment of social welfare benefit——</p>

            <p eId="para_173">The Green Paper on pensions outlined the challenges facing the Irish pensions system in the years ahead, including the sustainability of the system over the longer term in light of demographic change and the adequacy of contribution levels and benefits.  The consultation process that followed publication of the Green Paper reflected the wide range of views and interests held by individuals and organisations throughout the country.  While there was no consensus on ways to respond to the challenges facing our pension system, it was clear that there were significant issues and problems that people wanted addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Since the Green Paper was published in October 2007, the economic environment has changed considerably and the Government needs to ensure that any decisions we make in the pensions area will be robust enough to withstand the challenges that will arise in the future.  We must make decisions now to ensure the adequacy of retirement incomes for this and future generations and, at the same time, develop a system that is affordable and sustainable for the State and for those who sponsor and provide pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">In the past 18 months or so the Government has taken a number of steps to respond to the immediate difficulties facing pension scheme members, particularly members of defined benefit schemes.  These include the establishment of a pensions insolvency payment scheme and a reordering of wind-up priorities so that, in any defined benefit wind-up situation, employees and former employees who have not yet retired may still receive a large proportion of their benefits.  Legislation to support these measures was passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009.  The Government has also introduced provisions to allow for more flexible restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation regarding remittance of pension contributions.  We have also protected people in receipt of the State pension by retaining the rates of pension and other social welfare payments for older people in the recent budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">The Government is aware that the wider and longer-term pensions policy issues require a comprehensive and co-ordinated response and has been considering a number of options to address the challenges facing our pension system.  Uncertainty in the economic climate has increased the complexity of the decisions we must make but it does not prevent or deter the Government from making these vitally necessary decisions.  However, it does require us to give very careful consideration, and it is precisely because the development of the national pensions framework involves decisions on such a wide range of future and complex issues that we have been spending a considerable amount of time working on it.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have indicated that we hope to be in a position to publish the framework shortly.</p>

Does the Minister have any idea when this will be published?  A piecemeal approach is being taken at present, as outlined by the Minister, in respect of PIPS and other matters addressed in the budget.  The latest step by the Department concerns farmers' spouses' pensions.  The Department allowed farmers' spouses to apply and back pay contributions if they had not paid them by the time they were 66 under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Over the past number of weeks and months——</p>

            <p eId="para_187">It is a question on pensions and I anticipated it.  There is no change in policy in respect of commercial partnerships and there is no change of budget in respect of commercial partnerships.  Approximately 1,000 people applied for partnership under the scheme by showing that they were in partnership with their spouses.  Generally, it refers to farm spouses.  Of those 1,000 people, 579 cases have been decided on the basis of whether they qualify as a partnership.  Some 508 of those were deemed to have a partnership in existence.  Of those, 268 have applied for a pension.  The rest have not reached pension age yet.  These are people who qualify for the partnership and have applied to see if they qualify for a pension.  Some 46 did not qualify because of the social insurance element.  Some 87 were told they qualified, were put into payment but then it was discovered they did not qualify.  We are talking about 87 individuals.  This occurred because of an administrative mistake by the Department and I regret that it was made.  Some 135 people out of 268 are in receipt of a pension.  These are the accurate figures.  Letters were sent by the Department last week that caused some distress to the people concerned.  I regret the administrative mistake was made.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">How was a mistake like that made when the Department worked out how much people would pay back?  People borrowed money in some instances to be in a position to apply to the Department.  The Department knowingly allowed them to do that and people thought they were entitled to the pension.  They planned accordingly and now the Department is writing to them to say that they are not allowed get it and that it was an administrative error.  If the administrative error had been made on the other side, the Minister would be acting tough to get it back.  This must be re-examined because it is extremely unfair to those who planned on the basis of information provided by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_189">There are two elements to this pension.  In the first instance, people must prove that the partnership existed and then people must qualify under social insurance contributions.  The section that determines whether a partnership existed did not communicate properly with the social insurance end.  When the partnership was found to exist and the application was approved in respect of this, it was presumed to be approved for a pension.  It was a genuine mistake and I regret that it happened.  It happened in respect of 87 people, not hundreds, but it is a serious issue for those 87 people.</p>

            <p eId="para_193">Changes to the treatment benefit scheme were announced in the 2010 budget.  From 1 January 2010, treatments available under the scheme are limited to a free optical and dental examination together with the treatments previously available under the medical appliance scheme, namely hearing aids and contact lenses required for medical reasons.  People who at 31 December 2009 were undergoing a course of treatment or who had applied for approval to commence treatment will have their applications for dental benefit processed under the rules that operated prior to 1 January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">In the period immediately after the changes were announced in the budget, there was a sharp increase in the number of inquiries from customers and from dentists on behalf of customers seeking approval for dental treatment.  From the level of correspondence received from some dentists, it was clear they were submitting bulk applications on behalf of their patients.  Claims involving many hundred customers were received from eight dental practices.  These applications were supplied in alphabetical order as if downloaded from a database.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">On checking with a number of customers, it became evident that many of them had not approached the dentist to seek treatment nor had they authorised the dental practice to submit an application on their behalf.  The dentists concerned were contacted and agreed to withdraw the inquiries and resubmit them in the proper manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">In order to avoid any repetition of the problem, a letter was issued to all dentists clarifying the procedures to be followed in submitting eligibility and approval inquiries.  These procedures include the need to ensure that the patient had given approval for the inquiry to be made and the need to provide a confirmed appointment date and contact number for each customer.  This was difficult in some cases because the customers had passed away.  It has been noted that since the letter issued, the majority of inquiries have been submitted in the correct manner.  Inquiry applications received without all the relevant information are being returned.  A number of dentists have been in contact with the Department since the issuing of the letter to advise that they submitted inquiries in error, to ask for them to be withdrawn and to advise that they will submit a revised list of inquiries in the correct manner.  It is estimated that over 150,000 eligibility inquiries for dental treatment were received in the period between budget day and 31 December last.  The inquiries in question are being processed.  It strikes me that dentists were very busy in the ten working days between budget day and the end of the year.  Priority is being given to confirming patient eligibility.  Officials will perform spot checks on inquiries to ensure that they were submitted properly and with the consent of patients.  Any breaches of the guidelines will be reported to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner for appropriate follow-up action.</p>

            <p eId="para_197">I welcome this example of vigilance on the part of the Department.  Does the Minister know how many dental practices attempted to submit lists of patients without such applications having been signed by the patients in question?  How did the Department realise that dentists seemed to be submitting patients' names without their consent?  Was the alphabetical order issue the main one in this regard?  Will any sanctions be applied in cases of this nature?  Have the applications been returned to the people in question?  Has everyone on the list been contacted by the Department to make them aware that their dentists submitted this information?</p>

            <p eId="para_198">This phenomenon came to light when applications were submitted in bulk and in alphabetical order.  In some cases, all of the forms were signed with the same signature.  That may have been erroneously done by receptionists.  When departmental officials conducted cross-checks within the system, they found that some of the customers who were anticipating getting treatment in the future were actually dead.  When some of the people on the list were telephoned on foot of those spot-checks, they said they had not been to the dentist recently.  In some cases, people who had not been to the dentist for a couple of years were on the list as having been approved for future treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_200">I mentioned in my reply that the bulk of the claims to which I refer came from eight dental practices.  In fairness to the officials in the relevant section of the Department, they copped on very quickly to what was happening and started to contact the dentists in question.  By the time they contacted the third dentist, the word had got out and he was expecting the telephone call.  Two professional groups of people — opticians and dentists — were affected by the decision that was announced on budget day.  When I met the opticians, I found they were particularly keen to retain the examination, which is the best way of identifying real problems.  As a result, the examination was retained and there has not been a word from the opticians since.  They are getting on with their work in a professional manner.  By contrast, the dentists conducted an enormous campaign, involving postcards as well as radio and television advertising.  They were well within their rights to do so.  A number of dentists are making an awful lot of money from the system.  Eligible people who properly made their appointments and submitted their applications will, of course, continue to be treated in the first few months of this year.  It is important for professional bodies like those we are discussing to realise that these cuts were made with difficulty.</p>

            <p eId="para_201">This is one of the budget cuts of which people are not yet terribly well aware.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister has changed the rules in a manner that drastically cuts the entitlements of those who have been paying into the social insurance fund for 25, 30 or 40 years.  A lot of trouble is coming down the track in this regard.  The word has not got out terribly well yet.  As people try to make appointments with dentists and opticians, they are starting to discover that the Minister has interfered with their entitlements to this extent.  I would like to ask the Minister about the specific abuses that are the subject of the question before the House.  What was the largest number of claims to be made by an individual practice during the period between budget day and the end of the year?  Does the Minister have any penalties at her disposal?  What sanctions can she impose on practices that have engaged in this kind of abuse?</p>

            <p eId="para_206">When we made decisions in advance of last month's budget, we had to ascertain how best the fund could be protected.  We do not intend to retain these changes on a permanent basis.  My aim is that they will be in place for just one year.  We have maintained the two most critical elements of this scheme.  The examination can highlight basic difficulties in addition to a myriad of much more serious diseases.  We have protected the basic scheme while changing the eligibility criteria.  We hope those changes will last just a year.  As I have said, some 150,000 names were submitted in total.  I am aware that one or two individual dentists submitted hundreds of names, which is quite significant.  I do not have the exact numbers to hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">The first sanction is that somebody can be reported to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The use of people's information without their permission is quite a serious offence.  The Department may consider the possibility of striking individual dentists from the panel, if it is felt they were deliberately trying to defraud the system.  The relevant section of the Department is trying to work through the 150,000 names to determine the degree of eligibility in each instance.  We will see if anything else comes to light as a result of that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_214">Jobseeker's allowance and farm assist are means tested payments.  In each case, social welfare inspectors interview claimants and make the inquiries necessary to ascertain their means.  Historically, self-employed people were assessed on their income in the 12 months prior to claiming, and decisions were made on that basis.  This has proved an effective measure of means during periods of relatively stable economic conditions.  However, it has always been open to each applicant to make a case showing that his or her income in the coming 12 months was likely to be reduced in light of personal or economic circumstances.  The Department's inspectors and deciding officers take account of such arguments and, in assessing means, exercise their best judgment as to the likely income such a person would receive in the 12 months following their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">In light of the changed economic environment, and recognising that the system of using past year earnings as a basis for assessing means was no longer as equitable as it had been, the Department issued a circular in May 2008 advising inspectors of the need to recognise that, in general, less work would be available in the current economic environment and, as a consequence, the income of a self-employed person may be reduced.  A further circular, on self-employment process improvements, was issued in December 2009.  It advised inspectors to deal efficiently and effectively with means tested cases that contain an element of self-employment.  Inspectors were advised that each case should be examined on its merits and that they should apply their knowledge of local conditions to arrive at a fair assessment of the income from self-employment for the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">Some 88% of farm assist claims and 93% of self-employed claims that were decided on in the period between January and December 2009, inclusive, were awarded.  If a self-employed person's situation changes after he or she has made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance or farm assist, he or she can apply to have his or her means reviewed.  In addition, if the individual is dissatisfied with the means assessed, it is open to him or her to make an appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  I appreciate the need to ensure that claimants who have been self-employed, and whose income is significantly affected by the economic downturn, receive their full entitlements in a timely manner.  I assure the House that we are doing our best to ensure that this is achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">Genuine issues arise in respect of self-employed people seeking unemployment assistance.  We took these issues on board in recognising that the income a person earned over the preceding 12 months could not reflect what he or she could earn during the following year.  This is why new circulars were issued to inspectors.  Bearing in mind some of the concerns raised by Deputy Crawford on previous occasions, a substantial new circular issued to inspectors last month to ensure, for example, they did not take sole account of previous incomes.  Accounts cannot be exclusively relied upon or considered in isolation from other factors.  The circular tells inspectors precisely what they should look for and advises them to be cognisant of the fact that employment is unavailable.  The projected net income for the succeeding 12 months should take account of the downturn and reflect diminishing trade on a proportionate basis.  We are sending the message to our offices and inspectors that there is a cohort of self-employed people who may have earned a decent income 12 months ago but cannot at present expect similar remuneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">The figures speak for themselves when I note that 88% of applications under farm assist were granted and that 93% of those who sought unemployment assistance were self-employed.

            <p eId="para_234">Arising from the changes made in the Social Welfare Act 2010 the rates of payment for both jobseeker's allowance and farm assist payments were reduced.  Accordingly, the farm assist payment of the person concerned was reduced in line with these provisions with effect from 1 January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">The person concerned applied for and was awarded farm assist with effect from 19 November 2008.  In such cases, a social welfare inspector interviews the claimant and makes such inquiries as are necessary to ascertain his or her means.  The person's means were assessed at €324 per week, derived from his spouse's income from employment and farm income.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">Where a person's situation changes after making an initial claim for farm assist, he or she can apply to have his or her means reviewed.  In addition, it is open to the individual, if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed, to make an appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">The person concerned requested a review of his means in November 2009 and a social welfare investigator duly reviewed his circumstances.  However, based on the information provided by the claimant, there was no material change in the means derived from his farming enterprise and his wife's income from employment remained unchanged.  Accordingly there was no change in his means.  He was notified of this decision and of his right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</p>
            <p eId="para_238">The Deputy will be aware that in light of the changed economic environment the basis for assessing means in cases where self-employment is involved was reviewed by my Department, which issued circulars in May 2008 and December 2009 advising inspectors and deciding officers of the changed economic circumstances and the need to recognise that, in general, claimants' self-employed income potential has reduced.  Inspectors were advised that each case should be examined on its respective merits and that they should apply their knowledge of local conditions to arrive at a fair assessment of the income from self-employment in the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_239">I appreciate the need to ensure that claimants who have farm income and whose income is significantly affected by the economic downturn receive their full and fair entitlements having regard to the legislative provisions and means test that apply.</p>

We accept that somebody might need farm assist but the household income must be considered.  This is a social issue because in the past the man was the main breadwinner but the roles have now reversed and men are being refused social welfare assistance because their household income is being earned by their spouses.</p>

Broughan — the urgent need for the Minister to fully report to the Dáil on why cutbacks of up to 30% in funding have been sanctioned in 2010 for sphere 17 and RASP programmes in Dublin 17, which provide essential community programmes including educational, health, art, drug outreach and counselling programmes and support for the local travelling community, given the appalling effect these cutbacks will have on the local north Coolock communities and to ask the Minister to indicate whether the Government is planning to end completely funding for these vital programmes in 2011 and if he will make a statement on the matter; (2) Deputy Joan Burton — in light of the recent acknowledgement by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that women and young girls were routinely committed by order of the courts and other mechanisms to institutions and homes run by religious orders, known as Magdalene laundries, to ask whether the Minister will make a statement and outline the position in respect of files and records held by Departments, if these files will be released and what the Minister proposes to do in respect of this matter and the proposals made by the Justice for Magdalene Group; (3) Deputy Frank Feighan — to ask the Minister for Education and Science if he will expedite the provision of the new school in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, due to the fact that the current school, Mean Scoil Fatima, has been severely damaged by fire and whether he will provide suitable accommodation in the interim for the students as a matter of urgency; (4) Deputy Pádraic McCormack — the proposals for deciding the preferred corridor for the construction of the new R336 road from Barna to Rosamhíl, County Galway; (5) Deputies Michael Creed, Olwyn Enright and Jimmy Deenihan — the pension entitlements of farm spouses; (6) Deputy Alan Shatter — the suspension of negotiations with Vietnam on a bilateral adoption agreement; (7) Deputy Martin Ferris — the ongoing difficulties faced by staff and patients at Kerry General Hospital; (8) Deputy Tom Hayes — in light of very serious problems with the N24, to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to respond to a request by South Tipperary County Council to his Department for special funding; (9) Deputy Joe Costello — the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that a national strategy be prepared to deal with the increasing crisis in the supply of drinking water; (10) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to update this House as to when he will be implementing and funding the river basin management plan for the Shannon river basin district, which he signed in October 2009; (11) Deputies Pat Breen, Joe Carey, Andrew Doyle, Paul Kehoe and Billy Timmins — the provision of additional funding to local authorities in respect of road maintenance following the recent bad weather; (12) Deputy Kieran O'Donnell — to call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to immediately implement and resource the recommendations of the mid-west jobs taskforce report, which she established, and to ask her plans for the disbursement of funds for redundant workers under the European Globalisation Fund; (13) Deputy Phil Hogan — the proposals to deal with the fallout from the severe weather crisis for communities and the allocation of financial resources to achieve the early implementation of those plans and to ask whether a statement will be made on the matter; (14) Deputy Lucinda Creighton — the urgent need for an investigation by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government into the ongoing water crisis in Dublin, and the need for emergency funding to be provided for the repair and maintenance of water infrastructure; (15) Deputy Noel J. Coonan — to raise with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, the provision of mental health services in north Tipperary and to ask the proposals his Department have made for the delivery of mental health services, both acute and community-based, following HSE proposals to close St. Michael's unit in Clonmel, which currently provides acute psychiatric services for both north and south Tipperary, and whether his Department plans to provide capital funding for proposed high dependency psychiatric units in north Tipperary; (16) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the need to regulate the sale of certain products in head shops in Ireland; (17) Deputy Mattie McGrath — the proposed transfer of acute services from St. Michael's psychiatric hospital in Clonmel to Kilkenny; and (18) Deputy Joe McHugh — the need for the Minister for Finance to disclose all new capital projects gone to tender that will begin this year across all Departments, all new capital projects gone to tender that were due to start this year across all Departments but are not now proceeding and all capital projects that are in the middle of construction at present, and to comment on the importance of such projects in getting capital flowing into banks and around the economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_245">No issue in the past 30 years has consumed the minds of the Irish public like the crisis that has arisen because of the catastrophic failure of our banking system.  It is necessary that we conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the reasons for regulatory failure, the adoption of policy positions which amounted to an endorsement of that failure and the fact that hundreds of thousands of Irish people now have to pay the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Last week I published proposals on behalf of the Fine Gael Party on the kind of inquiry we would like to see.  Under these proposals, the Oireachtas would be empowered to set out terms of reference for the collection of information necessary for an inquiry which would not cross the boundaries of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the fraud squad.  I am aware that the Labour Party has separately published a broadly similar set of proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I reject the line that the Government has suddenly changed its position from opposing an inquiry to advocating an inquiry of sorts.  I also reject the claim that the banking crisis was not caused in part by policy failures and lax regulatory reform while the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  I do not accept the proposals published by the Government in response to the Labour Party Private Members' Motion for a number of reasons.  First, the Government would commission the initial reports, the terms of which make no mention whatsoever of the responsibility and role of Government in the policy decisions which led in part to this crisis.  Second, the establishment of the kind of commission being proposed by the Government would amount to a secretive whitewash, which is not in the interest of transparency or public accountability.  Third, what the Taoiseach proposes would relegate the Oireachtas to a sideline position of no importance or centrality other than to be briefed by the Governor of the Central Bank and the regulator and to have reports laid before it which it would be invited to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">This proposal looks like a whitewash, a secretive concoction put together by Government.  I contend that the Taoiseach, as leader of his party, is afraid to have the type of inquiry that the public wants, not in the interests of any individual but because of the ineffective regulatory reforms and lax approach the Government adopted and the policy positions driven principally by the Taoiseach in his former position as Minister for Finance, which put the economic ship of State on the rocks.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">The only type of inquiry that will be fruitful, beneficial, transparent, accountable and that will be seen to work is one that has cross-party support in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I challenge the Taoiseach as Head of Government, if he is serious about sorting these matters out in such a way that the system will then be watertight and the same problems cannot recur, to leave aside his current proposal and to work with the Opposition parties to put in place an inquiry that will deal with these matters without crossing the lines of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or the fraud squad but in an effective manner such as the Oireachtas has proved in the past can be done.  There must be that type of effective investigation into the regulatory and policy failures that occurred, and all those internal and external audit situations, in the public interest.  It is important for our personal security, our international reputation and to ensure we have a functioning banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Will the Taoiseach work with the Opposition parties to establish, by agreement, an Oireachtas committee with the capacity to deal with these matters in the way we know it can be done?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_253">I reject Deputy's Kenny's political assertions on a whole range of fronts in respect of these matters.  First, the Government has always said it will give careful consideration to this issue and that it requires such careful consideration.  That is why we have come forward with our proposal.  Second, we do not wish to cut across existing investigations, whether of a criminal or regulatory nature.  Third, we wish to ensure that the Government, the Central Bank and an independent expert of stature will look at all aspects of this issue, including the background to and causes of the current banking and financial crisis.  The documents arising from that process will be published and the Oireachtas will have hearings into those reports.  Moreover, in consultation with the Oireachtas, we will agree specific terms of reference arising out of those recommendations from eminent persons whose integrity will not be questioned by anybody in the House.  That will enable a commission of investigation to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Far from what has been suggested by Deputy Kenny, this is a tried and tested mode of investigation that has brought results in the public interest in other matters and can also do so in this case.  Once that publication has been brought forward, the Oireachtas or the appropriate committee may have further hearings on it.  That is the view of the Government as to how we should proceed.  We will put in place a timely, cost effective, proven procedure in order to ascertain the facts of the situation and the background to and causes of what has occurred and to learn whatever lessons are to be learned for the future as a result of that expertise being available to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">There is no mention in the Government's publication of further hearings.  It refers to the Oireachtas being briefed and reports being laid before the Houses for their consideration.  In the public mind, the Government's publication is the response of insiders for insiders designed to protect insiders.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_257">That is not the way it should be.  The situation that has blown up in the faces of hundreds and thousands of people arises in the context of a situation where we were told on many occasions that our banks were the best capitalised in the world.  Yet a High Court judge said yesterday he was astonished at the laxity of approval of loans including one for €550 million.  As leader of the Opposition, I attended, with party colleagues, a briefing by representatives of Anglo Irish Bank in November 2008 where we were given so-called facts that were completely and utterly untrue in respect of the work being carried out by that bank.  When I asked whether there was anything else we should know about the bank, I was told there was not.  Three weeks later serious revelations began to unfold.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The Fianna Fáil Party is being branded in the public perception as having been involved in some type of secret deal because of a fear of the truth that will emerge in respect of the regulatory and policy failures that occurred, many of which were conducted in the course of the tenure in government of the Taoiseach's party.  If the Taoiseach is interested in rectifying that he should look to the inquiry conducted by the late Jim Mitchell in regard to DIRT.  That committee worked on the basis of findings from the then Comptroller and Auditor General and did its work in a timely fashion and with great cost effectiveness.  This House should not be sidelined to irrelevancy by a Government publication that says it can only talk about issues long after they have been considered by a commission of investigation set up by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">The Taoiseach was involved in making policy decisions that in part have resulted in so many people facing negative equity, unable to pay their mortgages and being completely screwed by the banks when they seek credit.  The Taoiseach must insist, in everybody's interest, that our Parliament may inquire with proper accountability, transparency and effectiveness into the regulatory and policy failures which led to the current situation.  That is extremely important.  What the Taoiseach has done, however, is to condemn himself to being perceived as secretive, operating behind closed doors and whitewashing the truth so that the public will never discover it.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">That approach has been deemed by the public to be a self-protection racket.  The Taoiseach should not be afraid of the truth.  He has said on many occasions that he stands over every decision he has made.  Now is the time to prove it by working with the Opposition parties to establish an inquiry that is open, accountable and transparent and which will deliver in the public interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">Deputy Kenny has just displayed his incapacity to look objectively at any aspect of this issue.  We need people with expertise who will objectively assemble the facts and on the basis of those facts enable the Oireachtas to deal with them and to come forward with whatever recommendations they wish based on whatever proceedings are proposed in the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  That is what needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">In regard to the Deputy's attack on me, I have no problem with co-operating with an inquiry.  Every Member of this House will assist in whatever way he or she is required to do in looking at the background to and causes of the banking crisis.  I am no exception and I will willingly and fully co-operate in that respect.  The point I have made is that the Government has decided, in the interests of not cutting across existing investigations, to utilise a proven means of investigation.  Only last December the Deputy stood in this Chamber praising the commission of investigation procedure in terms of how it did its work on another important matter of public interest.  That commission was able to uncover problems that were hidden in this society for decades.  There is the capacity under that system to appoint people of expert ability to deal with these matters.  All the documents that will emerge from this process will be available for public and Oireachtas scrutiny and further consideration and work by the latter as it sees fit.  That is the way to proceed, namely, in a timely way that is cost effective and that will ensure matters will be dealt with properly and appropriately.  We will take it from there.  It is the Government's belief that that is the way we should proceed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_268">When I asked the Taoiseach just before Christmas about holding an inquiry into what happened in the banking sector he was very reluctant to agree that there should be such an inquiry.  He informed us today that he and the Government have given the matter careful consideration.  That is true.  They have given it very careful consideration.  In the face of the Labour Party motion that is before the House tonight they have come up with a cleverly designed amendment that is calculated to make this an inquiry in name only; to keep it firmly behind closed doors, to drag it out for as long as possible and to exclude political accountability.  What the Labour Party is proposing, and what the Fine Gael Party has proposed, is essentially a two-stage process, one which would involve a specialist investigation that would establish a book of evidence-type of document that would then be the subject of examination by an Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">What the Government has proposed in its amendment is not a two-stage process but one which is three, arguably four stages long, designed to drag it on for as long as possible.  I have a copy of the statement made by Senator Boyle in recent days in which we are told the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, put a few principles to the Taoiseach that the Green Party had agreed on, that the inquiry would be "public, open and have Oireachtas involvement".  I am quoting directly from Senator Boyle.  The inquiry the Taoiseach is proposing is not public, it will be held in private.  It is not open, it will be conducted behind closed doors and it will have only a minimal amount of Oireachtas involvement.  If the Minister, Deputy Gormley, thinks he has a compromise, it is one which replaces his call for a public inquiry with a concession of two private inquiries instead.  That is totally deficient.  First, it is three stages, arguably four if one includes the stage where the Governor of the Central Bank will be reporting on his own institution.  The inquiry will be dragged out.  I accept the Taoiseach has included dates for completion of each stage but if one takes the commission of investigation, for example, it will be set up in June, then one has the summer holidays.  The Taoiseach says it will report within six months.  We can safely predict that the first report from that commission of investigation will be to seek additional time.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">By the time that commission of investigation eventually reaches conclusions, we will be told, as we were in the case of the Murphy and Ryan reports, that we have to wait until persons who are named or identified in the report have seen the draft and have an opportunity to respond to it, all of which will put it safely beyond the next general election, which is where the Taoiseach wants to put it.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">In case the Taoiseach did not get it, he has amazingly excluded himself in his previous role as Minister for Finance and his Department from the inquiry.  According to the amendment the Government has produced, these reports will consider the international, social and macroeconomic environment which provided the context for the recent crisis in the banking sector.  There is no mention of the political or governmental environment, the role of the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance, namely, the Taoiseach when he was in that capacity.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_277">I wish to ask the Taoiseach specifically why the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance have been excluded from the remit of this so-called inquiry.  Why, for example, does it say that this inquiry will investigate banking up to September 2008?  What does up to September 2008 mean?  Does it mean 31 August?  If it does, does that not exclude the very month in which the Government introduced the guarantee on the banking system?  If that is only a drafting mistake, why would one in any event end it at September 2008 when several significant events happened after September 2008 which would now be outside the remit of the inquiry?  For example, the telephone call from Anglo Irish Bank staff to the Financial Regulator in October indicating that the bank was manipulating its balance sheet and that the figures they had were not real numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The amendment the Government has proposed to the Labour Party motion tonight is a dodge.  It is an attempt to replace what we in the Labour Party, Fine Gael, the public, the Governor of the Central Bank and most responsible opinion are looking for, namely, an inquiry into what happened to our banking system and for it to be conducted openly and in public.  The Government is replacing that with a privately conducted behind-closed-doors three or four stage exercise that will be dragged on until the Government gets to the other side of a general election.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">Again, I reject the contentions made by Deputy Gilmore.  First, on the question of the holding of an inquiry, I said it did require careful consideration.  Absolutely.  Issues require to be urgently dealt with by Government in the coming weeks and months on the restructuring of the banking system, the transfer of assets to NAMA, and the need to ensure that the recovery and stabilisation we are seeking to achieve in the financial industry is underpinned not undermined.  That is the first point.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The second point is a two-stage process.  I reject Deputy Gilmore's contention that it is our intention to have the inquiry continue for a long time.  We have indicated the timelines we have in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">The benefit of the commission of investigation approach is that it provides tribunal-like powers without tribunal-like costs and tribunal-like timespans, which is what the public and everyone in this House is interested in.  Deputy Gilmore quoted the Governor of the Central Bank.  He indicated at the time that what we want to do is put the finger on any processes and structures in our entire system that contributed to this, namely, the background and causes to the financial problems we have.  That is what we are seeking to do.  Since then we have been involved in taking decisions, all of which have been opposed, with the exception of the guarantee which was supported by Fine Gael, a guarantee which obtained state aid approval from the European Union, precisely because and for the sole reason that it was necessary to avoid what it said would be a meltdown of the financial markets in this country.  That is what the European Commission said.  That is how necessary it was, although it was opposed by Deputy Gilmore at the time.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_286">Those decisions that have been taken by Government have been democratically debated in this House, have been legislated upon and are part of the recovery we are seeking to achieve not only in the financial area but for the economy as a whole.  More urgent work needs to be done on that issue in the future weeks and months, which the Government is committed to doing, as the Minister for Finance has set out over the Christmas period.  That will be done, but in the meantime an exercise will take place which will be carried out by the Governor of the Central Bank, a person whose appointment was welcomed by all and sundry, rightly so given his reputation, who was not involved in any past activities or policies in the banks.  I presume people will accept he is in a position to draw up a report as set out in the Government motion.  There will also be an independent expert of international repute who could also consider the broader issues in the banking system itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">When it comes to those reports being made available publicly and debated in the House or elsewhere within the Houses, the terms of reference for a commission of investigation would be drawn up on the basis of consulting with the Oireachtas and also drawing on the conclusions of two people in whom we have full confidence regarding their integrity and objectivity in this matter.  The terms of reference for the commission of investigation are not predetermined at this point precisely because a two-stage process needs to take place.  It is for all of those reasons that the Government is anxious to ensure we address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I accept there is a need for an investigation into those matters.  It must be carried out objectively and in a timely way with the required expertise.  It will involve the Oireachtas at all stages in terms of meeting with the Governor of the Central Bank and the independent expert at the outset of their work to be briefed on the Oireachtas's priorities for investigation.  An Oireachtas committee will be given the task of considering the findings of the reports when they are concluded.  The terms of reference of the commission will be informed following consultation with the Oireachtas.  The report of the commission of investigation will be laid before the Oireachtas for its further consideration and action by an appropriate Oireachtas committee if it so wishes.  That is where the Oireachtas is getting involved once the facts have been assembled.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Their time is going to be taken up dealing with these various three stages now rather than having them conducted in public.  The Taoiseach has given us no explanation as to why this should be done in private rather than in public.  He has cited the precedent of the commissions of investigation leading to the Ryan report and the Murphy report.  Those were appropriate commissions of investigation dealing with sensitive matters involving individuals.  That is what the commissions of investigation legislation was about; for example, if somebody was assaulted or injured in a Garda station, that is the type of issue that could be investigated by a commission of investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">This is public business.  This is business that affects every single taxpayer in the country, people who will have to pay for years to come for the failings that happened in the banking system.  The public are entitled to have this inquiry conducted in public so they can draw their own conclusions and see it carried out as a public exercise.</p>

Since they arose, we had to take decisions, including emergency decisions.  They have been debated in this House and their merits or demerits, according to how people have felt democratically, have been discussed and debated.  Thankfully, the decisions have been taken because we now have a far greater degree of stability than would otherwise be the case if we did not take those decisions.  That is the situation.  When the governor first brought up these matters, we were asked to look into them and that is what we are going to do.  We are in the process.</p>

What we witnessed on yesterday's "Six One" news and the reports from all over the country require that some emergency Government funding be made available to local authorities.

          <p eId="para_356">Obviously, there is an assessment taking place of the damage done to, as all of us will be aware, the national and regional roads.  It would be important that local authorities would give priority to the surface dressing of the parts of the roads affected.  Not all roads were affected, but this situation must take priority in the context of their existing allocations rather than looking to restoration or new road developments.  Looking to this as a priority is something that local authorities will now need to consider.</p>

Does anyone know what the directly elected mayor of Dublin will do, what type of office it will be and what types of power it will have?  Will the Taoiseach encourage the Minister who is not the "Minister for Snow" to tell the rest of the House what this office entails and to supply the House with the heads of the Bill if he has prepared them?</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Does the Taoiseach have any indication as to when the heads of the Bill might be before the Government?  Apart from the fact that we do not know what the office will entail and even if the Government's proposal is a serious one with which the Government intends to go ahead, we have reached a stage involving a degree of electoral sharp practice.  Were we to have an election in June for something as important as this, we would at least need a better state of knowledge about it than we currently possess.  Once and for all, will the Taoiseach clarify whether there will be an office of a directly elected lord mayor of Dublin; will the election be in June; when will we see what the office entails; and can the House see the Bill's heads, assuming they have been prepared?</p>

I have not even got a reply from the Professor Drumm, the real Minister for Health.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and not have this abuse of the elderly who are worried about their medical cards and whether their nursing home care is being paid?

          <p eId="para_432">During the last session I and other Members raised questions about the company law consolidation and reform Bill and we were told it was not possible to indicate when the Bill would be published.  As this legislation is urgently required and has been for some time, would it be possible for the Taoiseach to indicate when it might be likely to come before the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I and other Members also asked about the collective investment schemes consolidation Bill.  The Bill was No. 46 on the Government legislation programme in the last session; it is now No. 45.  We were told that publication was expected in 2010; now it is expected in 2011.  What happened in the meantime?  What frightened the Minister and those drafting the Bill to cause them to defer it in that fashion?</p>
          <p eId="para_434">My last question pertains to the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009, which was supposed to progress in tandem with the landlord and tenant Bill.  The former has been already abandoned in the Seanad, awaiting Committee Stage.  Discussions are taking place between the various stakeholders, as the Taoiseach previously informed the House, but we do not see any evidence of progress.  Since many of the——</p>

          <p eId="para_477">I commiserate with the families of the victims in recent instances in which there has been a callous disregard for human life.  The Garda is carrying out rigorous investigations of the killings and persons have been charged with murder in respect of two of them.  I do not want to go into detail about those instances, but the Garda Commissioner has kept the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform briefed on events.  With regard to the recent tragic stabbings, the Minister has been advised that Garda investigations are well advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The Garda faces severe challenges in dealing with gangland murders.  Often, it receives no co-operation from the associates of those affected.  In some cases, persons who have been identified by the Garda as being at risk, rather than co-operating with it, seek to thwart the Garda so they can get on with their gangland activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">It was against that background last year that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, introduced a series of strong anti-gang legislative measures, of which the Deputy will be aware.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act facilitates the use as evidence in trials of material gained by secret surveillance.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act provides for trying certain crimes involving criminal gangs in the Special Criminal Court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions directs otherwise.  It introduces several new organised crime offences with maximum prison sentences of 15 years to life, such as involvement in organised crime and directing or controlling a criminal organisation.  It simplifies the procedures relating to extension of time for questioning of suspects and increases the penalties for intimidation of a witness or a juror.  The Minister is publishing a DNA Bill today, which also will prove invaluable in the fight against serious crime.  Legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is extremely robust and heavy penalties are already in place.  Last year, the Minister piloted through the Oireachtas the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which introduced a maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place from one to five years and gave the Garda extended power of search without warrant in respect of knives and offensive weapons.  Quite apart from the legislative response, the Garda has the resources available to it when dealing with this serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I acknowledge to the Deputy that this is an issue about which there is universal concern throughout our society and not only, as he will be acutely aware because of recent activities, in his own constituency.  I assure him that everything possible can and will be done to bring those who have been involved in such heinous murders to justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">First, I join Deputy Timmins in again sympathising with the Grene family.  I understand that the body of Mr. Grene has been recovered today in the United Nations headquarters building.  He was a person who was committed to public service and to helping the poor and deprived and was well regarded in the United Nations.  The Government sends its deepest sympathy to his family.  Other Irish citizens who are there at present have been involved in much good work in recent years, one of whom I know personally.  I wish them well and hope they are able to contribute positively in the present as they have done in the past.  I make the point that the Government established the rapid response corps in the aftermath of the tsunami and some personnel from that corps have gone to Haiti in recent days.  While it is a small number, the people concerned are committed and have expertise in areas that would be of assistance in the emergency which has enveloped that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Third, I will not repeat my earlier comments to Deputy Kenny regarding the response of local authority personnel when dealing with what was an extremely difficult situation over Christmas.  The emergency co-ordination unit, despite criticism from the Opposition, worked hard, co-ordinated well and ameliorated what could have been an even worse situation.</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_524">I call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to make a statement under Standing Order 43.  The Minister has ten minutes and the spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who will be called in that order, also have ten minutes.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_525">It goes without saying that the worst financial crisis this country has ever experienced requires an inquiry.  The Government fully recognises that the public is entitled to a full examination of what went wrong in the banking system.  More than that, an inquiry is needed to restore international and domestic confidence in our banks.  As a country, we must understand the origins of this crisis to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes again.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Those mistakes required the Government to introduce the bank guarantee scheme in September 2008 and to make some significant interventions since then to ensure financial stability.  These measures include the recapitalisation of our two biggest banks, namely, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, the nationalisation and recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the recent introduction of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The State has been required to pour significant and scarce resources into our banks.  As I have stated previously in this House, the banks owe a large debt of gratitude to the taxpayers of this country.  It is essential that we learn the lessons of our recent experiences as we set about the task of refashioning our banking system to meet the needs of the economy and perform its proper duty to the citizens of this country.  I welcomed the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, when he appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs just over a month ago and I made public that welcome on 4 January 2010.  The Governor stated that he expected the Oireachtas would authorise some form of inquiry to try to understand the deeper underlying causes of this crisis in order that wider lessons could be learned for the future.  The Government agrees with the views of Professor Honohan on the benefit and value of such an approach.  The Government also agrees fully with the Governor on the need to engage a broad set of expertise to examine the events of recent years and to design and implement an investigation in such a way that a deeper understanding is arrived at of the root causes of the systemic failures that led to the need for extraordinary support from the State to the domestic banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">At its meeting today, the Government approved a framework for an inquiry and for its subsequent consideration by Dáil Éireann.  The inquiry will have two stages.  First, the Government will commission immediately two separate reports.  One will be from the Governor of the Central Bank on the performance of the functions of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  A second will be from an independent "wise" man or woman with relevant expertise to conduct a preliminary investigation into the recent crisis in our banking system and to inform the future management and regulation of the sector.  These reports also will consider the international, social and macroeconomic policy environment which provided the context for the recent crisis.  I expect both reports to be completed by the end of May this year and laid before the Houses shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The second stage of the inquiry will be the establishment of a statutory commission of investigation, which will be chaired by a recognised expert or experts of high standing and reputation.  The terms of reference for this commission will be informed by the conclusions of the two preliminary reports. The aim will be for the commission to complete its work by the end of this year.  Its report will be then laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration and action by an appropriate Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">We are all aware the global international crisis has created extreme stress for the financial system worldwide.  The drying up of funding in international credit markets and the huge write-downs of securitised assets has generated a financial shock, which has resulted in the most negative economic conditions since the Second World War.  Ireland's exposure to the sharp deterioration in international financial conditions has been significantly exacerbated by practices that failed to address unrestricted credit growth in the domestic banking system.  This growth was facilitated by access to wholesale financial markets with no exchange rate risk and low interest rates and was both driven by, and facilitated, an unprecedented property boom and an unsustainable increase in property development lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The proper functioning of the banking system is critical to the economy and, therefore, must be protected by the Government.  We are not alone in this.  Governments all over the world have had to make substantial interventions to protect their banking systems.  These interventions have been difficult for all governments.  They are not popular, they are not easy to explain or understand but they are necessary.  In all the steps we have taken as a Government, our overriding objective has been to maintain a functioning banking system that will ensure a flow of credit to viable businesses and households in this economy.  Today's Government decision to commission two preliminary reports, to be followed by the establishment of the statutory commission of investigation into banking matters, will form another important step in the continuing reform of our regulatory systems and structures, as well as the internal governance of our financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">These reviews will not take place in a vacuum.  They will build on important work being done at international level.  Over recent months substantial analysis of the failures of the banking sector has been undertaken elsewhere.  The analysis the Government will commission will complement and build upon, for example, the European Commission's high level group on cross-border financial supervision — the de Larosière report — and the UK Financial Services Authority's Turner report.  These reports have recommended an extensive programme of reform of financial regulation at EU and international level which is being put in place.  These reforms will make a major contribution to underpinning the stability of the financial system both in Ireland and in the EU in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The commission of investigation will examine and report on the causes of the systemic failures such as corporate strategy, governance and risk management in the Irish banking sector.  The terms of reference for the statutory inquiry will be shaped by the conclusions of the two preliminary investigations and in consultation with the Oireachtas but, clearly, a number of broad themes ought to be examined thoroughly.  These include the performance of individual banks and bank directors where wrongdoing and bad and lax practices have contributed considerably to the crisis; the performance and structure of the banking system generally; the performance of the regulatory and Central Bank systems; and the response of the relevant Departments and agencies, including the linkage between the banking crisis and overall economic management.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The two preliminary reviews will prepare the ground for the formal inquiry and will ensure it is effective and efficient.  Over the next number of months, significant work needs to be completed to return our banking system to health.  We need to complete the first stage of the critical "transfer of assets" to NAMA; agree the banks' restructuring plans and their future capital requirements; and progress consolidation in the building society sector.  I remind the House that the banking system is still fragile and we are not out of the woods yet.  It is important that the work I have outlined is completed before we turn our attention to the formal inquiry we all agree must take place.  That is why the Government is proposing the multistage investigation, which will be completed by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Oireachtas will be involved at each stage of the planned inquiry process.  An appropriate Oireachtas committee — the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service seems the most relevant — will meet both the Governor and the independent expert at the outset of their work to be briefed on the members' priorities for investigation.  The two preliminary reports, when completed, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas committee will be invited to consider the findings in the reports.  The terms of reference and draft Government order to establish the statutory commission will be laid before the Oireachtas and the commission's report, when completed, will be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration by the committee.  It is open to the appropriate committee to hold public hearings on the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">There has been some reference to the DIRT inquiry as a possible model for the inquiry into the financial crisis but the investigative work in that inquiry was done by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  An Oireachtas committee cannot constitute itself into a court of judgment on private individuals and cannot make determinations on disputed issues of fact.  That is why the Government decided to adopt the commission of inquiry mechanism, which all Members will agree has done a good job in its performance to date in regard to the inquiry in the Dublin archdiocese.  It could be argued that an inquiry should ideally await the conclusion of existing criminal and regulatory investigations into wrongdoing at certain financial institutions.  I accept the public appetite for known and determined consequence for those who have engaged in wrongdoing in these institutions and these investigations may take a significant time.  However, the Government is firmly of the view that the approach I am setting out will allow these criminal and regulatory investigations to proceed without the possibility of prejudice.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The Government's agreed approach will allow for the timely completion of expert, authoritative and structured examinations of the financial crisis.  It will provide a comprehensive analysis, which will enable us to understand the origins of the crisis and help us to learn lessons which will inform our future management of the banking sector.  The framework I have outlined will be transparent and constructive and it will involve the Oireachtas at each stage.  It will be efficient and cost effective and, most of all, it will restore confidence in our banks in order that they can play their full and proper role in promoting economic recovery.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_538">I am sure I speak on behalf of all Members in welcoming the Minister back to the House.  I wish him every success in his personal challenge.  I apologise to the House for the absence of Deputy Bruton but he had undertaken to fulfil an engagement in County Cork today some time ago and he agreed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">We are having this debate arising from a realisation by the Government that there should be an inquiry into the banks, which has been driven by a public perception of a false summit between the Green Party and Fianna Fáil.  I had the doubtful privilege of launching the Edelman international trust barometer for Ireland in 2008.  It deals with trust in corporate affairs, business people and public life.  For the first time ever, political representatives were above bankers on the ladder of trust.  Bankers were trusted less than politicians arising from all the difficulties in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Banks have moved on in other countries and people are in jail.  I am conscious two inquiries are under way under the auspices of the Garda fraud squad and the Director of Corporate Enforcement but Fine Gael has made it clear, as has the Labour Party, that it is not intended that the inquiry we seek should infringe on either of these inquiries, which will result in the law taking its course.  They should proceed more quickly and where prosecutions are necessary, they should be taken with the law taking its course.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The principle has been accepted by the Government that there should be an inquiry but the difficulty is it has sidelined the Oireachtas entirely.  The Minister said the Oireachtas will be consulted and briefed by the Governor of the Central Bank.  Nobody has a difficulty with Professor Patrick Honohan but he may need an inquiry into the Central Bank because it was one of the organisations telling us for a number of years that we had the best capitalised banks in the world and everything was rosy in the garden.  Nobody would quibble with Professor Honohan's credentials or his capacity to do the job we expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The banking crisis has resulted from the biggest failures in Government, public administration and private sector governance in the history of the State.  If we are to move on from this economic disaster, the Dáil must be seen to fulfil its responsibility and to ensure accountability by those in positions of trust and responsibility.  According to the IMF, the direct losses for Irish shareholders and taxpayers from the banking crisis are likely to exceed €24 billion.  It will be many months before we know the final cost of recapitalising our broken banks and many years before we know the final bill from NAMA.  However, it is clear that a very large proportion of these costs will fall upon taxpayers who had neither a moral nor a legal responsibility for the mistakes that were made; that is why the Oireachtas should be able to step into the breach and conduct this inquiry.  People are furious because the taxpayer is being made to pay the piper for the damage that was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Shareholders in the banks certainly suffered.  Many of the big earners who managed the reckless expansion have been able to go off into the sunset with massive bonuses untouched and golden handshakes to top it off.  Their parting shot is always that nothing unlawful was done.  The indirect costs of our failed banking and regulatory system for our country are likely to be much larger in terms of the damage inflicted by the credit crunch on jobs, small business and our international reputation for economic management.  This is why the collapse in employment and the economic depression in the country have been and will continue to be far longer and deeper than those suffered by advanced economies since the Second World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Some of the causes of the Irish banking and wider economic crisis are known in broad terms.  Put together, the dangerous concentration of the banks' loan books in property, reckless loan to value ratios for first-time buyers and a banking model that became 60% reliant on foreign sources of liquidity created a toxic mix that lost the confidence of investors, depositors and the money markets following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  The banks themselves must accept responsibility for these mistakes.  The property bubble was pumped up by a drive on the part of banks for short-term profits without proper regard for the risks involved.  Consider the words uttered yesterday by a High Court judge who stated that he was astonished at the laxity and flexibility in giving out loans of €550 million merely on a letter of security.  The banks, their managers and the boards failed miserably in their responsibility to invest savings prudently and to manage risk responsibly with obviously catastrophic consequences for hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Traditionally, bankers received respect, which they earned through an austere frugality in a sphere that was always shrouded in mystery.  When I was young, bank managers were looked up to because they managed people's money.  Whether it was greed, flexibility or all following one out the gate they all went down the same road.  People in the country completely lost the run of themselves.  The austerity and mystery have been stripped back to reveal a banking system that was easily corrupted by buccaneer methods, that paid obscene bonuses for short-term profits and that had comfortable auditors and boards that offered no resistance.  Many of the bank boards did not know what was going on and could not have known what was going on because they were not in possession of the information to ask the relevant questions.  There is no appetite among the taxpayers of the country to return to that type of comfortable world.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It is clear that the lending process, corporate governance, accounting, risk management, compensation and funding practices and systems of financial institutions must be examined carefully by a bank inquiry as must accounting practices and the quality of internal and external audits.  That is where the fundamental failures occurred.  The debt-fuelled property bubble did not occur in a political or policy vacuum.  It is much too convenient for the Government to blame the financial crisis on greedy and incompetent bankers alone.  This crisis has as much been a failure of the politics of Government and public administration as it was of the private markets.  Confident that their institutions were too big to fail, bankers always had an in-built incentive to take excessive risk.  That is why it was the responsibility of the Government and its regulators to protect the economy from excessive risk-taking and speculation by banks whose failure would inevitably have systemically damaging consequences for the wider economy, and that has now happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Far from protecting economic stability and the taxpayer, those in public office — and the Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance for a number of those years — actively encouraged the debt-fuelled property bubble or did nothing to stop it.  Short-term electoral gain and not long-term prudence was the order of the day.  Toothless regulation, too many tax breaks for property speculators, developer-led land planning, inflationary fiscal policies, overt political support from the main governing party for the property development industry and the arrogant dismissal of any critic who warned of the dangers all added to this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">This is why we need a bank inquiry and why I differ from the Minister for Finance.  I genuinely believe that the committee of the Dáil should set the terms of reference for the collection, collating and scoping of information on the chronological series of events that led to the current situation.  The Dáil committee, composed of respected and experienced people would then be able to analyse and determine, supported by proper resources, the causes of those regulatory policy situations.  I state this with all of the understanding that the House and personnel within it have this capacity.  This is the difference between what the Government proposes and what the Opposition requires in terms of accountability, transparency and the stepping up to the plate by the Oireachtas to state that we can do this, as happened years ago following the provision of information by the Comptroller and Auditor General when the DIRT inquiry was conducted by Jim Mitchell.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">If we are to restore any sense of trust and capacity in politics it is imperative to have an all-party committee conduct this inquiry, as I know it can.  Supported by proper resources it would make the system watertight so the Minister can tell international banks and lending institutions, the European Central Bank and the European Commission that we have analysed what happened in our banking system, that we know the regulatory failures in the Central Bank and the regulator's office and that we have ensured that it cannot happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">We propose to have a committee of inquiry at the same time as the Central Bank and the regulator's office are to be amalgamated by law, without even finding out what were the fundamental reasons for failure.  It is partly due to politics because the same party has been in government for all of this.  However, it is also partly due to a looseness that crept in, where rolled-up interest of €60,000, €70,000, €80,000, €100,000 or €200,000 was allowed to accrue on a weekly or monthly basis and where people lost the run of themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Those being asked to pay are the ordinary taxpayers whose pensions have been wiped out, who are in negative equity and whose mortgages are unable to be paid.  They are living in distress and with the pressure of something outside their control.  It may well be that in the second or third quarter of this year the European Central Bank will raise interest rates as other European countries progress economically.  We are very much behind the curve.  I would have expected the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to step to the front and state that we can do this as an Oireachtas.  Let the committee set the terms of reference for the experts to gather the information but let the politicians deal with the issues, analyse them, make recommendations and implement them in the interests of everyone in the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_552">On behalf of the Labour Party I want to be associated with Deputy Kenny's remarks on wishing well the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I am not surprised at the terms of reference of the three-part bank inquiries that we are to have.  It follows in the great tradition of Deputy Bertie Ahern and Charlie McCreevy in that it attempts to pull the wool over the eyes of most ordinary taxpayers who have a raw hunger and desire for some explanation for the suffering they are going through, whether that is losing their jobs or pension savings or the collapse of their small business. I was talking to somebody the other day who runs a small engineering firm and who employs 80 people.  The firm is letting 40 people go now because it cannot get any access to finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The banking inquiry announced today by Fianna Fáil is a clever sidelining of the issue until the far shores of the aftermath of the next general election are reached.  I think less of Fianna Fáil for that.  As for the Green Party, much of Senator Boyle's talk in the different television and radio studios was hot air.  It would be very difficult for ordinary members of the Green Party to identify any of this as an open and transparent inquiry.  However, as far as the ordinary person on the street is concerned, this is a Government that could not get salt or grit, that has left large parts of the west of Ireland under water, and which has left many parts of the country without water for at least the past two weeks.  Why should we expect that such a Government would leap with alacrity to find out what actually went wrong with our banking system?  Why should we expect it to find out how to avoid that happening again and how to restore our international reputation for probity in finance?  At the moment, our extra borrowing costs are running to about €1 billion a year due to the premium we are paying over German bond market rates, as a result of the failures of the Irish Government and the collapse of the Irish regulatory and banking systems.  Why should this Government be particularly concerned?  What is €1 billion between friends?  Last year, the €7 billion that was pumped into Anglo Irish Bank and the two main banks was almost double what was asked for in cuts from social welfare recipients in the budget delivered before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I disagree with the references to de Larosière and Lord Turner in the UK.  Our banking failure had one unique feature that was not related to the derivatives and complex financial instruments that were underneath the global financial collapse.  We had a banking system with two banking institutions that were effectively rogue institutions, but because they were allied with the most powerful political protectors, they became a model for our two long-standing banks, whose greedy and incompetent managements those banks decided to copy.  Anglo Irish Bank was a small niche bank which supplied developers who then funded Fianna Fáil.  In that circle of self regard and in that toxic triangle lay the ruin of our system.  A small minnow, Irish Nationwide Building Society, was able to do the same thing on a micro-scale, so we only have to pick up €8 billion of its toxic debt and pump in €1 billion-€2 billion into that building society to merge it with another mutual institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Our banking crisis is home grown.  As it has a unique and important political element, it is wrong for this Government to endorse the approach it is taking.  Politicians, whether they are liked or not, are elected by the people to comment on what went wrong.  While there are administrative lapses, regulatory collapses, and actions by the boards of management and directors of banks that are utterly reprehensible and properly the subject of inquiries and potential criminal investigations, there is a political dynamic at the core of our banking failure.  The Government's motion tries to divorce the political causes of the failures that are inextricably linked to the general business and financial ruin that faces this country.  It has done itself a grave disservice, because it is only when we are able to say, post-Peter Bacon and the ruling Fianna Fáil Party, endorsed by a compliant Green Party, that we no longer support crony capitalism, that we will recover our ratings in the international bond markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Government has made a catastrophic error of judgment on Ireland's future with what it decided to lay before this House as terms of reference.  I sympathise with the Taoiseach, who feels he was landed in this alphabet soup by his two predecessors, Charlie McCreevy and Bertie Ahern, because he inherited the tax breaks and so on and there was not much he could do in four years at the Department of Finance.  That is possibly a defence that the Taoiseach can credibly put forward.  It is not a defence that ordinary people accept, but I understand that it is a narrative that might apply to his understanding of how he got here.  However, he is wrong to deny this country a proper and open bank inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Most democracies have inquiries.  If a plane crashed tomorrow in Shannon Airport or Dublin Airport, a commission of inquiry would be automatically established to find out what went wrong.  If there was a major natural disaster here, there would automatically be an inquiry.  The banking collapse is the biggest financial disaster that has hit this country since the Second World War or since the economic war and the civil war, yet we are to be denied an open and accountable inquiry in the Oireachtas.  There are open inquiries in democracies.  Dictatorships refuse to have open inquiries and go for closed inquiries and trite explanations.  The Government is not serving this country well with what it proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">A financial crisis inquiry commission was set up in the United States last week.  The appointees to the commission are former office holders who are independent and bipartisan.  The Democratic Party commissioner, Mr. Angelides, said that "we start with the belief that the financial crisis is not a past tense phenomenon."  It is not a past tense phenomenon.  The notion that the Government would stop the remit of this inquiry up to September 2008 is an outrage.  The phone calls in the autumn of 2008 which went between the Financial Regulator and people in Anglo Irish Bank were widely reported in the media.  Mr. Willie McAteer, the finance director at that bank, told the then head of the Financial Regulator, Mr. Patrick Neary, that the bank would be "managing its balance sheet", to which Mr. Neary is famously recorded as replying, "Fair play to you Willie".  This is a "fair play" bank inquiry, in which anybody who has a fondness for cuteness in Irish culture will be able to say: "Fair play to Brian and Brian.  They fixed it."  As a consequence of the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance doing this for them — foolish as they are — the bankers will repeat much of the bad behaviour that systematically led us into this mess.  They may not yet be up for bonuses and may stay their hand a little but as soon as they are out of the traps and telling their little scéalta in private with no one to ask the hard question or be awkward towards them, they will be back with the billion dollar bonuses they awarded themselves.  The shareholders of the banks of Ireland will not thank the Government because they are not taking the patient into recovery but leaving us with a banking system which will limp on and perhaps have another disaster before the year is out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_560">Before I start attacking him I, too, extend my sincere best wishes to the Minister for Finance and his family at this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Government's proposal is a whitewash before the inquiry even starts.  What we are being offered are some token clippings in the form of the proposal to have a presentation by the Governor of the Central Bank.  While Professor Honohan enjoys the respect of all Members of the House, that is not enough.  We are also offered further token gestures in the form of some level of scrutiny at the beginning of the process and the process of an Oireachtas committee.  The involvement of a committee of the House is not sufficient to get to the bottom of what transpired.  The real business will be done by a commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">A number of questions arise regarding the proposed commission.  Who will be appointed to it?  We know its members will be hand picked by the Government and will, in all likelihood, be highly sympathetic to the Government.  We are expected to believe, however, that the commission will be independent and produce a warts-and-all report.  I do not believe it will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">On the issue of cost, why not have an Oireachtas committee carry out the inquiry?  Given that this is our job, why would Members not take off their jackets, roll up our sleeves and get stuck in to producing a proper report on the events of the recent past?  There is no reason we could not do so.  An Oireachtas committee would have further advantages in that it would be efficient, cost effective and would not produce a whitewash report as it would operate on an all-party basis.  Is the reason that it might not bring in the result the Government would want published, particularly if it were to report close to an election period?</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Credit control is one of the issues an inquiry would have to address.  We know about the 120% mortgages which were provided as many Deputies are dealing with people in their constituency offices who were unfortunate enough to receive one of them.  At the time such mortgages were available, I called for a cap of the order of 90% to be placed on mortgages.  It was clear, however, that no one would listen to my proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">We know about the inappropriate lending practices in which the banks engaged.  A few months ago, a plasterer came into my office and told me that four years ago, when he was 50 years old, he secured a 20 year mortgage.  A 50 year old man in the construction sector was expected to work and pay a mortgage until he was 70 years of age.  This is but one example and Deputies will be aware of many similar cases.  Recently, for example, I asked a man who came to my office with similar difficulties how he had managed to secure such a large loan.  When I asked whether his bank had required him to produce paperwork, he replied that he was not asked either for paperwork or evidence of income.  All the lenders wanted to do was lend money and then wait and see.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">One of the critical reasons the Government has not proposed to have an inquiry carried out by an Oireachtas committee is that the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance during a substantial part of the period in question.  That is the real obstacle to an Oireachtas committee carrying out the investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The Director of Corporate Enforcement, Mr. Paul Appleby, appeared before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment this afternoon.  In response to a number of questions on Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Appleby indicated that approximately one third of his staff were involved in investigating the bank.  This is a huge waste of resources which should never have occurred in the first instance and with proper governance and correct Government policy, it would not have occurred.  It is a scandal that money is being wasted by having public servants investigate Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Mr. Appleby also stated he had no idea when his office's investigation will be complete but that it would be at least a number of months before it is even near completion.  The Garda fraud squad is also carrying out investigations at significant cost to the taxpayer.  The problem is due to downright bad policy and poor governance which are also evident in the proposal contained in the Government amendment to the motion proposed by the Labour Party on Private Members' business this evening.  The investigation proposed by the Government is a whitewash before it even starts.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">We have seen examples of how business is done in the United States.  We had, for instance, the sight of those involved in wrongdoing in Enron being marched away in handcuffs.  While it may be becoming a cliché, justice is done quickly whereas in this country it clearly depends on the scale of corruption involved.  If one robs a few cents, one will go to jail but if one robs several million euro one will not go to jail.  On the contrary, one will be given a golden handshake and a large pension into the bargain to make sure one is tucked away in comfortable surroundings for a considerable period.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Deputy Ó Caoláin reminded me of a case involving a constituent of his, a woman who swiftly ended up in prison because she was unable to repay a meagre credit union loan.  If she had worked for Anglo Irish Bank or another one of the scam banks which operated throughout the period in question, she may have been given a large loan.  We are all aware of the household names who were involved in substantial, grossly illegal transactions and are now enjoying their golden handshakes and substantial pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">It is reasonable to have expected the Green Party to have had an input into this proposal, perhaps by acting as a watchdog when the terms of reference for the inquiry were being set.  I would love to be in government with the Green Party because at every test it has proved to be a walkover.  One need only consider what it did in the case of the National Asset Management Agency.  Before the recent budget Green Party spokespersons informed us they were concerned about education.  What did the party do for classroom assistants?  As every Deputy will be aware, cutbacks are under way in this area.  What about the cutbacks inflicted on people with disabilities as a result of the Green Party assisting the Fianna Fáil Party in government in everything it does?  The party caved in again on the proposed inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Notwithstanding the position of the Green Party, my party will insist on an open and accountable inquiry which should be anchored in an all-party Oireachtas committee with proper scrutiny powers.  I commend the Labour Party on its Private Members' Bill to be tabled this evening which provides the foundation for such a process.  It is a pity that this laudable legislation is being hijacked by an amendment that does not meet any of our requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">On an issue raised by Deputy Gilmore, why will the inquiry only address the period until September 2008?  The deposit guarantee was introduced at the end of that month and Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January last year.  Why will this period be excluded from the investigation?  What is the reason for the wording of the Government amendment?  It raises substantial concerns for me and my colleagues.  I have no faith in what is offered.  It is a whitewash before it begins.  While there is still time, I invite the Minister to award the establishment of this inquiry to an Oireachtas committee charged with getting to the bottom of this carry-on.  That should ensure the dreadful policies of this Government will not be repeated.  The people of this State pay the price for those policy failures every day and perhaps their children will too, because of the debacle called NAMA.  I hope the Minister will consider turning his policies around, ensuring such committees are established and conducting open and accountable business in this House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_574">When the Governor of the Central Bank came before an Oireachtas committee and suggested there should be an inquiry into the scandal that beset the Irish banking and financial system in recent years, he reflected the widespread views of our citizens that we need to find out what caused the scandal, who caused the scandal and how we can avoid it happening again.  Anyone in this House listening to the Governor of the Central Bank agrees with what he said, as does the Government.  The simple question in this discussion is how we achieve the objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">There are several ways we could achieve the objective.  We could go down the traditional and tainted road of having a public tribunal of inquiry.  I was taken by the description used by the Minister for Finance of the inquiries as barrister fattening exercises, a comment many people will agree with.  We can choose an Oireachtas inquiry.  I have participated in several those.  We could also opt for a staged approach to this inquiry, as suggested by the Government.  I agree with the last suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The scandal requires effective and efficient examination.  With all due respect to Members of this House, this cannot be carried out by the House.  We must remember that other countries have had serious banking crises in their financial systems.  We are not the only country to have suffered this crisis but the public demands accountability as well as an efficient, effective and cost-effective inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Let us examine the model proposed to examine this via the Oireachtas, principally proposed by the Labour Party.  I was interested in the contribution made by Deputy Burton in this respect.  I was a member of the committee investigating the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We tried to establish the causes of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and tried to establish where culpability lay.  The advice to that committee again and again was that we could not make findings of culpability against anyone, nor could we ask questions about culpability in so far as it might suggest culpability.  Every time we tried to ask an individual such a question, before we could get a response, our esteemed senior counsel, Mr. Mohan, advised us that we could not ask the question because the individual could go straight to the High Court and have our inquiry shut down.  That this could happen fatally undermines the efficiency and effectiveness of an Oireachtas inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">There is another more important reason an inquiry such as that would not be effective.  Deputy Burton has formed her opinion on what she refers to as the toxic triangle between members of the Government, directors of banks and property developers.  Under the Labour Party proposal, these individuals would come before a committee of this House.  Is it credible that directors of banks would come before an Oireachtas committee where tough questions would be asked?  These tough questions should be asked but questions impugning their standing or integrity would not be allowed to stand.  Such witnesses would run straight to the High Court and the Supreme Court and 12 months later the inquiry would be mired in mud.  Members of this House know that.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">The mechanism for conducting an inquiry was passed by this House.  We recognised a way of doing that so that we could protect the constitutional rights of people and their reputations, which are strongly protected by our Constitution.  We must recognise the situation.  The commission of inquiry legislation and the report suggested by the Government provides us with a mechanism in which individuals can be cross-examined and adverse findings against those people can be laid before the House.  At that stage, when the reports are published, Members of this House can clearly point to certain people and institutions.  We can bring those institutions before the House and put it to them that the report of the independent statutory commission, under an Act enacted by the Oireachtas, has made certain findings against these people and their institutions.  As politicians and public representatives, we can make them publicly accountable on foot of that investigation.  As politicians, we could not do that if we were to start out with an Oireachtas inquiry.  That is no disrespect to anyone in this House.  I see my constituency colleague, Deputy Noonan, in the Chamber.  It has been suggested that Deputy Noonan should head this inquiry.  He would carry out a very effective and efficient inquiry but we need someone who can do so armed with a statutory report of a statutory body based on an Act of the Oireachtas making the findings that we want to make as politicians but cannot make.  Let us accept the reality we are faced with and try to create an effective mechanism by which we can tackle this problem.  The proposal of the Government is to engage international experts, including the Governor of the Central Bank and an international bank expert, to collate the material and provide it to a commission of investigation, including someone of very high standing, which can then bring in the sort of people we cannot bring into this House even though we would like to.  This method will get the questions and answers we want.  Under such a process, they can compel answers to these questions.  As Deputy Rabbitte knows from other inquiries, Members cannot do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I also had the privilege of chairing the Committee on Child Protection examining the circumstances surrounding the CC case.  We examined what lessons could be learned to ensure that such a situation would never arise again.  The same advice was available to us, namely that individuals who we may wish to question cannot be brought before an Oireachtas committee if it involves impugning their integrity.  That is the reality of the situation and we must work within that.  The Government's suggestion is an initial engagement with experts and that such experts should come before the Oireachtas so that Members can suggest the road we want to go down, the questions we want to ask and the answers we want to receive.  We can then ask for a report to be prepared on that basis and for the report to be handed to the independent statutory commission of inquiry, with all the powers such a committee has to seek the answers.  At that stage, we will have our own political and public accountability.  That is the most effective and efficient way in which it can be done.  The Labour Party has suggested that this proposal is a recipe for kicking this issue beyond the next general election.  The timeframes are set down in the Government's motion.  An initial report will be produced by the end of May and laid before the relevant Oireachtas committee.  The members of the committee will tell the experts who come before them what they want to arise from the commission of inquiry.  That commission will produce a report by the end of the year.  The process, which will take 11 months, is cost-effective and efficient.  It represents a way of getting the sorts of answers we want.  I commend to the House the Government's proposal to establish an effective and cost-effective commission to examine the banking scandal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_583">I suggest that 2008 is normally seen as the start of the international banking crisis.  The collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 is taken as the kick-off point.  When it became clear two weeks later that the Irish banking system was in dreadful trouble, leading members of the Government sat in Merrion Street all night.  The following day, the Government introduced emergency legislation to provide guarantees for the banks.  As the first Government intervention, it was the subject of a reasonable amount of support in this House.  My party accepted the Government's arguments at face value and decided, in such emergency circumstances, that the guarantee system deserved cross-party support.  The same process has since been repeated in the United States.  The main banks there have been rescued and inquiries have taken place.  Events there have progressed so rapidly that the US banks which were capitalised have repaid to the federal authorities what they were given and are now trading profitably.  When I last examined the statistics, I learned that more than 40 bankers in America were in jail.  It is clear, therefore, that we have been very tardy.  We have been very slow off the mark.  Our banking crisis started a fortnight after the US banking crisis.  The US is nearly through its crisis, while we are wondering about the establishment of an inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I think the public wants an inquiry.  These issues involve the public intimately.  Many people lost their jobs because of the banks.  Many people can no longer pay their mortgages because of the banks.  Many people have seen their living standards reduced dramatically because of the banks.  Many people are seeing their adult children heading for the airports, in order to travel to Australia and Canada with little enough hope of return, because of the banks.  There is a feeling among the people I meet, including those in my constituency, that the banks need to be seen to be held to account in public.  By getting involved in the legalities of the inquiry, rather than its primary principles, the Government has missed the point.  There is public desire to see accountability in public.  It is clear that if one wants accountability in public, it is appropriate to provide for an investigation by an Oireachtas committee, along the lines of the DIRT inquiry presided over by the late Jim Mitchell.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I fully agree that there is need for a preliminary phase of this process.  No Oireachtas committee will be effective unless it has a kind of book of evidence, in effect, on which to draw.  No court case would be effective, regardless of how eminent the barristers are, if it were not argued on the basis of a book of evidence.  The same thing applies here.  I have no problem with the proposal to provide for a preliminary stage.  It is a very good idea.  It was done in the case of the DIRT inquiry and it should be done now.  I disagree with the suggestion made by my friend and colleague, Deputy Peter Power, that some kind of legal lacuna makes it impossible for an Oireachtas committee to inquire into these events.  I do not believe that is correct.  The Supreme Court judgment on the Abbeylara case was sufficiently focused.  Nothing prohibits an Oireachtas committee from examining the policies, practices and procedures of the banks.  Rather than having some kind of witch hunt that puts heads in baskets, we should consider the banking crisis as a failure of policy, procedure and practice.  I refer to political policy, oversight policy and lending policy within the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">There is no reason an inquiry along the lines of the DIRT inquiry cannot stay on the right side of the Supreme Court judgment on the Abbeylara case.  When he was interviewed on RTE radio's "News at One" earlier today, an eminent senior counsel, Gerard Hogan, stated explicitly that he did not see any problem with such an inquiry.  That point has been reinforced by the admirable piece of work produced by Deputy Rabbitte, which deals with another key aspect of the Abbeylara judgment.  We have an adequate legal framework to allow for the kind of inquiry the public wants.  The Government is missing the point, which is that people need some kind of public catharsis.  That will not be achieved by an inquiry that is held behind closed doors, in which people tell their stories in private.  Regardless of how eminent the relevant commissioner is, the report he produces and places before the House will be one man's version of events, based on what he has heard in private.  The public will have had no participation in that process — it will not have heard the evidence and will not know why certain conclusions have been reached.  Ministers, like politicians of all parties, do not enjoy a high level of credibility at the moment.  Bankers have very low credibility.  Anything that is produced by means of hearings that take place behind closed doors will suffer from a low level of credibility too.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I will comment on two aspects of the proposal that has been made by the Government.  It is proposed that both phases of the inquiry will be required to inquire into events up to September 2008.  That is like running an inquest but excluding all the evidence that was gathered at the autopsy.  It would be best to ascertain what was happening in the banks on the famous night when certain people came into the Minister's office in Merrion Street to look for a guarantee.  The Minister received advice from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance as the banks made their case.  That file would cast more light on the causes of the banking crisis than the files on many other events would.  Anglo Irish Bank did not go down until 8 December 2008 and was not nationalised until January 2009.  Surely the events that led to the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank are extremely relevant to this inquiry, as are the events that caused the Government to decide to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Surely the justification for the recapitalisation of the banks must arise directly from the problems they faced.  How better to cast light on the problems of the Irish banking system than to look at those events, in particular?  The judgments of the judge of the commercial court, Peter Kelly, are casting huge amounts of light on, and giving us huge insights into, the lending practices of the banks.  As such matters relate to the period after September 2008, that false deadline should be removed.  The commission, like the expert who does the preliminary report, should not be told to inquire into everything that happened before 31 August 2008 but not to go any further because the Government was taking action after that date and driving on from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The second aspect of the proposal I would like to raise is a common feature of the terms of reference of other inquiries.  Many speakers have laid the charge that the Government, in effect, is excluding an inquiry into its own actions.  It has been suggested that the Government is prepared to consider the macro-economic causes of the banking crisis and the international crisis, but is not prepared to examine what the Taoiseach did when he was Minister for Finance, what the EU Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, did when he was responsible for banking regulation in Europe, or any similar events.  It is normal for a certain provision to be included in the terms of reference of tribunals of inquiry of this nature.  There are several precedents for the inclusion of a catch-all provision that ensures that as well as examining certain events, the tribunal of inquiry also examines the adequacy of the response of the Government, the Departments and the State agencies to those events.  I ask the Minister, in his reply, to give a commitment that such a provision will be included in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The adequacy of the response of the Government, Ministers, Departments and State agencies, including the regulators, would also be examined.  The Minister has not excluded this provision and, clearly, the amendments before us are not terms of reference.  The Taoiseach has given his commitment to listen to the views of a committee of the House before drafting terms of reference.  I ask the Minister to commit to including this catch-all provision so that the adequacy of his predecessors' response, as well as those of all relevant Departments including the Department of Finance, can be examined.  This would curtail any further accusations that he is attempting to evade political responsibility for these events.</p>

I commend the Minister for Finance on the proposals he has drafted for an inquiry.  I will adopt the reasoning used by the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, both of whom were very eloquent.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">If one is a pensioner who has lost a pension, a shareholder who has lost value, a taxpayer who is at a loss or a stakeholder in society who has lost money through this crisis, one is entitled to an inquiry.  As the Minister noted in his speech, there is an evident appetite for such an investigation.  The debris from this crisis lies all around us.  This morning's newspapers revealed that one developer received loans totalling €550 million without any guarantee.  No prudent bank would undertake this kind of conduct.  However, the primary reason for an inquiry is to ensure that our system never again collapses.  The Spanish philosopher, George Santayana, famously wrote: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  I do not think anybody here would wish a repeat of the problems we are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Having established the need for an inquiry, the next question to be answered is the form it should take.  It should be timely, efficient and successful in bringing forward a set of meaningful and comprehensive recommendations.  The public does not want an inquiry which turns into a slanging match between politicians nor does it want the type of procedures proposed by Deputy Burton.  It wants a proper inquiry into the past which is carried out by professionals and subjected to the scrutiny of this House so that recommendations can be made for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The motion proposed by the Labour Party is based upon a legal fallacy because it admits that the Oireachtas does not have the power to conduct an inquiry without the introduction of new legislation.  I have read the Bill drafted by Deputy Rabbitte and do not believe it meets the requirements set out by Ms Justice Susan Denham when she struck down the Abbeylara inquiry.  She made it clear that the Oireachtas does not have the explicit or implied power to make findings of fact detrimental to the reputation of persons.  While I am aware Deputy Rabbitte's Bill makes provision for potential criminal convictions, this is not sufficient to overcome the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I commend the Minister on the fabulous work he has done.  The Government amendment sets out the correct means to establish a meaningful inquiry into this most serious of matters.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_597">We must approach the matter with open minds.  This problem affects all citizens and members of every political party.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Minister for Finance outlined the most efficient and effective means of inquiring into systemic failures in the banking sector.  I hope that certain Members of the Opposition will leave their political differences at the door because the problems we must address are multifaceted and international in nature.  The claim is sometimes made that the problem is completely Irish but we have experienced a global financial crisis and many other countries are investigating failures in their own banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The Government's approach to the banking crisis has been measured and effective.  I was unsettled, although not surprised, by Deputy Burton's comments today.  Not once in this banking crisis has the Labour Party supported any Government initiative.  It opposed the bank guarantee, the recapitalisation and nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of NAMA, which will ensure credit flows to small and medium enterprises.  These initiatives were opposed simply because they were Government policies rather than on the basis of the country's best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">No bank has been given a free lunch by this Government.  At every stage, we have ensured that they paid heavily for the support they received from taxpayers and we will continue to do so.  A viable banking system is crucial in terms of supporting jobs and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Deputy Burton referred to the banking inquiry being conducted in the United States.  The conduct and composition of that inquiry has received heavy criticism.  The best way to proceed would be through an independent inquiry headed by people with the requisite knowledge and expertise.  The Governor of the Central Bank, who will conduct his own investigation of that organisation's role in this crisis, has said it is better to do things right than to do them quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The method proposed by the Government is the most efficient and cost effective way of getting to the root of the problems that have occurred in the banking system.  Everybody is aware that the DIRT inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts some years ago was based on extensive investigations already undertaken by the then Comptroller and Auditor General.  It did not happen overnight, nor should this inquiry.  The Oireachtas must base its investigations on fact and expertise provided by those who know the system and who will report to Parliament.  The Minister has ensured that the Oireachtas will be involved in every step of this process.  I commend these proposals to the House.  The Government's plan is the right way forward to deal with the problems that have occurred in the banking system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I begin by wishing the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, a full recovery.  This discussion is taking place because Professor Honohan stated at a meeting last December of the Oireachtas Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs that he wanted an Oireachtas inquiry into the banking situation.  The Minister went to great trouble to hire a person of the calibre of Professor Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank, yet rejected his first key recommendation.  Professor Honohan asked for the establishment of an Oireachtas committee but that proposal has not been granted.  It is not appropriate for the Governor of the Central Bank to conduct an investigation into his own organisation.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_607">I was at the meeting when he asked for an Oireachtas inquiry.  It is inappropriate for the Governor to carry out an investigation into an organisation for which he is responsible.  The public requires a clear and unambiguous inquiry into the banking system.  The first difficulty with the Minister's proposal is that the inquiry it envisages will be conducted in private.  Second, it is a cumbersome process, comprising a maze of outlets that will not provide accountability in terms of the political process.  It is important above all that any inquiry must be public.  Moreover, if it does not have a political dimension it will be akin to a wedding without a bride.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">One need only look to some of our European neighbours to see how matters were conducted differently there.  For example, the Spanish regulator introduced more severe capital ratios for the banks to ensure there was no reckless landing.  Why did we have a situation in this State where the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, could state in 2005 that there was no problem with the fundamentals of the economy and where no constraints were placed on the degree of lending by the banks?  What is required to restore confidence in the banking system is an inquiry that is open, transparent and fully accountable.  That can only be achieved through a public inquiry.  The public will not accept the Government's proposal, under which it will take almost a year before anything is achieved.  It could take even longer if the various sections seek an extension of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Furthermore, the Government amendment to the Labour Party's Private Members' motion suggests that September 2008 will be the cut-off point for the report of the Governor of the Central Bank and the independent review, but the Minister's speech included no reference to September.  My concern is that the inquiry will encompass events only up to 31 August 2008, thus excluding the introduction of the guarantee scheme on 29 September of that year and the statement by Mr. Patrick Neary, the former Financial Regulator, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 14 October 2008 that, in his view, all the banks were solvent.  Within a short period, however, the Minister was obliged to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  There must be an inquiry into these events of late September 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">This is a defining moment for the Minister, the Government and this House.  The Minister has nothing to be afraid of in establishing a fully accountable public inquiry if he has done nothing wrong.  Why is the Government reluctant to establish such an inquiry?  There is a view among the public that once the NAMA process is in train, the banks will close the doors behind them, with interest rates increasing and far more severe lending criteria.  The public is entitled to a public inquiry.  I accept that there must be a scoping exercise at the beginning, and the Government should proceed to consult experts and so on as was done by the then Comptroller and Auditor General in the case of the DIRT inquiry.  However, the Governor of the Central Bank should not investigate his own organisation.  After the scoping exercise, the Minister must meet the Opposition leaders to agree the make-up of an Oireachtas committee that will conduct public hearings on the basis of those initial findings.  It is only in this way that the process will have credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">However, what the Minister is putting in place is cumbersome and unwieldy and offers only a veneer of public inquiry.  In reality the investigation will be conducted in private and those who are directly responsible for getting us into this situation will not be held accountable.  For instance, how could a situation arise at Anglo Irish Bank, which was apparently of systemic importance to the economy of the State, where one individual effectively secured a stake of up to 28% by way of contracts for difference?  Did the Financial Regulator know about this?  He clearly knew about the 10% stake that was taken by the ten bold individuals, but was he aware of whether those particular shares were financed by the bank itself?  Were the margins that arose in respect of the contracts for difference financed by the bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_613">The public is entitled to know precisely what went on.  Any inquiry must ensure public accountability by the banks, the regulatory system and the Government.  The Minister said he has nothing to fear from an investigation.  I assume he wants the process to have credibility.  Members of the Green Party have called repeatedly in recent days for a public inquiry.  I will be interested to hear whether the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, agrees that what is proposed by the Minister constitutes a public inquiry that will satisfy the requirements of citizens.  People are losing their jobs and homes, and small businesses cannot obtain credit from banks.  The outgoing chief executive officer of Allied Irish Banks indicated recently before an Oireachtas committee that the bank would not use the NAMA bonds to provide low-cost credit before going on to suggest that it may or may not do so.  Yet this is one of the key points on which the Minister sold the NAMA proposal to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">If the Minister wishes to have credibility in this process we must all work together.  We cannot have a situation where the Government rams this proposal through.  That will constitute a waste of taxpayers' money because the public will not have belief in the system and its confidence in the banking system will not be restored.  The Minister has major decisions to make in this area into the future.  NAMA is to be established, whether or not we agree with it, and there is the question of further recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland and possible further injection of funds into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  How did we get to this situation whereby, to all intents and purposes, in a very short period of time the majority of our banking system could be nationalised.  That is the question the public want answered.  The only way we will get answers is in an open and transparent way.  If we need expertise in terms of an Oireachtas committee, we can bring it in.  We were elected to represent the people.  This House exists to ensure the views of the public are taken on board.  The public will accept no less than a public inquiry.  The truth will out.  It is extremely important that we find out why we have reached this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">The inquiry conducted by Judge Murphy was a public inquiry under the relevant legislation established by this House, which is a public Act of the Oireachtas.  I am a little sceptical of some of the Opposition speakers in this debate.  The real objective appears to be to continue to use the banking crisis as a political football.  That has been the consistent pattern of events in this House for 18 months, with the honourable exception of Fine Gael in regard to the giving of the original guarantee.  The steps that governments all over the world have had to take to support their banks are deeply unpopular, extraordinarily difficult to understand and explain but essential to the economic well-being of all countries.  The measures we have had to take are amenable to misrepresentation and susceptible to political mischief.  Opposition speakers naturally will not lose such opportunities, but the truth is that political circuses in this House for the next year and a half will not secure the future stability of our banking system.  It is clear that for some Opposition speakers the economy comes a poor second to this political circus and the pursuit of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">We have a duty as a Government and as Members of the Dáil to ensure that the origins of the crisis are understood, that lessons are learnt and that international and domestic confidence in the banking system is rebuilt.  A major factor in rebuilding that confidence has been the appointment of Professor Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank and Mr. Elderfield as regulator.  Let us look at what Professor Honohan actually said in his presentation at the Oireachtas committee on 15 December.  He said that the banking crisis was bigger and more complicated than one that could be accommodated by an Oireachtas inquiry.  Those were his words to the committee.  He went on the say the question would not be sufficiently answered by a judicial inquiry because one is not simply trying to find out what happened and the sequence of events.  He said we should think in terms of getting experts, including experts in economics and social science and blend them with politicians and arrive at a panel somewhat like the US congressional panels which consider particular issues on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  He said, “The crisis is not simply a question of discovering who did what and who knew what.  Uncovering the deep roots of the crisis will require expertise and broad social scientific understanding more than merely forensic skills.”</p>
          <p eId="para_680">In the presentation made by Fine Gael and Labour, naturally the entire economic problems of this country are laid at the feet of a banking crisis.  That is simply incorrect.  This country had a completely inappropriate cost structure.  That is a major reason we have had an economic crisis and that structure has been addressed in budgetary measures that have been consistently opposed by the parties opposite.  Our adjustment in those cost structures has been widely welcomed in other parts of the world and recognised as clear evidence that the Government is taking decisive action to deal with the real economic problems of this country.  The banking crisis has made a huge contribution to our difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The next issue, which was raised by Deputy Kenny, in a very fair-minded way, and by other Deputies, was the extent of Oireachtas involvement and supervision in any inquiry that will take place.  Everyone agreed that there should be a scoping exercise.  The details of the scoping exercise were announced today in the Government decision.  It is clear that there will be scope, in the context of the scoping exercise for Members of the Oireachtas to identify the issues they want scoped.  I say to Deputy Burton that I do not know what will be the reaction of various people in the context of the toxic triangle she believes existed between my party, the banking industry and the construction industry, for example.  I do not know how they will scope that element into their work.  Her comments in this House in that regard, which have been consistent for a long period, show how totally unfit she is to make judgments on this matter as part of an Oireachtas committee because it is clear that she has arrived at a pre-judgment on the very issues she invites the House to consider as part of a committee determination.  That is the fundamental difficulty about having disputed issues of fact brought before a committee such as this, in that it is clear that one either has a sharp report between a majority government and an Opposition minority or else one has chaos and confusion.  It is open to the Deputy to raise that issue in the context of the scoping exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">At the conclusion of the scoping exercise — I accept this was not made clear to the House — it is essential that an Oireachtas committee examines the documents prepared by those doing the scoping exercise, and we are open to Whips' discussions on this issue.  It is not a matter of the Government devising terms of reference for the commission of inquiry in private or in secret, or without regard to the wishes of the Oireachtas.  I would see an Oireachtas committee having a vital function in assisting in the formulation of appropriate terms of reference and with regard to where the inquiry goes at the conclusion of the scoping exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Why opt for the commission of inquiry?  We all know that if we establish a tribunal of inquiry under the 1920 Act, we might as well sign a cheque for several hundred million euro immediately on the floor of this House.  The other option, advocated by Deputy Noonan and, I assume, by Deputy Rabbitte, is to see how far this House could go in examining these matters.  However, there are severe constitutional limits, apart from the practical constraints on such an operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I conclude by noting that other questions were raised in this debate which I would like an opportunity to deal with.  I will avail of that opportunity when I make a contribution tomorrow in the context of the Labour Party motion.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_457">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_699">The motion concerns what is effectively a Dáil-based inquiry into the events that have led to the collapse of the banking system.  We have had an hour or two to consider what the Government has proposed in its amendment, which proposes "to request the Governor of the Central Bank to report to him [namely, the governor will report to himself] on the performance of the respective functions of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator in the period since the establishment of the Financial Regulator up to September 2008 having regard to the statutory powers, roles and responsibilities of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator".</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I wish to make three points in this regard.  First, I have much admiration for Professor Patrick Honohan.  I welcomed his appointment and I welcome the fact he now holds his office in the Central Bank.  However, I have a feeling this is a poisoned pill the Government is passing to Professor Honohan because I find it extremely difficult to understand how he, as the boss and chief executive of the Central Bank, can actually carry out an inquiry that involves the staff, papers and policies of the institution of which he is now the governor.  I believe the Government is seeking to put Professor Honohan in an invidious position, which is not helpful to the future proper governance of the Central Bank, and is unfair to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">If the Government has in mind a mere review which, as it were, points forward to what Professor Honohan, as governor <i> in situ</i> of the Central Bank, has in terms of thoughts about the new Central Bank-Financial Regulator legislation, that is a different issue because that is looking forward.  It is not actually carrying out any kind of a review into what happened in the Central Bank from the time there was a turf war between Charlie McCreevy, Michael McDowell and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as to who should control financial regulation in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">There is also the fact that, as the previous governor has been at pains to point out on several occasions, the Central Bank did in various reports include references to its concern about a property bubble.  However, I have heard the previous governor comment on many occasions that he was powerless to impact and influence the banks because, if one likes, there was a zeitgeist, a political system in operation here then, led by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, which said "Bubbles are good", "When I have it, spend it", and "Ramp up the property market, and help to ramp it up even further by means of tax breaks".  Therefore, to ask the governor to make any serious inquiry is, as I said, to put him in an invidious and contrary position because he would be asked to report on, or perhaps review and comment on, papers and people who are on his current staff.  I do not see how that proposal would run.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Second, the Government wants "to commission an independent review from a recognised expert or experts of high standing and reputation to conduct a preliminary investigation".  In the Bill which Deputy Rabbitte and the Labour Party have put forward to correct the default in the Abbeylara judgment and the gap or lacuna in regard to powers of Dáil committees to inquire, we have sought to address this issue by providing for a preliminary investigation.  As speakers on all sides have recalled, this was also done by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the preliminaries to the DIRT inquiry, which was a sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts but held its inquiry pre-Abbeylara.  Abbeylara in its particular circumstances drew down a decision from the courts which has cast into doubt the power of an Oireachtas committee to ask questions and to get and require reasonable answers when put in an appropriate framework.  The Labour Party, alongside this motion, has offered to the Government in a bipartisan spirit measures which will restore the proper powers of the Oireachtas to make reasonable inquiries into matters of public importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">According to the Government amendment, these two reports "will consider also the international, social and macroeconomic environment".  It almost sounds like an environmental impact statement.  That part is probably attributable to the Green Party, although it does not mean anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The Government amendment also states "that these reports shall have regard as appropriate to the de Larosière and Turner Reports".  The point about the de Larosière report is that it is designed to create a European-wide framework.  Its French author has in mind a framework which would basically provide for what one might almost call a college of regulation, via and connected to the European Central Bank, which will try to ensure that the European banking system, particularly in the euro area, would not be subject to the kind of destabilisation that was visited on central mainland European countries, although not Ireland, because the reasons for the Irish collapse are absolutely different from the reasons that banks in Germany, Switzerland and so on collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">We are being dishonest with ourselves if we do not recognise the peculiar homegrown banking collapse we have had.  Our banking collapse is like what happened in Sweden in the early 1990s and to a lesser extent in Finland, which were caused by homegrown property bubbles.  The de Larosière report is simply something to which future Irish Governments are likely to subscribe in a general sense as a reforming process, and in the context of a court of regulators or a college of regulators throughout the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The Turner report obviously arises in a particular context.  Lord Turner has been one of the principal advocates for open and accountable critiques of the financial institutions.  His personal experience comes from working for a long period in the City of London.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The point is that bankers, wonderful people and all, are serial recidivists.  If they sense any let up on the Government's part or believe the Government wishes to cosy up to them again, they will be out of the traps before one can snap one's fingers and, as we have already seen, will return to the bonus culture and Gordon Gekko's "Greed is good" and all of the other slogans that senior bankers have over their desks.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">In the United States, the people at the top of Goldman Sachs are making a profound philosophical argument to the effect that, since they have made so much money and repaid the US Treasury for the bailout and more besides, they are entitled to recommence paying bonuses, given the market in the US.  Irish banks cannot even put together a rights issue.  What shareholder who has been already ripped and stripped by them would contribute tuppence to a rights issue?  People who believe they can take comfort from what has occurred in the US should remember that the problems of the United States are different from ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I referred to a committee, just one of a number of American inquiries, that has begun its work.  That commission is bipartisan and has the power to call and order papers.  The Minister of State may have had an opportunity to listen into the Chilcot inquiry in the UK.  Its members have been empowered to seek all of the papers, without restraint and as a basis for their questions, of serving and former Ministers and Prime Ministers in order that their country can get an answer as to why they went to war.  Our equivalent question is why did our banks collapse and bring ruin to the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">This year marks the beginning of the decade in which we will celebrate the Easter rising and our first republic.  If we cannot answer questions about our greatest financial collapse, Fianna Fáil should move out as soon as possible.  There are those of us who want to see the establishment of a second republic that will have reform at its heart and will seek to defeat the corruption characterising so much of what has transpired during the past 12 years.  The Labour Party is determined to embark on this political mission to bring about sustained change as soon as a general election is held.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I wish to address the business of inquiries.  During the 1930s after the great crash, there was a major commission in the US called the Pecora Commission.  The then financial oligarchs were brought before it in open inquiry.  Startlingly, it emerged from their answers that some of the largest oligarchs paid no taxes at all.  Finance capital was structured in the US much like it has been structured in Ireland during the past 12 years, namely, people at the top had arrangements that facilitated them in paying no taxes.  Consequently, their super profits and accumulation of capital were so extraordinary that, as is usually the case in such situations, they began to believe they were more powerful than any mere democratic forum with all of its faults and weaknesses as well as its strengths.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">It is historically disappointing that Fianna Fáil has tried to dodge the bullet of an honest and open inquiry.  If we really want to give young people the hope of staying in Ireland and building their futures, we should opt for reform and openness.  No matter how wealthy people are or were, they should be invited to come forward and tell their stories.  There is nothing wrong with business failure.  It is a feature of life in business around the world.  People get up off the floor and rebuild their businesses.  However, business corruption is wrong, as is a system that distorts a country's structures, including the tax system and access to credit or finance, and favours the creation of an oligarchy as has developed in Russia.  The Government is throwing away an incredible opportunity to have a genuinely bipartisan examination of what went wrong and to face up to the situation.  For some current and former members of the Government, this would involve difficult questions because they would need to acknowledge their parts.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">On Christmas eve, I received a single sheet in an anonymous letter to which I will briefly refer in my closing remarks.  It concerns my old adversary in the finance brief, the then Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  In recent years, I had two arguments with him.  The first was about contracts for difference and what was done to make the Dublin Stock Exchange a casino in which the Quinn family sustained losses through those contracts.  This matter must be examined.  The second related to the fact that developers were constantly entering into arrangements to ensure that stamp duty could be avoided at the then rate of 9% compared with the 1% payable via a share transaction between companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The then Minister and I held long discussions about the wisdom of allowing this.  I told him that, when one has no taxation structure in a bubble, no one will benefit.  Rather, prices are encouraged to increase.  The example I chose was one with which I had become reasonably familiar, namely, the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend.  All of this is on the record of the House and committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">We need to find out about this issue.  The letter sent to me, presumably by someone in an accounting firm, related to a company called Becbay and how it wanted the arrangements hurried up to be sure of avoiding stamp duty.  Anyone who believes we can examine how the bubble was created without looking at the political complicity of Fianna Fáil, the developers and the bankers, led by Anglo Irish Bank, is fooling himself or herself.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">No.  The letter I received, a copy of which I will give to the Minister of State and which I will read into the record, was only an ordinary letter about a commoner garden bit of tax avoidance.  It only involved tax avoidance on a deal worth about €500 million and tax avoidance of approximately €48 million.  In the whole scheme of things it was not that much.  This kind of arrangement was core to why we lost the run of ourselves and why this Government ended up admiring Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Mr. Justice Peter Kelly talked yesterday about Zoe Developments and arrangements for a €500 million loan all secured on undertakings.  The Minister of State present has a legal background.  The son of a very prominent developer who has fallen on hard times wrote in <i>The</i>
                        <i>Sunday Tribune </i>at the<i> </i>weekend about how personal guarantees were what banks came to rely on towards the end even though they were meaningless.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">A developer in my constituency told me he is only liable to NAMA for approximately €75 million and therefore he is okay.  Those are not the kind of figures in which I would deal but he seemed to be able to take it on the chin.  The banks were contacting him by telephone to ramp up what he would bid and seek.  Unless that area is included in this inquiry, we will simply encourage the bankers to go off as soon as this is over and repeat exactly what they have done to the economy.  Perhaps they will be waiting for Fianna Fáil after it is ten years out of office to return to office and let them start all over again.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">In the short time available I wish to address a fundamental issue.  I speak as a political scientist; I am not a lawyer.  If at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow Members vote down the Labour Party motion and the Bill at the heart of it, they will do a terrible disservice to this Parliament.  I am in a position to know about parliament and its powers.  This is an incredibly important moment.  What we are deciding to do is a little less than what the Labour Party proposes, which it does on the basis of the history of its party founded in 1912, that chose parliament as one aspect of politics that needed to be treated with respect and that should be used in a transparent and public way.  It exercised a trust that there were was no issue that could not and should not be discussed in parliament.  My first fundamental assertion in favour of the Labour Party motion is that there should be no aspect or administration of policy that is above parliament, from which parliament should be excluded or of which it should not be the prime agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">I will go further and say, having listened carefully to what has been said, that it is not a correct interpretation of Ms Justice Denham's judgment to suggest that she said or that the Supreme Court held that the Parliament had no power to institute inquiries.  Her judgment is entirely in regard to the Abbeylara case.  It is also specifically on the issue as to whether the committee could effectively try somebody or reach a conclusion which was damaging to that person's integrity, but it did not exclude nor did it place integrity in such a position as if it could defeat policy.  What is happening here is the accepting of an under-labourer version of parliament.  As one who believes in a rugged parliament committed to transparency, to its public work and to extending and deepening democracy, I go so far as to say that if this Bill, on which Deputy Rabbitte worked and which he produced, was found unacceptable and if we had to go to the extent of having a constitutional referendum on this issue, it would be the right thing to do.  One cannot continue when a Member of Parliament, sadly and disgracefully in the case of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, describes oppositional voices and views in this Parliament, to which we are elected, as squabbles.  That was a pathetic indicator of a party that is weak on its commitment to equality and democracy, even if it is strong on the environment.  He can reply to that elsewhere and he and I can debate that elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The nub of this issue relates to the role of parliament and parliamentarians and then one turns to the role of committees.  We spent a great deal of time here recently talking about reform of the parliamentary process.  It would be ridiculous to suggest that we would spend our energies deciding whether we would meet at 9.30 a.m. or 10.30 a.m. and would not express ourselves and say that we want no obstacle to be placed in the way of a committee of inquiry.  If one considers Deputy Rabbitte's Bill and examines it in detail, one will note it respects the integrity of the individual and does not dislodge the legal process within the division of powers.  However, one could argue the case the other way.  Parliamentarians are self-inflecting a wound on themselves by taking an interpretation of the Abbeylara judgment, which is excessive and which cannot be sustained.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">This is about democracy.  If it is the view of the Minister of State that I am wrong, he should test the Bill and, if I am wrong about it, he should test it in a constitutional referendum.  Ultimately the public elects representatives and representatives must never be excluded from examining any aspect of policy, its administration or its consequences.  On another occasion I will expand on this and say that powers of this House have been given to the NRA, the HSE and elsewhere, which have effectively removed the power of accountability which representatives had.  We are the worse for that.  I will return to that issue on another occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Regarding what is involved here, what of the concerns of the public, to which all of us return and who view our proceedings?  I suggest something else.  They would like to believe that the Parliament they elect in a representative sense is capable of seeking and obtaining such expert and technical advice as is necessary to give the accountable democratic decision.  They are not saying that those in Parliament must immediately say that they are not competent and should hand sideways, as it were, to an expert opinion that for which the public have elected them.  If that is one's view, one should get out of Parliament.  We come in here and seek the expert opinions that are necessary to sustain us in an informational sense and to form a decision, but we take the decision and do not shirk from it.  Unlike the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, we take it as much as possible, as the Labour Party is committed, in public to doing, to answer the public's concerns in a fully transparent way.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The public looking on will consider something else, namely, what would restore Ireland's reputation internationally.  Is the restoration of Ireland's reputation served by the complex private structure, outlined in the Government's amendment to the motion, or is it best served by what the Labour Party proposes in regard to giving full public ventilation to all the issues?  The Labour Party would not have opposed a scoping report, as I had pointed out, to identify all the complex issues that might exist, but we are insistent on the role of parliament and we believe that we will damage ourselves irrespective of who forms the Government or the Opposition.  It is important that we do not lose strength.  Our committees are weak.  I hope that in future committees being formed will be at arm's length from Government.  A committee system in which the Government of the day retains a majority does not have a sufficient arm's length distance.  In committees in the Scandinavian system or elsewhere, not only does the government not have a monopoly on investigation of or establishing legislation, such committees have autonomy to initiate, amend and change legislation.  What we need are parliamentarians who will not say that this is too complex for them or who will not give to an unaccountable body policy decisions that they should be taking or who will say to another group when the public are concerned, as they are now on this issue, that we will have a scoping report.  That is all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Following that, there will be another wise-man and wise-woman commission which will decide on the great issues that are beyond Parliament.  However, they are not beyond the public.  I am not particularly interested in the names of the individuals involved, but I am interested in the fact that a political decision was taken to implement light-touch regulation in this country.  The Minister who did this later became a European Commissioner and went to various countries in Scandinavia to suggest they should also have light-touch regulation.  That fundamental policy decision was taken by an elected representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">As we face into this long year, the public will ask one question: is this exercise only about, as somebody put it, getting out of the storm?  Is it about restoring calm so that the reckless navigation can begin all over again?  Or is it, as the Minister remarked — I liked the remark when he made it — about establishing an entirely different culture of banking, politics and regulation?  If it is, let us hear from all sides of the House and all political parties that they are in favour of a different system entirely, and that they will oppose any covert or overt attempt to keep the old racket going — and a racket it was.  Let us also hear, in the reply to our debate, at least this much: that no individual will be protected in any way and no file will be retained from any of the investigations that are going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I am a Member of this House.  This Parliament has many defects, but the most outrageous is that tomorrow night at 8.30 p.m. it can decide, without proper analysis, that it should lose the competence to give the lead in an investigation, and lose the opportunity to strengthen its committee structure to give it the power to investigate any matter of public policy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_735">I wish to record, on behalf of the Sinn Féin Deputies, our support of the Labour Party motion and our opposition to what I can only describe as the despicable cop-out of the amendment presented by Government.  The inquiry we seek needs to examine and expose in full how the banking sector played a central role in bringing the Irish economy to its knees.  It must call to account Government Ministers and the so-called regulators who, instead of doing their duty, maintained a cosy relationship with the banks and, of course, the third element — the top bankers themselves across all institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Irish public has already poured €7 billion in recapitalisation payments into Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland; more than €50 billion will be spent on NAMA; and billions more will be required for future recapitalisation.  Yet the public still do not know exactly how or why this situation came about.  We should make no mistake about it: the figures I have cited, the true extent of which have yet to be exposed, are only part of the picture.  The real cost for individuals and families, for whole communities and sectors of our society, is not reflected in those figures.  Cutbacks, pay cuts and the 2010 budget, to name but three, are consequences of these failures — failure of Government, failure of regulation, and failure to oversee a banking sector in which business should have been conducted to the highest standards to engender the confidence of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">That is why the inquiry should be concerned predominantly with the failure of regulation and the role that Government played, as well as the conduct of the top management at the banks.  The role of external auditors must also be examined.  The inquiry must be public.  We recommend an all-party joint Oireachtas committee with outside experts brought in to help with the investigation as required.  The bulk of the work should be done in public; that is what the people have a right to and deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Why do I place both Government and the regulatory authorities over the bank executives?  I do so because I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and I have seen the failure of this Government, in a previous manifestation, to accept the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service published in 2005.  I participated directly in these deliberations, and the recommendations, if the then Government had the wherewithal and the commitment to effect real change, would have had an undoubted effect with regard to the conduct of the banking sector.  There would have been protection for whistleblowers and an increase in the maximum fine for transgressions from €5 million to €50 million.  We would have seen the continuation of the bank levy and the financial regulator would have ensured that low-income groups had access to borrowing that was equal to those more favoured in Irish society.  Much work was put into that report, with the participation of representatives of all parties.  It angers me greatly that the Government failed absolutely to grasp the nettle of the disgraceful, repeated ill conduct and bad management of the banks at the time and the subsequent failure of the so-called regulation that the Government put in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_739">In the debate immediately preceding this one, Deputy Mulcahy, on the Government side of the House, said that shareholders — people who had invested in the banks — wanted and were entitled to an inquiry.  He said that taxpayers also wanted and were entitled to an inquiry.  We all want an inquiry, but the three key words missing from Deputy Mulcahy's contribution were "open and transparent".  A closed-shop inquiry is useless.  We know what will result: absolutely nothing.  We accept that if there are sensitive pieces of evidence to be presented, for example, the committee could go into private session by agreement.  There is no question about that as applied to an Oireachtas all-party committee.  We accept fully the need for preliminary evidence to be produced, similarly to a book of evidence in a court case; that is standard practice.  Whatever our aspirations for an inquiry by a commission, we can get some indication from the Government amendment of what is likely to be established.  The first paragraph of the amendment contains the type of proclamation that is liable to appear:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_740">[The Government] commends the ongoing programme of actions being taken by the Government to restore banking stability and restructure the financial sector, including the recapitalisation of the two main banks, which will facilitate increased access to funding for SMEs and for first-time home buyers as well as offering protections for existing homeowners in arrears;</p>
          <p eId="para_741">SMEs cannot get a red cent from the banks.  We all know that from listening to their representative organisations and listening to their owners in our constituency offices and in our social spheres.  Yet we are being told the policy being implemented by the Government is excellent.  That is exactly the type of nonsense that will come back from any commission report.  We are also told about the wonderful work done in recapitalising the two main banks.  However, they will need to be recapitalised again.  Several billion euro will have to be given to each of those banks in order for them to function in any meaningful way — that is, if they are not to be nationalised by stealth.  Here we have evidence of the Government bringing nonsense before the House, in contrast to the very well crafted motion from Deputy Pat Rabbitte of the Labour Party, which I commend.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">While the Government's amendment refers to protection for homeowners, one need only read the newspaper reports on what is happening in the courts.  The continuing and growing level of repossession of people's homes is an absolute scandal.  However, the amendment would do justice to Shakespeare, John B. Keane or someone similar in respect of putting together some kind of comic effort.  It certainly bears no comparison with reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The people are demanding an open, public and transparent investigation into what went wrong.  The people and taxpayers of this State are carrying the can for serious Government misconduct bordering on fraudulent policy.  They are carrying the can for this and are likely to do so for several generations.  This is grossly unfair and is completely unacceptable.  If the Government is not listening to Members on this side of the House, I am sure it will get its answer from the public as soon as the latter has an opportunity to do so, namely, as soon as the general election is called.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">At its meeting today, the Government agreed the proposed framework set out in the amendment for an inquiry into the banking sector proposed by the Minister for Finance and for its subsequent consideration by the Dáil.  This framework envisages a cohesive two-stage approach.  The first stage will consist of two separate preliminary reports to be commissioned immediately, that is, one from the Governor of the Central Bank on the performance of the functions of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator and the second from an independent "wise" man or woman to conduct an examination into the recent crisis in our banking system to assess what lessons can be learned and to inform the future management and regulation of the sector.  Both reports will be completed by 31 May 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">These two reports will constitute detailed groundwork in preparation for the undertaking of the second phase of the Government's plan.  This will involve the establishment of a statutory commission of investigation within one month, by 30 June 2010, which will be chaired by a recognised international expert or experts of high standing and reputation.  The terms of reference for this commission will be guided and informed by the conclusions of the two preliminary reports in consultation with the Oireachtas.  It will be completed by the end of this year and will be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration and action by an appropriate Oireachtas committee.  The need to examine and learn from recent events in the banking sector is paramount.  A key part of this will be to learn lessons from these events and the Government's announcement today, in seeking two preliminary reports to be followed by a statutory commission of investigation, will form another important input into the ongoing reform of Ireland's regulatory systems and structures, as well as the internal governance of its financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">It is of course important that a retrospective look be taken at the banking sector in light of the significance of the measures that the Government has been obliged to take over the past 18 months and the substantial financial support it has proved necessary to provide to the domestic banking system to secure financial stability and which have been the subject of extensive debate in the House over the past year or more.  As Members will be aware, over the past year and a half the Government has moved decisively to ensure confidence in the financial system in Ireland by announcing a series of measures, starting with a guarantee arrangement for depositors and lenders to Irish credit institutions.  That was the first essential step on the path to stabilising the banking system in this country.  All are agreed that this is one of the key requirements for our economic recovery, which will serve the needs of the wider economy.  In the absence of a properly functioning banking system, economic recovery will be significantly delayed and the economy's medium-growth potential will not be fully realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The overall objective of the Government has been to stabilise the banking sector to ensure that Ireland is best placed to take advantage of the global economic recovery when it occurs.  Needless to say, it also must ensure that the interests of the taxpayer have been protected to the maximum extent possible.  The proper functioning of the banking system is critical to the effective performance of the economy and therefore must be safeguarded by the Government.  In this context, it is worthwhile to outline briefly the various measures that have been taken by the Government to secure this objective here.  I refer to the introduction of a bank guarantee scheme in September 2008, the €3.5 billion of recapitalisation of Ireland's two largest banks, namely, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, to assist in securing the banks' funding base and the €4 billion recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  In addition, a new code of conduct on mortgage arrears took effect on 27 February 2009 and a new code of conduct on business lending took effect on 13 March 2009.  Other measures include the announcement of the reforms of our financial regulatory structures encompassing the establishment of a single fully integrated Central Bank of Ireland to replace the current board structure of the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority with unified responsibility for both the soundness of individual institutions, as well as the stability of the financial system overall, the establishment of NAMA to strengthen the banks' balance sheets so as to considerably reduce uncertainty over bad debts and as a consequence facilitate the flow of credit on a commercial basis to the real economy, and the establishment of an independent credit review process together with a credit review system to examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs.  This review process will help the Minister to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">It should be noted that the actions being taken by this Government are taking place against the backdrop of continued widespread and significant Government supports for, and reforms of, financial services sectors in the European Union and in other developed countries.  The banking crisis has highlighted weaknesses in the financial regulatory and supervisory framework of the EU and its member states.  This EU framework remains largely nationally based, despite the creation of a European Single Market in financial services more than a decade ago and the highly significant growth in cross-border provision of financial services, as well as the emergence of large and systemically significant pan-European financial institutions.  A highly significant programme of reforms is, therefore, under way at EU level in the areas of financial supervision, prudential regulation and corporate governance, as well as crisis management.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">These EU reforms are building upon the analysis for the European Commission of the high level group on cross-border financial supervision, the so-called de Larosière report.  This and other reports, such as the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority's Turner report, have provided the impetus for the international reform which is now under way.  Ireland is a strong supporter of such international reforms, and has played, and will continue to play, its part at EU level to ensure that they are implemented swiftly and effectively.  These reports also will form a significant input into the work of the Governor and the wise person providing a detailed overview of the causes of the financial crisis internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">One must draw a link between the features that are particular to the crisis in the Irish banking system and the available international analysis and reforms that are under way.  The completion of the reviews by the Governor and independent expert, together with ongoing disclosures regarding possible malfeasance in particular institutions, will provide the basis for identifying specific issues that warrant further investigation through a statutory commission of investigation.  This statutory commission, to be established by 30 June 2010 and chaired by a recognised international expert of high standing and reputation, will be asked to pursue particular lines of investigation which will have been identified by the two preliminary reviews.  The Government is aware that the potential scope of an inquiry into the banking sector is very broad and it is essential that the inquiry maintains a clear focus on key issues and is concluded within a reasonable timeframe.  The terms of reference for the statutory inquiry will be shaped by the conclusions of the two preliminary investigations and in consultation with the Oireachtas.  There clearly are a number of broad themes that require thorough examination.  These include the performance of individual banks and bank directors where wrongdoing and lax practices have contributed considerably to the crisis, the performance and structure of the banking system generally, the performance of the regulatory and Central Bank systems and the response of the relevant Departments and agencies, including in respect of the linkage between the banking crisis and overall economic management.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">There are valid reasons for the approach that has been agreed by the Government.  Under the legislation, the commission will conduct specific parts of its investigation, for example, into the affairs of individual institutions, in private.  This will minimise the risk of interfering with the ongoing Garda and ODCE investigations.  Significant State resources are fully engaged in achieving the objectives of banking stability and restructuring of the financial sector, and these resources must continue to be devoted to the task at hand.  The approach being adopted by Government will also ensure the ongoing criminal and regulatory investigations into alleged wrongdoing, which are expected to take some time, can proceed without the possibility of prejudice.  Taking account of all these factors, the Government is proposing the multi-stage investigation to be completed by the end of the year.  This approach will lead to an expert, authoritative, robust and structured examination of the financial crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">An important priority for Government will be to ensure the Oireachtas has a central role to play in these investigations and will be involved at each stage of the process, as set out in the Government's amendment.  This envisages that an appropriate Oireachtas committee will meet both the Governor and the independent experts at the outset of their work to be briefed on the priorities of the Oireachtas for investigation; the two preliminary reports, when completed, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the appropriate Oireachtas committee will be invited to consider the findings of the reports; the terms of reference and draft Government order to establish the statutory commission of investigation will be laid before the Oireachtas; and the report of the commission of investigation, when completed, will be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration and action.  It will be open to the committee to hold public hearings on the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I refer to the social context of the financial crisis referred to in the Government amendment.  In debates about responsibility for the present state of the country, there is constant and repeated reference to the triad of bankers, developers and politicians.  Books published by columnists in the broadsheets, who are also, in many cases, broadcasters, excoriate poor decision-making and regulation and cronyism — real and alleged.  There is rarely any reference to the relentless hype in property supplements, which fuelled what has been described elsewhere as "irrational exuberance", which was the cause of many of our present problems and which, in the prevailing climate, would be difficult enough to contain or control.  It has been alleged that published guide prices were often very wide of the mark, auction results were not always faithfully reported, and headline prices could be manipulated by under-the-counter payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">As a person said to me yesterday in another context, the media drive issues and they are not just passive reflectors.  We all recall the campaign to abolish stamp duty in the autumn of 2006, running into 2007, intended to save and prolong the property boom.  Was this just sincere concern for hard-pressed home buyers or was it dictated in part by commercial self-interest?  There is much discretion about the parallel collapse of revenues and the sharp economies that news organs have experienced and have had to make.  Was, taken as a whole, the Fourth Estate more provident than others, or did it, just like others, and indeed the State itself, become badly overextended?  Were the property pages, at least for a time, an integral part of the forces driving the bubble?  Without overstating its significance relative to other bigger factors, it would be good if this were examined, if any holistic explanations were sought and lessons learned, and if improved safeguards were provided for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The preliminary reviews and the commission of investigation and their appropriate consideration by the Oireachtas, together with ongoing Garda and ODCE investigations, will form a comprehensive framework of investigation into the recent crisis in the banking sector.  This will allow the Government to assess how lessons can be learned to inform our future management of the sector, both in regard to institutions and their management and direction and in regard to the management of risks and stability issues within the regulatory and governmental systems.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_781">I support the amendment.  The debate arises from a public demand to find out what went wrong with our banking system and who is responsible for it.  The people want to ensure this does not happen again and to restore our reputation on the international financial markets in a way that does not prejudice ongoing criminal investigations.  People have lost their savings and pensions.  Businesses in my constituency cannot obtain finance from banks because the banks cannot access credit following the wipe-out of their capital as a result of unwise decisions.  People are demanding answers to these questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Everyone in the House agrees on the central objectives of an inquiry but we disagree on how we go about doing this.  The Government wants to do this efficiently, effectively and in a way that works and we disagree fundamentally with the Opposition on this.  The proposals of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, although they seek to achieve the same objective as the Government, cannot do so.  We want an inquiry that will compel those who have information and who have difficult questions to answer to come before it and to be held to account.  We want them to be subject to rigorous cross-examination.  We want an inquiry that can make findings of fact and culpability about people who were centrally involved in the financial collapse of the country.  Unfortunately, the Fine Gael and Labour Party proposals would not allow us to do that.  The Government shares their desire to meet the public demand for culpability and accountability but the only way in which we will achieve that is through the Government's three-pronged proposal to find out the questions that need to be answered, to identify the people who can answer them and then to use legislation, which the House passed, to allow an inquiry to take place where this information can be ascertained, witnesses brought forward, tough questions answered and a report made public.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">That is a tried and tested method.  We witnessed it recently in the inquiry into the Dublin archdiocese.  Nobody has questioned whether that was a cost effective, efficient inquiry that got to the heart of the matter, and there is no suggestion that the Government's proposal would do otherwise.  Unfortunately, many Deputies and members of the public are confused by a blood lust to hold an inquiry in the Dáil, which would replicate a tribunal of inquiry, discredited as such inquiries are.  The Government wants to put before the House the report of the commission of investigation with its findings of fact and culpability in order that the House can have its own day.  The people involved can be brought in on the basis of findings and allegations made against them in the report about them not doing their job or opening credit lines they should not have or making bad and imprudent credit decisions.  The Government's proposal will provide for such a report and, armed with this, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will be able to do what the people want, which is find out who is responsible, how we got to this point and how we can avoid arriving at this point again while, at the same time, ensuring people who broke the law and engaged in malpractice and misconduct and who should be brought before the courts can be still brought before them.  The only way to achieve the objectives we all share in the House is through the Government's proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Deputy Burton sought a bipartisan approach to this affair but, unfortunately, the Deputy and the Labour Party had made up their minds that there was a toxic triangle between the banks, my party and developers, an allegation I reject.  If they seek to have a bipartisan inquiry in the House having come to such a conclusion, it will go nowhere.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I also support the amendment and I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this most topical issue, which is affecting every man, woman and child and which will affect future generations. We must get answers on the failures visited upon our people.  There was a monumental failure on the part of our banking services and I must condemn our regulation services which failed miserably to regulate and honour the jobs and positions they had.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">As a public representative I believe the citizens of Ireland are entitled to know what happened, how it went wrong and what mistakes we made.  More importantly, we must try to learn from those mistakes and, together, lift our country out of the deep mire it is in at present.  We all know that not a red cent is available to any citizen whether for business, ordinary families, farming or anybody with a new idea to get the country off its knees and up and running.  We hear pious platitudes from our bankers that credit is available for mortgages, to build new houses and to kick-start the building industry and business.  However, we know the reality is that not a cent is available.  We must accept that the banks do not have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Until we sort out those issues and get proper answers I will not call for anybody to be indicted without fair and due process.  I support the procedures laid down by the Government to hold these inquiries and to do so in public where possible.  It is imperative that the public sees what is going on and it is looking to us to bring these people to account, whether they be regulators, bankers or politicians who allowed the situation to continue and got us into the mess in which we are.  It is vital for the future of the country that we have this investigation and that it is carried out speedily and effectively with the right people and expertise brought in to do so.  We must then bring it back to the Oireachtas committees, as we have done in the past.  We are dealing with a much greater challenge than any Oireachtas committee has had to deal with but it should return for debate to the floor of this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Let whomever feels the cap fits wear it, whether banker, regulator or politician.  We have to send out the message to our European partners, our international lenders and those with whom we transact business on a daily basis that Ireland does not have a kangaroo system but that it is a democracy with an effective and working banking system and thriving economy.  To do so we must learn from our mistakes and put a new roadmap in place to chart out a course and go forward and, with the help of our people, lift our economy back to where we would all like to be, not to the mad years of the Celtic tiger but to a decent day's pay for every man or woman who wants to work for a day's wages and not the crazy figures to which some people felt they were entitled and achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I lend my support to this inquiry and I hope it will be constructive, that there will be no witch hunts but that there will also be no hiding place for any man or woman who in the end-game is found to be guilty of any wrongdoing.  However, it must take place after due process is carried out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_790">I support the Government's amendment to the motion before the House.  Over the past 18 months, there has been much debate in the House on the stability of our economy and banking.  It is with satisfaction that I discuss the matter again today as our economy is stabilising and our banking system is also showing signs of doing so.  There have been many ups and downs during the past year or two and on many occasions we faced a crisis.  Each time, the Government stepped up to the mark and provided the leadership required to inject stability into the economy.  It is necessary to state that we provided the leadership to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The ordinary people have made many sacrifices to ensure we get back on our feet.  There has been much discussion in our recent past about our resilience as a nation and the concept of the Irish meitheal.  As a nation, our meitheal has been thoroughly tested in recent times.  It is against these tests that we show our true ability.  It is only when we work together that we can show optimum ability as a nation and it is with that mindset that we must move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The banking system has let us down.  People did wrong and the system failed us.  There is nobody in the country who does not want to see those responsible facing justice.  There is no justification for debate on that issue.  However, how it is investigated is certainly a matter of opinion and of those there are many.  Unfortunately, in recent months there has been much fanfare on the Opposition benches about how we will bring the country to economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I firmly believe in efficient Opposition and constructive criticism.  It is time the Labour Party got real about what the country faces and offers real alternatives or gets behind the leadership being provided by the Government.  The Government is responsible for the bank guarantee scheme against much criticism from the Labour Party.  Other countries copied our technique as they appreciated the advantages of such a scheme.  The Government was responsible for nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, not in an effort to save bankers but in an effort to save the bank itself and, more importantly, its depositors and shareholders.  These are real people whose interests we must protect.  I must also point out that it was under this Government that the Garda inquiry into the dealings in Anglo Irish Bank came about.  The recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland followed.  Again this was to bail out depositors and those seeking credit and not the bankers, as has been claimed by some.  We are not in the business of bailing out bankers; we want to get the country back on its feet and that is our common purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Clearly, the aim of the Labour Party is to destroy Ireland's banking reputation and only then it may have a chance of electoral success and a return to Government.  Only a fool could not see that the Labour Party's position throughout the banking crisis has been one of political point scoring with a view to enhancing its electoral success but with no regard to the current difficulties of depositors and banks.  It does not have an ounce of consideration for the recovery of the economy.  The Government was responsible for the establishment of NAMA and we have been heavily criticised for that.  However, I firmly believe it was the only show on the road.  I look forward to credit being freed up by the banks in the near future when they are restructured.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I could spend all my speaking time discussing the various suggestions made by the Opposition for stabilising our economy.  However, I am not interested in rehearsing what has already been debated in depth in the House.  Suffice it to say the Labour Party has been caught up in the business of opposing anything proposed by the Government.  However, time will prove that the correct measures have been taken and the roots of stability are already showing.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">We are too familiar with inquiries and tribunals and their benefits and lack thereof.  It is vital that an inquiry of sorts is launched into the failures of our banking system.  However, we must be acutely aware of issues such as time and cost.  How we go about this is the crux of the debate before us.  The proposal by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, is sensible and measured.  The Labour Party spokesperson on finance is more keen on trial by the Labour Party and letting the banks fix themselves, which has resulted in the position of the Labour Party which I already outlined.  Let us not forget that the banks need help to recover as much as we need inquiries.  It is our job as legislators and Government to provide real solutions and that is what we have been doing in the recent past.  We will continue to do so even though it may not please the Labour Party or be in its political or electoral interests.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_799">I thank the Labour Party for tabling the motion.  As a party, Fine Gael feels very strongly that there is a need for a public inquiry to be carried out by the Oireachtas.  We were elected by the people to represent them.  To restore confidence to the banking system and to bring credibility to this inquiry, it must be held in public and under the direction of an Oireachtas committee.  This is critical because it will be open, transparent and show proper accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The Government has brought forward a counter motion to the Labour Party motion.  I listened with interest to the Ministers of State, Deputies Power and Mansergh, who spoke about how this would work.  The Government is spinning that this is a public inquiry, but is like a wedding without the bride because it is completely outside the terms of reference of the Labour Party motion.  The Government motion refers to bringing forward two reports from the Governor of the Central Bank.  It is inappropriate to have a newly appointed Governor — an excellent man of great calibre — carrying out an investigation into an organisation that he has just taken over.  The motion only deals with the Financial Regulator and the running of the Central Bank, and there is no reference to Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The Government motion also refers to carrying out an independent review, but once again it only looks at Ireland's banking set up until September 2008.  The Government has not clarified whether this means up to 31 August, in which case its guarantee scheme from 29 September 2008 is omitted, as is the appearance at the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs on 14 October of Mr. Patrick Neary, the former chief executive of the Financial Regulator.  At this committee he stated "I believe that all banks are solvent."  However, Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised a short time later.  These issues would not come under the terms of the Government inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The Government motion refers to appearances before the Oireachtas committee before and after the reports are completed.  It also states that the terms of reference and a draft Government order establishing a statutory commission of investigation will follow the two reports.  Those terms of reference would appear to be at the sole discretion of the Government.  It is not allowing the Oireachtas committee to determine the terms of reference.  The motion seems to infer that the Oireachtas committee will meet and brief the Governor and the independent expert at the outset on the priorities of the Oireachtas for the investigation.  The two preliminary reports will be laid before the House and the Oireachtas will be invited to consider to findings of the report.  However, those reports will be determined ultimately by the terms of reference laid down by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The people want a public inquiry.  The Government has nothing to hide and nothing to worry about.  We in Fine Gael wish to have cross-party co-operation on this.  The Opposition leaders can meet the Taoiseach and come up with the proper terms of reference for an Oireachtas committee.  A scoping exercise can be carried out prior to any formal work done by the committee.  The Governor of the Central Bank made a clear recommendation and the Minister for Finance went to much time and trouble to ensure that he got the best possible appointment.  We all agree that Professor Honohan is an excellent appointee, yet the Government has tried to water down his first recommendation.  He stated that there should be a complete inquiry, but this is a fudge and a whitewash.  It is like water flowing through four or five funnels, with the result being that there is no water at the end.  The Government is trying to ensure that we do not have an open and transparent inquiry.  The public is entitled to nothing less.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources tried to represent this as a public inquiry.  The Green Party Members have been shouting from the rooftops over the past three or four days that they would accept nothing less than a public inquiry.  They are either not on top of their game or they are rolling over, but this is certainly not a public inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">We must look at the key issues, such as banking regulation.  Professor Honohan stated at the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs in December that one of the key reasons for the failure of the banking system was lack of regulation.  We also need to look at Government policy.  We need to look at the legislation that was brought in and why it was enacted.  The Financial Regulator only functions according to the legislation that is implemented.  We must have an open system to find out why the bulk of the banking system may soon be nationalised.  Why did we get to a position where the loan book of a major bank doubled between 2005 and 2007?  Why are we in a position where young couples have 100% mortgages that they could not afford?</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Labour Party has brought forward a Private Members' Bill on compellability.  We support it in principle, but we feel that it is possible to set up a committee without any further legislation to deal with Government regulations and policy on the banking system.  I hope that when the Minister speaks tomorrow night, he will promise to take the views of the Opposition on board, we will have a public inquiry in the Oireachtas so that the people can regain trust and that we might have confidence restored in the banking system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GeorgeLee" eId="spk_477">
          <from>Deputy George Lee</from>
          <p eId="para_807">In his speech, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh spoke about the need to examine and learn from recent event in the banking sector.  He was absolutely right and nobody would disagree with him.  However, the difficulty is that while we need to learn, we must recognise that learning about what happened is a necessary condition for fixing the banking system, but it will never be a sufficient condition.  The core of the collapse in prosperity has been a collapse in trust.  In addressing the banking problem, we do not just need to learn what went wrong; we also need to work very hard to re-establish trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The collapse in trust has led to the collapse in prosperity.  The collapse in trust caused banks not to lend to each other, wiped out the share values of those banks and caused all sorts of difficulties in obtaining working capital for businesses, resulting in a loss of jobs.  That is the real difficulty with recreating prosperity.  We should learn what went wrong, but we should not pretend for a second that this will be enough.  It is incredible that the Government is suggesting we can re-establish public trust behind closed doors.  It just cannot be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">We are being asked to accept that the Central Bank will report on itself and expect that this will restore confidence.  This simply cannot be true.  The Central Bank itself has failed, although I do not mean to impugn Professor Honohan's reputation in saying that.  He was not involved in the Central Bank at the time.  The bank failed and will now write a report on its own failure.  From a public perspective, this is obscene.  Members of the public who are picking up the tab for the failure of the banking system and the poor decisions that were made need to know the reason they are being asked to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">It is crucial to have a well informed contribution to the new form of banking regulation which is being discussed.  Members of the public need to have confidence in the regulation that will be put in place.  Unless they see questions being asked in public, there will be a lack of belief in the new system of banking regulation.  The problem is they cannot trust insiders on this matter.  The inquiry, as proposed by the Government, will be about insiders and will be conducted by insiders for the benefit of insiders.  That will not do.  It is not acceptable to conduct the inquiry in secret when the consequences of the collapse have been so public.  While a private commission may help us to establish some facts, it will not restore trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I understand from international observations made by the OECD and others that the loss to taxpayers from the banking collapse could be as much as €24 billion.  Ireland has only 1.8 million to 1.9 million people with jobs.  Last year, the net loss of young people to emigration was of the order of 60,000.  On the employment front, the cost to the public of having 420,000 people on the live register is enormous.  The proposal to conduct this inquiry in private is breathtaking in its arrogance.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The Central Bank, Financial Regulator and Government told us everything would be all right when things were not all right.  We are not trying to find out what went wrong.  We know the effect of what went wrong.  Unemployment, damage, hurt and lost prosperity are in everybody's face.  This is the reason we need this inquiry.  The difficulty we have is that the commission will produce a report which will present a <i>fait accompli</i>  to the public.  We do not know for sure that it will ask witnesses the questions we would like it to ask.  For this reason, it will be difficult to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">In terms of believing the Government has the correct approach one only has to consider the issue of fallibility.  In 2004, the current Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, outlined his view of the world in the context of his budget.  He stated he hoped ordinary taxpayers would recognise the firm resolve of the Government to secure their welfare now and for the future, adding that the "country and its future are in safe hands with this Government."  This statement turned out to be waffle.  The following year, the then Minister for Finance stated the Government would not put at risk the prosperity achieved by the Irish people, adding that prosperity could be a great gift that this generation would give to the next generation.  This, too, turned out to be guff.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">In 2006, the current Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated that the country's success had been brought about by the hard work of our people — that part was true — in response to the policies of the Government.  If he believes that, then the Government's policies are the cause of what occurred and the public needs to see the matter thrashed out in public.  The hard work, which is key to prosperity, was done by people.  They want answers and need to see them given in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">In December 2007, while the credit crisis was well in flow, the current Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated that the fundamentals of the economy were still good, adding that rather than adopting "a conservative, cautious stance, I believe we must respond to the challenge by taking determined action and pushing ahead with renewed vigour".  The Government is extraordinarily fallible and members of the public do not have confidence in or trust it.  If one examines its record in terms of everything it has done and said, there is good reason for this lack of public confidence and trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">This also applies to the Central Bank.  The bank produces a financial stability report each year.  In November 2006, only months before the outbreak of the credit crisis, it stated that house price increases "may be easing somewhat" and that if these signs were to continue into 2007, the vulnerability posed by house prices would be reduced somewhat.  This statement was rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The following year the Central Bank stated that the central expectation was that the shock absorption capacity of the banks left them well placed to withstand the pressures from any adverse economic and sectoral developments.  This was drivel.  The bank stated further that the health of the banking system remained robust.  Its analysis described as benign the changes in the workings of the banking system and the fact that it was importing money.  We cannot have the Central Bank investigate itself.  No one has any trust in the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">While the Government and Central Bank did not set out to make mistakes and wanted to do the job correctly, that they got it so wrong is the reason it is so important to have an independent report.  It is impossible to support a proposal to have the people who got it wrong report on how they got it wrong.  No one has confidence in the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Members of the public are in shock and sick of being spoken down to by people behind closed doors.  The Government proposal in its amendment to the Labour Party's Private Members' motion is to do just this.  It is not sufficient and the public deserves much better.  Trust is lacking and the Government, by failing to live up to its responsibility, has shown it cannot be trusted.  If the report is not debated in full in public, it will be an enormous error and a huge let down for the public.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_820">I thank the Labour Party for tabling the motion.  This debate offers the Government an opportunity to see sense.  A committee of inquiry operating in an open and transparent manner would be a means of confirming and acknowledging what is being said in public.  Most people seeking justice with only a small number seeking blood.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">This proposal is an opportunity to have the House fulfil its democratic role and avail of the expertise required to find out what went wrong, when it went wrong and why, before making informed decisions.  By tabling the amendment, the Government is refusing to afford members of the public a democratic opportunity to allow government to govern.  Unfortunately, the Government made bad decisions and propagated and introduced light touch regulation.  Now, however, it is preventing an opportunity to allow parliamentary democracy operate in an open and transparent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The key issue is the absence of control over bankers and the banking institutions.  We had a free-for-all caused by the displacement of good people from the banking system.  In the 1980s senior banking personnel and managers knew how to bank and did not lend money willy-nilly.  Systems and checks were in place and the good people running bank branches knew whether people could afford mortgages.  These managers were replaced with others who had a sales philosophy and wanted to lend money regardless of whether borrowers could afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">A generation of people are going to bed at night with the fear that they will not be in a position to pay back their mortgages.  The reason the Minister of State is not hearing about this is that it is a silent fear.  That is where the danger lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">We had an opportunity to seek out the expertise of those who were displaced, namely, retired bank managers and other banking personnel.  An open and transparent committee of inquiry could have tapped into their expertise and asked them to explain the reason they did not lend in a free-for-all fashion in the 1980s, what systems they had in place and what pressures they came under to change the philosophy of banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">What new systems were established as a result of the light touch regulation introduced by the Government?  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, enjoys a good reputation as a historian, while my background is in teaching.  What banking expertise do Members have?  In the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party Deputy Terence Flanagan worked in a bank.  Politicians cannot control bankers until we start to regulate them.  The only way we can regulate is to know how banking works.  However, because we do not know how the system works, the bankers are having a laugh and waiting for the National Asset Management Agency to acquire large parts of their books.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The silent mortgage holders and those who are not in a position to pay back their loans will not receive assistance or resources.  The bankers will still be in control and a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude will once again prevail.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_827">The Government should publicly apologise for the indefensible and incompetent manner in which it has dealt with the issue of Vietnamese adoptions.  It has neither acted in the best interests of children nor in the interests of prospective Irish adopters.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children has serious questions to answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">For five years there was a bilateral adoption agreement between Ireland and Vietnam.  By 31 December 2008, 636 adoptions effected in Vietnam by Irish adopters had been recognised by the Adoption Board.  At the start of 2009 there were an estimated 330 prospective adopters declared suitable to adopt by our Adoption Board who expected to adopt in Vietnam and who were assessed for adoption on the assumption that they would do so.  For five years it was known that the bilateral agreement would terminate by 1 May 2009.  However, the Government gave no warning or notice to the hundreds of people under adoption assessment by the HSE who intended to adopt in Vietnam that, following their obtaining a declaration of eligibility and suitability to adoption from our Adoption Board, this State would create any difficulty in their completing such adoptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The expired bilateral agreement contained provision for the establishment of a review group composed of Irish and Vietnamese officials to monitor the workings of the bilateral agreement and the adoption process in Vietnam involving Irish adoption applicants.  During the five years of the agreement's operation no report was ever published by this group warning of any difficulties.  It is clear that up to March 2009 the Government intended to put in place a new bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children informed this House that at the beginning of March a new proposed draft agreement was forwarded by the Government to the Vietnamese authorities.  Vietnam received the new draft agreement approximately seven weeks before the expiration of the original agreement and at that stage it was understood that the main difficulty related to the short period of time available to put in place a new agreement before 1 May 2009.  It was only in August 2009 that the Minister made known the fact that, as a result of two international reports on Vietnamese adoptions, one of which was a draft report prepared by International Social Services, questions were being asked about the probity of the Vietnamese adoption process.  It took six months from the receipt by the Minister of State of the draft ISS report to announce a Government decision not to enter into any further bilateral agreement on adoption with Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">The Minister of State with responsibility for children should publicly answer the following questions.  In his statement issued last Thursday, 14 January, he stated: "When any Government enters into a bilateral International Adoption Agreement, there is an expectation that the Government has satisfied itself that current policies and practices in the country of origin are robust."  What steps did the Government take to so be satisfied prior to entering into the bilateral adoption agreement which expired on 1 May 2009 and prior to furnishing to Vietnam a new proposed draft bilateral agreement in March 2009?</p>
            <p eId="para_831">During the currency of the expired bilateral agreement, what action, if any, was taken by representatives of this State appointed to the Ireland-Vietnam review group to ensure that Vietnamese adoption practices met appropriate standards and what reports, if any, on this issue were made to the Minister of State with responsibility for children or his predecessors?  Why has the Minister of State with responsibility for children refused to publish full details of meetings held by the review group and the reports, if any, furnished by it to him and the Department for Health and Children and why has the Department refused to make available relevant information and documentation when sought by me under the Freedom of Information Act?</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The Minister is only now critical of the link between the provision of humanitarian aid in conjunction with adoption services by an adoption agency licensed by this State to assist Irish applicants in effecting Vietnamese adoptions.  Why is this the case when the expired bilateral agreement, under which the agency operated, expressly envisaged the provision of such humanitarian aid and rendered it impossible for Irish applicants to effect Vietnamese adoptions without making a specific humanitarian aid payment?</p>
            <p eId="para_833">What consideration, if any, was given by the review group during the lifetime of the expired agreement to any difficulties arising as a consequence of the link between humanitarian aid and adoption services?  Why did the Minister for Children give assurances to 20 couples at an advanced stage in the Vietnamese adoption process after 1 May 2009 that satisfactory arrangements would be made to facilitate them completing Vietnamese adoptions and why have no such arrangements been made?   As a result of publication of the ISS report, has Vietnam refused to continue negotiations on the conclusion of a new bilateral agreement with this State or has the Government simply decided to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new agreement?  What consideration, if any, did the Government give to negotiating a new agreement incorporating provisions to address any concerns resulting from the ISS report and the creation of structures to properly and transparently monitor the workings of such agreement?</p>

            <p eId="para_835">There is nothing to prevent the Minister negotiating and completing an agreement with the Vietnamese that is compliant with the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption.  France, Spain, Italy and Canada, who have all ratified the Hague Convention, are continuing to facilitate adoptions from Vietnam and to ensure the necessary standards to protect the welfare of children are properly applied.  As a consequence of the incompetent manner in which the Government has dealt with this sensitive issue, hundreds of Irish adoption applicants are now left in limbo and hundreds of children for whom adoption would provide a better life may remain in orphanages.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">I will conclude with two more sentences.  Substantial HSE social work resources have been wasted in the assessment of adoption applicants with a focus solely on Vietnamese adoptions instead of a focus on foreign adoption generally.  Many of those left in limbo are now confronted with the prospect of their declarations of suitability and eligibility expiring and will have to apply to the Adoption Board for extensions and, in some cases, to the HSE for updated assessments.  Adopters are entitled to answers from the Minister of State.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_484">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_838">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to update the House on this matter.  The Adoption Bill 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, is continuing its progress through the Oireachtas and the debate on Second Stage is scheduled to resume on Thursday.  A core principle of the Hague Convention, which represents the international standard for adoption, is that intercountry adoption should be child centred.  The child's interests must be paramount throughout the adoption process.  The legislation and specifically the regime of the Hague Convention is designed to provide an assurance for individual children, their families and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is our intention that all intercountry adoptions must meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">Against this background, and after serious deliberation, the Government decided on 13 January to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral intercountry adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  As a result of this decision, all intercountry adoptions from Vietnam will be suspended until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 has been enacted and both Ireland and Vietnam have ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">Having met with many individuals and representative groups throughout this process, I am fully aware of the great disappointment this decision has caused and will cause for those hoping to adopt from Vietnam.  It is important to reiterate that this decision was not taken lightly and was based on information brought into the public domain by the Vietnamese Government in the first instance and subsequently by UNICEF with the co-operation of the Vietnamese Government.  Serious questions regarding adoption practices in Vietnam were raised in these two recent reports.  Such information cannot be ignored and the Government was obliged to act on foot of this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">Of greatest concern is the question of whether the child is adoptable.  The issues of consent and the exchange of fees were also raised.  Where questions on these fundamental issues remain, it would be remiss of the Government to allow adoptions from Vietnam to continue.  The Government has committed to providing technical assistance to the Vietnamese authorities in the area of child welfare and protection to help prepare the way for ratification of the Hague Convention should the Vietnamese wish to avail of such an offer.  Based on my discussions with the Vietnamese authorities, I am confident that Vietnam will ratify the Hague Convention in the near future, at which time I would hope and expect adoptions to resume.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">To state as Deputy Shatter has that the Government gave no warning to those hoping to adopt from Vietnam that a new bilateral agreement might not be put in place is not just wrong, it is most disingenuous.  On several occasions in recent months in both Houses, I stated that real concerns had been raised in the context of intercountry adoption from Vietnam and these would have to be addressed before a new agreement could be entered into.  When I shared a television studio with Deputy Shatter last October, I clearly explained the difficulties in putting in place a new bilateral agreement and said that there could be no certainty about the successful conclusion of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Deputy Shatter contends that the Government was dilatory in dealing with the UNICEF ISS report.  He claims the report was received last August and that it took the Government six months to act on it.  I remind the Deputy that the report was finalised in late November.  I said last October that I would await the finalisation of the report before making a recommendation to the Government.  I did not think it was correct to make a decision on the basis of a draft report that could not be made available to the adoption community.  The timeframe for the publication of the report was beyond the control of the Government.  The time that elapsed between the circulation of the draft report and the publication of the final report is a matter for the ISS.  To my mind, it involved dialogue with the Vietnamese Government and the embassies based on the ground in Hanoi.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">Following the Government decision, I met representative groups last week to update them on the situation.  I shared with them the contents of my statement prior to its circulation to the media.  The Adoption Board has agreed arrangements for people who had hoped to adopt from Vietnam.  All couples or individuals who possess a declaration of eligibility and suitability for Vietnam may select a new country from which to adopt, subject to submitting the usual change of country report to the Adoption Board.  They may also retain their current place on the helping hands list for Vietnam, which is being maintained.  In the event of Vietnam reopening, those on the Vietnamese waiting list whose declarations have not been used in the meantime to effect an adoption in another country will be in a position to proceed without delay, having regard to their position on the Vietnamese list.  All couples or individuals who have a declaration of eligibility and suitability for Vietnam but have sought to change in recent months will be in a position to avail of the foregoing arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">At all stages of the process, which has caused great anxiety and ultimately disappointment for couples or individuals hoping to adopt from Vietnam, I have consulted the adoption community and informed them of my actions.  I have no difficulty in standing before this House and accounting in full for the decisions I have made.  I suggest that Deputies on all sides should continue to have regard to the sensitivity of the matter at hand and respect the position of children who have been adopted into this country from Vietnam in recent years.  We all have a responsibility to these children.  The status of their adoptions is not in question.  The adoptions have gone through a lengthy legal process and have been entered into the register of foreign adoptions.  The Government must do its best to ensure that the interests of any child being adopted by Irish citizens are promoted and protected.  Deputy Shatter mentioned that 20 adoptions were at an advanced stage when negotiations were suspended.  It continues to be the position of the Government that it will try to facilitate the finalisation of such adoptions, subject to the serious legal difficulties that apply.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_846">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this important issue tonight.  I am extremely disappointed that neither the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government nor the Minister for Transport is present to respond to this Adjournment matter, which has been raised by five Deputies.  I am angry because the Ministers have not taken the time to come to the House to speak about an issue that is affecting every county.  Given that they were not here during the freeze itself, perhaps I should not expect them to be here tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">This has been one of the harshest winters of the past 50 years.  We have had frost and snow in County Clare since 22 December last.  I suppose it was not until the bad weather hit the city of Dublin that the Government decided to take some action.  We did not have the leadership needed to deal with the crisis, unfortunately.  We had no Taoiseach and no Tánaiste.  The only response was from the Minister, Deputy O'Dea.  When he was asked why the Army was not being called in, he said it had not been asked to come in.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, blamed everybody other than the Government for the crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">In the absence of leadership from the Government, local communities and local authorities stepped up to the plate to assist elderly people and grit neighbourhood roads.  I commend and compliment Clare County Council, which did a great job in keeping the main arteries open, despite its limited resources.  The problems caused by the big freeze were compounded when the thaw set in and the state of the roads became apparent.  Motorists have to contend with huge potholes as they go about their daily business.  Having driven on the roads of County Clare over recent days, I am familiar with the problems on the R465 between Limerick and Broadford, for example.  Roads like the N68 are badly afflicted with potholes.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews that the county councils do not have the money to deal with this situation.  Road maintenance grants have been slashed by 10%.  Like the other Deputies who are about to contribute to this debate, I want funding to be provided in my local area so that the roads which are in an atrocious condition can be repaired.  This is a road safety matter, in so far as lives will be saved if action is taken.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_486">
            <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_850">I express my gratitude to those who helped to keep roads open throughout the crisis in County Clare.  I refer to Mr. Tom Tiernan, who is the senior engineer in Clare County Council, his engineering staff, the outdoor staff and those who drove the gritting trucks.  I pay tribute to the voluntary efforts of communities throughout County Clare.  Many people played their part and put their shoulder to the wheel.  Such leadership and involvement was sadly lacking from the Government, however.  When the Minister, Deputy Gormley, eventually commented on the issue, he practically laughed at people.  The reality is that road maintenance grants were cut by 10% in last month's budget.  Those cuts followed the €7 million cut that Clare County Council experienced in 2009.  The council simply does not have the money to return the county's roads to the required and proper standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">I have listened to the statements made by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his colleague, the Minister for Transport.  It is unacceptable that they have said they will not fund local authorities.  Money will have to be forthcoming.  The Ministers cannot pretend that this did not happen.  Roads are being left in a very dangerous condition.  I travelled on many roads in County Clare over the weekend.  The road from Ennistymon to Kilfenora is falling apart.  The road from Broadford to Limerick is in a terrible condition, as is the road between Sixmilebridge and Newmarket-on-Fergus and other roads in the Clarecastle, Mountshannon and Whitegate districts.  This is a road safety issue.  I was encouraged by the reply to a parliamentary question that I received today, in which the Minister said he is looking for an audit of roads from local authorities.  I ask the Government to come up with the goods if such an audit is presented.  This is a road safety issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_487">
            <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
            <p eId="para_852">Wicklow County Council has been given €850,000 to maintain its roads in 2010.  With three weeks gone in the year and 49 weeks to go, I estimate that between €500,000 and €600,000 of that annual fund has been spent already.  One of today's newspapers reported that approximately €150 million — I imagine that was an educated guess — is needed to repair the damage done to this country's roads in recent times.  That equates to an average of approximately €4 million for each affected local authority.  It is encouraging that the Minister of State from the capital city is present in the Chamber.  It seems that his senior colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who represents a neighbouring constituency, did not take this crisis seriously until it started to affect the city.  As my colleagues have said, road infrastructure is the key to road safety.  It is also the key to attracting investment, business and tourism.  It is right that the road from the hotel in Glendalough to the upper lake car park was repaired last Sunday to make the road passable.  However, another section of road not too far away, which is used for access by a milk lorry, was not repaired.  If something positive is to come out of all of this, it is that local employment will have to be created as money is spent locally to repair our roads.  If this is not addressed, we will have no road infrastructure in 12 months' time.</p>

Since 17 December, heavy frost, snow and flooding have left our roads in a dangerous condition.  I call on the Ministers for Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide the director of services in Wexford County Council with the funds needed to address this serious problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">I commend the council's staff on the excellent work they have done over the past several weeks.  They are working within the funding constraints imposed by this Government.  It is an indictment of the Government that their budgets have already been drastically cut.

            <p eId="para_857">I do not expect the Minister for Transport to be in the country every day of the year because he is entitled to his holidays.  However, no command and control systems were in place to provide leadership in the aftermath of the weather crisis.  I drove into Dublin on the Wednesday night of the snowfall and encountered complete chaos.  I did not see a single figure of authority on the roads.  Emergency planning was non-existent.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">I recognise that it will be difficult to provide additional funding but it is important that the Minister determine the extent of the damage at the earliest opportunity.  I regret that he decided to transfer responsibility for funding non-national roads to the NRA.  I advise him to drive through parts of Wicklow, north Carlow, such as Clonmore, Hacketstown, Aughavanna and Deputy Doyle's country around Glendalough.  Unless he sees the devastation for himself, he will not understand the extent of the problem.  I do not know whether additional funding can be obtained from the EU but this issue needs to be addressed urgently because our roads were in a better condition 50 years ago.</p>

            <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_859">I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.  The Minister for Transport would like to express his sympathy to all who have been badly affected by the recent severe weather.  Indeed, some parts of the country have been hit more than once by the impact of the earlier flooding and the recent severe cold weather.  He also expresses his appreciation of the work done by the local authorities and the NRA and commends local authority frontline staff in particular on the exceptional work they did to deal with the impact of the recent extended period of severe weather.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">As well as the impact on the daily lives of citizens, there has been a serious impact on parts of the road network, as has become evident in recent days.  Damage to road surfaces is an inevitable consequence of the type of weather we have had in recent times.  Ireland has a uniquely extensive road network, with more than 96,000 km of road, or 2.5 times the EU average.  The maintenance and improvement of this network places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">Considerable resources have been spent in recent years on both the national and regional and local road networks.  The first priority therefore has to be to safeguard this investment in so far as this is possible, taking account of the recent weather impacts and the current difficulties with the public finances.  The response to recent events will have to carefully target the available resources to address the most urgently required repairs, taking account of key factors such as safety, the strategic importance of the individual road and traffic levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and supplemented by State road grants which are paid by the Department of Transport.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.  When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, the Department of Transport does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies because such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Rather, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.  Applications for additional funding to carry out remedial works to roads and bridges following bad weather and flooding can only be considered in exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">Earlier this year the Department of Transport asked those local authorities particularly affected by flooding to provide an assessment of the additional road costs incurred.  Last week, the Department requested all local authorities to provide information on the likely additional costs of the recent severe weather over and above their normal winter maintenance expenditure and to identify the principal components of the additional costs.  While the Department has received some information on the impact of the November flooding, the collection of information on the recent cold weather is still ongoing.  It will take some time to establish costs as the damage is still becoming evident and is being quantified on a daily basis.  However, the Minister has asked all local authorities to provide information as soon as possible to enable him to assess the full impact of the severe weather when deciding on the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations.  In allocating those grants the Minister will prioritise expenditure to deal with damage caused by the recent exceptional weather.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">It is particularly important that local authorities carefully reassess their planned road programmes for 2010 in light of the impact of the recent bad weather on their road networks.  The Minister asks them to prioritise necessary repairs to damage caused to roads by weather.  The first priority has to be the protection of the existing road network and particularly the massive Exchequer investment of €5.6 billion since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">The National Roads Authority generally fully reimburses local authorities for their expenditure on winter maintenance on national primary and national secondary roads.  The Minister is aware this expenditure has also increased substantially due to the bad weather.  The NRA will also be reviewing its expenditure priorities for 2010 in the light of the damage caused to national roads.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_866">By nature of the matter under discussion, I will speak about correspondence between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and elderly people and pensioners.  Major distress has been caused by correspondence sent in recent days to a significant number of elderly people which cites section 110(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 as the basis for informing them that their pensions are being withdrawn and refunds of payments sought.  In some cases, people are being notified that the payments for which they are awaiting approval are being withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">The basis for this decision is that the people in question did not pay PRSI contributions before they reached the age of 66.  However, the correspondence sneakily omits section 110(2), which states: "Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister may, where he or she is satisfied that in all the circumstances of the case it would be appropriate to do so, direct that <i>subsection (1) </i>shall not be applied in that case.”  I contend the individuals in question have been approved under section 110(2) of the Act and, having carried these applications across the threshold of eligibility by establishing that a farm or business partnership existed and that retrospective PRSI payments could be made, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs cannot now decide to retrospectively withdraw her discretionary approval to pay the pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">If a satisfactory response is not given to us tonight, we will raise the issue by every parliamentary device available to us to ensure the Government recognises the folly of the course it is attempting to follow.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_494">
            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_869">I support the points made by my colleague, Deputy Creed.  I do not understand the rationale behind the Minister's approach to this matter other than as a money-saving mechanism.  The section of the legislation to which Deputy Creed referred makes clear this is a matter of ministerial responsibility.  It is clearly the Minister who has made the decision to contact these people to indicate that their pension entitlement will be withdrawn. I questioned the Minister on this issue earlier today in the House and am disappointed she is not here to address it on the Adjournment.  She told us that 87 people are currently affected by the change, but this number does not take account of the many more who will be affected when they reach the age of eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The Minister has it entirely in her power to withdraw the notice sent out to the persons concerned.  Her staff throughout the State made the relevant calculations on the applicants' behalf and told them how much they would have to contribute in order to be eligible for the allowance.  Some people have been making contributions and have now received a letter asking that they withdraw the moneys submitted.  This is unfair and miserly.  It makes little of the legitimate expectation of those involved in the commercial partnerships in question, as set out to them by departmental staff.  That expectation was fulfilled by way of payment in the case of at least 87 of them.  Like my colleague, I call on the Minister to act upon the power accorded to her under subsection 110(2) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to ensure those payments are made.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_495">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_871">The scheme in question was announced on 25 June 2008 by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  She said at the time that it was "hugely important" for women who have over many years contributed greatly to family commercial partnerships and that it would "primarily benefit women who are approaching pension age but are not covered for a contributory pension".  The details of the scheme were published in social welfare booklet SW124.  The booklet, which I and many of my colleagues have used in advising clients and constituents, makes no mention of the fact that the individual must have paid at least one contribution prior to turning 56 years of age.  It is important to note that when a spouse is assessed by the Department and qualified to back pay PRSI for earlier years, the PRSI then collected includes, in the majority of cases, PRSI for years prior to the applicant's 56th birthday.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">In the letters sent out to applicants informing them that they will not qualify for the pension, the Department has, as Deputy Creed noted, only referred to subsections 110(1)(<i>a</i>) and 110(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  There is no reference to subsection 110(2) which states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_873">Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister may, where he or she is satisfied that in all the circumstances of the case it would be appropriate to do so, direct that <i>subsection (1) </i>shall not be applied in that case.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">In other words, the Minister has the power to overturn this decision in respect of those persons who have made contributions.  At the very least, those who have already been awarded a pension should retain that entitlement.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_496" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_875">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions.  On foot of a programme for Government commitment, an information leaflet, entitled "Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements",<i/>was developed between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on 25 June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory State pension and other social welfare benefits.  Following the above campaign, more than 1,000 applications for commercial partnership status were received, of which 579 applications have been finalised, including 508 that were approved.  Applications for pension or benefit are submitted and processed in the usual way.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">To qualify for a contributory State pension, several conditions must be satisfied.  A person must have at least 260 paid social insurance contributions, with a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited since entry into the social insurance scheme.  Applicants must have entered into social insurance before attaining the age of 56 years.  In addition, subsection 110(1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for a contributory State pension unless he or she has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining the pensionable age of 66 years and all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.  The above condition in respect of one year's paid self-employed contributions before reaching age 66 has been in existence since 5 April 1995.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">A State pension is a valuable benefit and it is important that the conditions applied ensure that those qualifying for payment have an adequate and sustained history of contributions to the social insurance fund over their working lives.  Approximately 268 applications for a contributory State pension have been received under this scheme.  Following a review of these pension claims, it was discovered that several individuals who had been in receipt of a pension did not satisfy the condition whereby they were required to have paid at least one year's self-employment contributions before reaching age 66.  As they did not satisfy this condition, they have been notified that their claims have been disallowed from the date of pension award.  To date, 97 claims for contributory State pension which were in payment have been disallowed and 16 customers have had their rates reduced.  However, following the provision of additional information by some customers and further investigation in conjunction with Revenue, ten of the 97 cases above have had their payments reinstated.  A further 46 customers have failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions and accordingly their claims have been refused.  One further case is currently under investigation.  Overpayments will be determined in the above cases and the customers will be notified and requested to repay the amounts involved.  However, a recovery officer may reduce or cancel an overpayment based on the circumstance of an individual case, in line with the governing legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">There are 121 additional applications for commercial partnerships currently being processed by the scope section of the Department where the persons concerned have not paid any self-employment contributions prior to reaching age 66.  If a favourable partnership decision is reached these persons may incur a PRSI liability for the years in question.  These customers will not satisfy the condition that they paid self-employment contributions prior to reaching age 66.  Last week the Department contacted all applicants to advise them of the position and to ascertain whether they wish the Department to continue its investigation or if they wish to withdraw their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">While the publication of the leaflet to which I referred clarified existing procedures in regard to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.  In particular, the clarification of the position did not alter people's potential entitlements, and all applicants for the contributory State pension must continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions contained in legislation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_883">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">There are currently over 93,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of almost 26% since the end of 2008. Over 35,000 or 38% have been in payment for 18 months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The Rental Accommodation Scheme or RAS, which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these tenants are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised that, at end November 2009, local authorities have transferred almost 9,000 rent supplement cases to private sector RAS units. An additional 4,000 rent supplement cases have been transferred to voluntary sector RAS units. Housing authorities have also transferred a further 11,000 recipients to other social housing options, making a total of over 24,000 transfers since 2005. Almost 7,000 recipients were transferred in 2008 with a further 6,000 transferred up to November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly, and in 2010 a target has been set of transferring an additional 8,000 households from rent supplement. The number of unsold affordable housing stock around the country and the move to long term leasing by local authorities, creates an opportunity to accelerate transfers and the current market conditions should contribute to achieving further savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">Rent supplement tenants are required to make a minimum contribution towards their rent. This contribution was increased by €11 to €24 in two phases in 2009 as a budgetary measure. This change allows for a better alignment with the contribution payable under the differential rent scheme applying to RAS tenants. This will encourage more people to take up RAS offers.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">A Value for Money and Policy Review of RAS is being conducted by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Department and will commence this month. Officials of my department will participate in the review and will also continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</p>

        <b>Deputy Liz McManus</b>
         asked the

         the estimated fraud rate within each scheme and the target savings she is setting for each scheme in 2010. 
        [1793/10]

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_891">In order to identify fraud and error levels in schemes the Department carries out detailed fraud and error surveys on individual schemes.  These surveys provide evidence based indicators for the levels of fraud and error within those schemes at that particular time.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">As reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General the percentage of expenditure resulting from fraud identified in these surveys ranged from 0% for pensioners, to 0.1% for Illness Benefit, 0.8% for the Family Income Supplement, 1.8% for Child Benefit, 2.3% for the Disability Allowance and 6.4% for the One Parent Family Payment.  A fraud and error survey is currently underway on Jobseeker's Allowance and the results of that will be available by quarter 2, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">Although the level of fraud on most schemes is very low, within schemes, some categories of claimants can be a much higher risk than others and when these are identified the Department moves to address the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Because of the resources involved, the Department's goal is to carry out fraud and error surveys on each of the major schemes every two years. This frequency is considered reasonable having regard to the need to consider the impact of measures taken to address issues raised in previous surveys.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">The amount of money recorded as control savings by the Department at the end of 2009 was €484 million.  This represented an increase of €8 million on 2008 figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">In 2009 over 750,000 claims were reviewed, 20% more than the target for the year.  The total control savings target for 2010 is €533m.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">Additional savings are being sought on the One Parent Family and Illness Benefit payments, bringing the total targets for these schemes to approximately €100m and €110m respectively. A target of €110m has also been set for pensions, including additional savings on the non-contributory scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">Over €82million is being targeted on Child Benefit, approximately €81m is being targeted on jobseeker's payments and €16.5m is expected to be saved on carers payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">The remaining sums are €17m on the Family Income Supplement, €10m on the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and €6m in the PAYE and PRSI areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The vast majority of people who seek a Social Welfare payment are doing so correctly and within their entitlement.  However, I am determined to ensure that abuse of the social welfare system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected. To this end, the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective. The 2010 targets take account of the extra anti-fraud powers provided in the Social Welfare Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_905">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 106, 112 and 119 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">I fully appreciate that becoming unemployed and having to claim a jobseeker's payment is stressful enough in itself and that it is vital that people get access to financial supports as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">As Deputies will be aware, the number of people on the live register grew by over 45% in the 12 months to December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">The Department of Social and Family Affairs has sought to manage this increase as well as it possibly can and to keep delays to a minimum. Improved processes and procedures have helped to increase productivity among existing staff, over 400 extra people have been assigned to claim processing since May 2008 and centralised units have been set up to relieve some of the pressure on the busiest offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The average processing times for claims decided in December was two weeks for jobseeker's benefit and just over six weeks for the jobseeker's allowance. This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices. In December, 4 out of every 5 claims for jobseeker's benefit were processed within 3 weeks and 2 out of every 3 claims for the means tested payment jobseeker's allowance were processed within 6 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">Processing times can vary depending on the complexity of the claim and the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant and or their employer. In the case of jobseeker's allowance claims, carrying out means assessments and determining whether a claimant satisfies the Habitual Residence Condition can also take time.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">Processing times can also vary from office to office due to the extent of the increased claimload, the number of staff vacancies, the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">From time to time the average processing time for an individual office can vary considerably. This can occur where, for example, an office concentrates on clearing the claims that have been awaiting a decision the longest.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">I am making available a tabular statement showing the average processing time for claims decided in December for each local and branch office. Claims for branch offices are decided in their parent local office.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">While I know that processing times are still too long in some areas, it should be noted that the additional resources and process improvement measures that have been put in place are having an impact. For example, the number of jobseeker's claims awaiting a decision on 9th January last was 30% lower than in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">While every effort is made to ensure that applications are processed as quickly as possible, anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseeker's payment can apply for supplementary welfare allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions. It is open to anyone who is not satisfied with the decision on their claim to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">I assure the House that the Department will continue to prioritise reducing the unacceptable delays in deciding welfare claims that are evident in a small number of offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1289">Responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) transferred to the Citizens Information Board (CIB) in 2009 and will provide strong management support to the local voluntary MABS companies. MABS assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. The role of money advisors is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors. MABS is now dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in respect of clients who are presenting with multiple creditors/debts. It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance. This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL. In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>. The helpline dealt with 24,000 callers in 2009 and 11,000 in 2008. The number of calls received in 2009 remained constant throughout the year at 6,000 per quarter. Some 19,000 new clients approached MABS for assistance in 2009. This compares with 16,600 new clients in 2008 and 12,734 in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">In 2009, funding of almost €18m was allocated to MABS and included provision for 19 additional money advisers, bringing the total number of staff to 271. The MABS funding for 2010 is included in the CIB allocation of €46.2m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">All MABS companies operate an appointment system for clients. Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and are dealt with promptly. Less urgent cases are referred to the MABS Helpline and to the MABS website in the first instance. Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor. Some 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">From first point of contact to first appointment with a money advisor the average waiting time is currently 4.5 weeks. This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices. During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">I am satisfied that the additional resources provided to MABS will assist them to meet the demand for their services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1296">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the Department.  These reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department's control can impact upon claim processing times e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">From January 2009, new processing targets, based on processing 90% of claims within a particular timescale, varying from scheme to scheme, were introduced for all schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">Specific process improvements have been introduced across many areas of the Department.  Some recent examples of  these are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1301">
              <b>Jobseeker’s</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1302">A range of process improvement initiatives to deal with the increased volume of Jobseeker's claims has been introduced.  In addition, five Local Office Support Units have been set up around the country to support the processing of claims.  The number of claims awaiting a decision as of the 9 January 2010 was 58,800.  This is huge reduction on the 82,000 that were pending in July and illustrates that the additional resources that have been assigned to local offices coupled with the range of process improvement initiatives are having a positive effect.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1303">
              <b>State Pensions</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1304">In order to ensure that entitlement to a pension is decided by the due date all pensioners are advised to apply at least three months in advance of pension age and people are pro-actively invited to claim.   In addition, a desk assessment process has been introduced in State Pension Non-Contributory, whereby claims are processed and decided based on the information provided by the customer on their application form without recourse to investigation by a Social Welfare Inspector.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1305">
              <b>Automated processing and Online Application Forms</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1306">To ensure that claims are processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlements in a timely manner all application forms have been designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing.  An online facility to enable applications for a number of schemes, i.e. State Pension (Contributory) and Household Benefits, to be completed and submitted online, has been implemented.  This facility will be extended to other schemes in the coming months.   The objective is to enable people to access services at a time and place that best suits their needs.  The use of online application forms reduces the administrative burden for customers and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1307">Overall, I appreciate the need to ensure that people can receive financial support from the Department as early as possible and I assure the House that we continuously strive to improve processing times in all schemes.   In the meantime, it is important to remember that people who have urgent income support needs can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) and that more than 95% of basic SWA applications are decided on and paid within a week.</p>

         when she plans to reform the back to education allowance to make it more compatible with the Central Applications Office application process for third level courses and the academic year.

            <p eId="para_1309">The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is designed to help those in receipt of a social welfare payment to improve their employability and job-readiness by acquiring additional educational qualifications. It is a second chance education opportunities scheme that recognises the special difficulties that people on social welfare can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market. It is designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">The scheme enables eligible people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course. The scheme is self-selecting in nature and responsibility for securing a place on an approved course rests with the applicant. Once a place has been secured, an applicant can check with the Department as to whether the other eligibility criteria for participation in the back to education scheme are fulfilled. Payment under the scheme covers the relevant academic year and the scheme caters for approved courses where the starting date is not aligned to the standard academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">In order to qualify for participation, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the national employment action plan process or engaging with the Department's facilitator programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the back to education scheme. A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">The number of participants in 2008/2009 academic year was 11,646. Final figures for the current academic year are not yet finalised. However, the number of people on the scheme at the end of November 2009 was 20,418 which is 88% higher than the figure of 10,854 at the end of November 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">The back to education scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market. The qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and the changing economic circumstances.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1318">I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">The household benefits package is payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households to assist them with their heating, light and cooking costs. This scheme cost approximately €200m in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">In addition, the national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the additional cost of their heating needs during the winter season. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full and must be seen in the context of the overall level of income available to the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">In Budget 2009, the duration of the payment was increased by an extra 2 weeks to 32 weeks, while the weekly value of the allowance was increased by €2 to €20 a week, or €23.90 in designated smokeless areas. This compares with just €14 and €17.90 respectively in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing. Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">The Government has announced its intention to introduce a carbon tax, which will come into effect on heating products from May 2010 and on solid fuels at a date to be set by commencement order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">Before the tax is applied to fuels for home heating, arrangements are being made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of €130 million in funding for insulation, €76 million of which will be used to assist low income families. The Government is also conscious that families at risk of fuel poverty will need extra income support to meet the increasing costs of fuel as a result of the carbon tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter- Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area. The objective is to ensure a shared understanding of the challenges and actions underway and to ensure a fully cohesive strategic approach to delivery of affordable energy initiatives and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">The Inter Departmental/Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy for consultation early in 2010. This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">As part of its work, the Group will make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty in advance of the implementation of the carbon tax on home heating products.</p>

            <p eId="para_1332">I propose to take Questions Nos.  92, 101 and 116 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  A key objective of the Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">The Department processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and it makes payments to over one million people every week.  The vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">Welfare fraud is theft. It is a serious crime and the Department is doing everything that it can to crack down on people who abuse the system.  There are over 620 staff working in areas related to control of fraud and abuse of the welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">The level of fraud on most schemes is very low. As reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the percentage of expenditure resulting from fraud identified in the Department's Fraud and Error surveys was 0% for pensioners, 0.1% for Illness Benefit, 0.8% for the Family Income Supplement, 1.8% for Child Benefit and 2.3% for the Disability Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">Nonetheless, the Department is conscious that in a small number of schemes, some groups of claimants present a higher risk than others and we have made changes to address this.  For example, a number of individual surveys have highlighted a high level of risk that non-Irish nationals could claim welfare payments to which they are no longer entitled after they have left the State.  Having identified this risk, the Department has sought to minimise it by removing the option to receive payments by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) for new claimants of jobseeker payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">Targeted control measures have also been put in place in relation to other customer segments in schemes where any form of high risk has been identified.  Since the department started the cross-border operations, the percentage year-on-year increase in people signing on for jobseeker's payments in virtually all of the border offices had reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">Fraud detection systems have also been improved through data matches with organisations such as the Revenue Commissioners on commencement of employment data, the General Registrars Office on Marriages and Deaths information, and many other organisations including the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education and other state bodies.  In addition, a data matching programme is now in place to ensure that relevant information available in one area of the Department is applied to all schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">Greater emphasis was also placed last year on prevention of fraud and error at the claim application stage. While this is of course the most cost effective mechanism of reducing unwarranted welfare expenditure, it should be noted that savings achieved in this way are not included in the published figures for control savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">For 2009, the Department set a target of reviewing almost 620,000 individual welfare claims. In fact over 750,000 reviews were actually carried out last year — 20% more than the annual target. The total fraud and error savings recorded for the year was approximately €484 million. While this was lower than the target set for 2009, it represented an increase of €8 million on the 2008 figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">In considering the level of savings recorded in 2009, it is important to note that the final average live register figure for the year, at 395,500, was significantly lower than the 440,000 that had been predicted when the annual target was set. Also, while it is difficult to identify exactly why the above-target number of reviews did not generate higher savings, it may be partially due to decreased opportunities for people to work and claim. Increased emphasis on preventing unwarranted claims at the initial application stage may also have led to a reduction in the number of claims having to be stopped after they have gone into payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">It is also worth noting that the 2009 control savings from several schemes were ahead of target. These include Child Benefit, One Parent Family Payment, Illness payments and Pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">The number of anonymous reports from members of the public has increased dramatically in the past year, with over 6,400 reports made at end 2009 compared to approximately 1,000 reports made in 2008.  Each report is followed-up and savings are included in the savings reported within the individual scheme areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them. In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective. As Deputies will be aware, the recent Social Welfare Bill included extra anti-fraud powers for the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1347">The earlier question, to which Deputy Naughten makes reference, asked about "plans to review the habitual residence condition rules or the existing legislation in view of the recent decisions of the appeals office regarding cases by asylum seekers".</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">Section 15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009, passed by this House on 15 December 2009, provided for an amendment to the habitual residence provisions to deal with this matter. The new provisions list those who have a legal right to reside in the State and those who do not have such a right, and state that those who do not have such a right shall not be regarded as habitually resident for the purposes of any claim for social welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">A deciding officer or appeals officer may not therefore rule that a person, who has been refused permission to remain in the State, or whose application has not yet been determined, satisfies the habitual residence condition. Where a decision is given granting permission to remain, the question of whether that person is habitually resident will be made in the light of the factors set out since 2007 in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. The determination will be made with effect from the date that permission is granted, or from the date of application for the payment in question if the application was not lodged until after that date.</p>

            <p eId="para_1353">A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseeker's benefit expires.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website. This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed. This helps reduce queuing times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">The process for casual employees has been streamlined and the employee can now self certify on a weekly basis without recourse to the employer. A compensatory periodic control measure has been introduced for employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">One of the most significant initiatives introduced recently aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending the office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided. This system has already been introduced in 20 offices. The Department plans to extend it up to a further 25 offices and over the next few weeks it will be introduced in Cavan, Clonmel, Ennis, Tralee, Arklow, Wexford, Finglas, Navan Road, Kilbarrack, Swords and Dun Laoghaire.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">I realise the importance of getting claims decided as quickly as possible and I want to assure the Deputy that staff in local offices and in the Department's inspectorate are doing all they can to reduce the numbers of claims awaiting a decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1735">Rent supplement is payable to people who are unable to meet the cost of renting private accommodation and is intended as a short-term support. There are currently over 93,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 26% since the end of 2008. The provisional outturn on Rent Supplement for 2009 is €507.68 million. Budget 2010 provided for expenditure of €509m in 2010, after the achievement of €20m savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the state.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">It is essential to ensure that state support for rent supplemented tenants, who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices with particular negative impact on those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low paid employment. The Government is determined to ensure that reductions in rent levels generally in the year to date result in savings for the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">Maximum rent limits are prescribed in regulations and are time limited so that they can be adjusted in the light of rent levels generally. The most recent regulations cover the period 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2010. Rent limits can, however, be reviewed at any time. Notwithstanding rent limits, the Community Welfare Service may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure to meet special needs. Equally the Community Welfare Service also pays below prescribed rent limits in the light of rent levels in the local rental market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Budget 2010 provided for €20m savings in the rent supplement scheme arising from a review of the maximum rent limits. To this end, the maximum level of rent supplement payable by the State will be reviewed early in 2010 on the basis of the latest data available on general trends in rental prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The review will be conducted with reference to analysis of rents recorded with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the CSO private rent index and data from the Daft.ie property website. The maximum rent limits payable will then be adjusted and new limits will apply in respect of all new tenancies or renewals of tenancies from April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">Indications are that rents in the private rented sector continue to fall since limits were reviewed in 2009. Based on current information available about decreases in rent levels, the Department expects the rent review to lead to savings of €20 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_1746">I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 127, 720 and 787 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families. These included proposals for the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">The current duration of the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society. Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to: Prevent long term dependence on social welfare income support and facilitate financial independence. Recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely.  Change the expectations surrounding receipt of the OFP, introducing an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">Income supports are only one element of the supports required by those parenting alone. Other co-ordinated supports and services required include access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures. These must also be addressed by the relevant Departments and Agencies if lone parents are to be enabled to access employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">It has not been possible to progress the proposals as outlined in the Government discussion paper, including the removal of the cohabitation rule, due, in part, to current economic conditions. These proposals have, however, informed deliberations regarding the scheme. The Government is considering various options for limiting the length of time for which the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) can be paid (including the age of the youngest child).  Any such changes would be phased in over a period of years for existing recipients to enable lone parents to access education and training and to prepare for their return to the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1753">I propose to take Question Nos. 97 and 125 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">Domiciliary Care Allowance is payable in respect of children who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. The care and attention received must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the normal activities of daily life. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted by the applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">In the period 1st April 2009 to 31st December 2009 a total of 3,389 applications were received, of which 2,823 cases have to date been fully processed by the Department. Of these applications, 1,031 were awarded and 1,792 refused as they were deemed not to be eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance. 566 applications are still to be decided. The tabular statement sets out the number of applications received and the number of applications processed each month from April to December 2009.  During 2009, decisions made on 564 claims were reviewed at the applicants request as new or additional medical evidence was available, of these 117 claims were subsequently allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">Where claims are deemed to be ineligible on medical grounds, it is because it is considered that the requirement of care and attention and/or supervision is not substantially in excess of another child of the same age who does not have a disability. Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">There were 836 appeals of Domiciliary Care Allowance decisions received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 which variously consisted of appeals in relation to the commencement date of the claim, satisfying the Habitual Resident Condition or meeting the medical criteria for the scheme. The Social Welfare Appeals Office made decisions on 11 cases in 2009 and overturned the decision in 6 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">All claims that have had the original negative decision revised have been processed by the Department and payment has issued to the customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1805">Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  They work in close co-operation with other agencies and service providers including FÁS, VEC, other education and training providers and the local and community and voluntary sector.  In addition, they provide advice and support to customers who wish to access the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme, and the short term enterprise allowance scheme of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The facilitator service is available locally to all social welfare recipients via the local network. Facilitators are assigned to cover a geographical area.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1809">The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers. It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for all those who are reliant on the State for income support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended. Where people are caring for more than one person they receive a higher payment. This equates to the personal rate for a person with the same means who is caring for one person plus 50% of the maximum personal rate. Recipients with children also receive a qualified child increase in respect of each child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rates for carers over 66 years of age have not been changed and remain at €239. The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded. Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reductions announced in last year's Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits. A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process to develop a National Carers' Strategy. However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it is not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy. This position remains unchanged.</p>

These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and convened an inter-departmental /agency group on affordable energy, in June 2008, to coordinate government policy in this area. The group, which is co-chaired by the Social Inclusion Division of this Department, comprises officials of the departments of the Taoiseach, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Finance, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, the Commission for Energy Regulation, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Institute of Public Health in Ireland and the ESB and Bord Gáis. Officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs who have responsibility for the fuel allowance and household benefits schemes participate in the group.  The objective of the group's work is to ensure shared understanding of the challenges and actions underway and to ensure a fully cohesive, strategic approach to the delivery of affordable energy initiatives and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">The group has been asked to develop an affordable energy strategy encompassing the policies and initiatives required to improve energy affordability in Ireland. As part of its terms of reference, the group will seek to identify an appropriate methodology for the measurement and reporting of energy poverty in Ireland and to assess the extent of energy poverty in Ireland. I am advised that the group will commence its deliberations this month with a view to finalising the strategy following a period of consultation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1834">I propose to take Question Nos. 103, 769, 775, 780 and 785 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards, the Government set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance. An initial sum of €10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">The Department and the Community Welfare Service of the HSE are working with the various statutory and other agencies also working in this area, to ensure that the humanitarian assistance scheme will go towards alleviating the hardship which many hundreds of families have had to endure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">Community Welfare Service staff throughout the country have been providing support to families since this flooding occurred. Up to the 8th January 2009 they had already made over 1,748 payments to 1,038 individuals to the value of €652,000. The average payment per individual is €628, with the largest payment to an individual in excess of €8,000. All payments to those affected by the flooding are being provided for under the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">While the timescale for determining applications for Humanitarian Assistance claims is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, there is no backlog of undecided claims. According to the information available from the HSE, as of 8th January 2010, there were approximately 50 applications currently being assessed. Only one claim refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">Payments have been provided for emergency financial and other assistance to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs. The Community Welfare Service will continue to make these payments as long as there is a requirement to do so. Such emergency payments under the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are made without delay and without regard to the household income as the primary objective of these payments is to address the person's immediate needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">As the flood waters have receded in some areas, individuals are now in a better position to assess the extent of the damage to their homes. In these cases, payments have been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Assistance is also available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">Very few large scale claims have been made at this stage as homeowners have not yet established the cost of repair. In many cases, they are awaiting builder's estimates. It is expected that large scale claims will be received over the coming weeks. These claims will take somewhat longer to process as they will require verification of the loss and the possible use of a loss assessor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual depends on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances. The scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses are not covered by the scheme nor are losses which are covered by household insurance. The repair of cars damaged in the recent icy conditions is also not covered by the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">The question of permanent housing relocation payments is a housing issue to be dealt with by the relevant housing authorities. However, the Community Welfare Service will continue to work with any families in this position to ensure that the objectives of the humanitarian aid scheme are fully achieved in their case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">Applications under the scheme are being income tested to ensure that available assistance is prioritised for those who are most vulnerable. The basic objective of the income test is to determine the household's capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition. All household income is considered when determining entitlement to payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">Detailed guidelines have been provided to the HSE in relation to the income test. These guidelines also contain a list of the type of goods/appliances that are generally covered by the scheme and what replacement value should typically be attributable to each item. This list is not exhaustive and is intended as a guide only. The Community Welfare Service has full discretion to make payments at a higher level than a strict application of the income test would warrant in any individual case where it considers it appropriate to do so. This income test and guidelines simplify the assessment process and to allow for the speedy processing of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office. Further information and applications forms in relation to the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department's website (<i>www.welfare.ie</i>) and the HSE’s website (<i>www.hse.ie</i>).</p>

            <p eId="para_1850">The mortgage interest supplement scheme provides support for people who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme provides a short-term income "safety net" within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment or other changes in circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">A supplement in respect of mortgage interest only may be paid to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  There are currently over 15,100 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of almost 87% (7,000) over the numbers in payment at the end of December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">The assessment for the mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">A review of the administration of the mortgage interest scheme is progressing.  The main purpose of the review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">The review group includes representatives from this Department, the Community Welfare Service, the Departments of Finance, and Environment, Heritage and Local Government together with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator.  The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator's statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears on the mortgage interest supplement scheme and legislative and operational issues arising, including the cap on hours of employment.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme's objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.  The full review should be complete and available for publication by the end of Q1 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">Guidelines on certain operational issues for community welfare officers administering the scheme, were updated in June 2009. The guidelines are available on the Department's website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>

The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.  In 2009 some 2,618 special accounts were set up with the local Credit Unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">Focused training programmes designed to equip money advice staff and local management boards to meet the demands on the services are provided by MABS NDL, the national support company.  In addition, MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the services in managing their increased caseloads.  These include a money management education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to a local MABS office or to an appropriate alternative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">An operational protocol ‘Working Together to Manage Debt' is in place and is the result of almost 2 years work by MABS NDL and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF), the main representative body for the banking and financial services sector.  The Protocol applies to all client debts, including mortgage debt owed to the major lending institutions in Ireland and includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Last year an additional 19 money advisers were recruited by MABS between September and December, bringing the number of MABS staff to 271.  The additional advisors have been appointed to MABS companies throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">I am confident that the MABS is well equipped to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1866">The objective of the back to education allowance scheme is to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market. The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline (level 8 in National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)) and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching, level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person's employability. Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">The possession of qualifications at level 9 or above in the NFQ is not regarded as a prerequisite to re-entering the workforce. A small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master's course on the basis of relevant life experience. In the context of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, it was decided to extend entitlement to BTEA in these instances on an exceptional basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">The focus of the back to education allowance is on providing assistance to the highest possible number of those in greatest need in terms of meeting the requirements of a modern labour market. People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects. There are no immediate plans to extend the scheme to cover Master's courses in general. The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_1870">The Department administers a number of social assistance schemes to meet the income support needs of certain people.  The associated means tests are designed to reflect the particular circumstances of these individuals and their families as well as the different life cycle stages.  Over the years, various developments in means testing have led to the system becoming complex and difficult for the individual to comprehend.  The Department would wish to move to a simpler more unified approach to means testing, especially for those of working age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">As a separate but related exercise, the Department is currently examining the feasibility of introducing a single social assistance payment for people of working age. The review will examine the rules and conditions, including the means testing rules, that currently apply and the various supports available to people of working age with a view to ascertaining how these could be rationalised in the context of a single payment to meet the objective of supporting people back to work, education and/or training and other development opportunities, as appropriate. It is expected that the feasibility report will be finalised by early 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">An inter-departmental working group was established in March 2009, on foot of a recommendation in the Task Force Report <i>Transforming Public Services</i>, to undertake a detailed study on the feasibility and value of introducing mechanisms to simplify the provision of means information to all public bodies.  This working group is chaired by a senior official of this Department. While the group is not examining a proposal for a unified means test, its work will include consideration of all possibilities in relation to simplifying and achieving other efficiencies across all public bodies with regard to means testing arrangements.  The work of the group is progressing well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1874">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2009 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 24 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to 15.8 weeks. This represents an increase of 2 weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared to 2008, but must be seen in the context of an increase of 46% in the number of appeals received during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases, further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required and circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">To deal with the increased workload being experienced by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed during the year. However, the Chief Appeals Officer and five experienced Appeals Officers retired during 2009. Although their positions have now been filled these retirements impacted on the processing of appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">The matter of assigning additional Appeals Officers is kept under constant review but any consideration of extra assignments must be taken in the context of overall government policy on civil service numbers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1884">As Deputies are aware, the Green Paper on Pensions outlined the challenges facing the Irish pensions system in the years ahead, including the sustainability of the system over the longer term in light of demographic change and the adequacy of contribution levels and benefits.  The consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper reflected the wide range of views and interests held by individuals and organisations throughout the country.  While there was no consensus on ways to respond to the challenges facing our pension system, it was clear that there were significant issues and problems that people wanted addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">Since the Green Paper was published in October 2007, the economic environment has changed considerably and the Government need to ensure that any decisions we make in the pensions area will be robust enough to withstand the challenges which will arise in the future.  We must make decisions now to ensure the adequacy of retirement incomes for this and future generations while, at the same time, develop a system which is affordable and sustainable for the State and for those who sponsor and provide pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">In the past 18 months or so the Government has taken a number of steps to respond to the immediate difficulties facing pension scheme members, particularly members of defined benefit schemes.   These include the establishment of a pensions insolvency payment scheme and a reordering of wind-up priorities so that, in any defined benefit wind-up situation, employees and former employees who have not yet retired may still receive a large proportion of their benefits.  Legislation to support these measures was passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009.  The Government has also introduced provisions to allow for more flexible restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation regarding remittance of pension contributions.  We have also protected people in receipt of the State Pension by retaining the rates of pension and other social welfare payments for older people in the recent Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">The Government is aware that the wider and longer-term pensions policy issues require a comprehensive and co-ordinated response and we have been considering a number of options to address the challenges facing our pension system.   Uncertainty in the economic climate has increased the complexity of the decisions we must make but it does not prevent or deter the Government from making these vitally necessary decisions.  However, it does require us to give very careful consideration, and it is precisely because the development of the framework involves decisions on such a wide range of future and complex issues that we have been spending a considerable amount of time working on it.  I hope to be in a position to publish the framework shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1889">The Department endeavours to process applications for refunds of PRSI as efficiently as possible. However, the volume of applications for refunds of PRSI has increased dramatically in recent years; some 23,400 applications were received in 2009 compared to 14,000 in 2008 and 9,000 in 2007. The increased volume of applications has inevitably given rise to a delay in processing refund applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">In order to speed up the processing of refund applications, the processes and procedures in the section have been reviewed and appropriate changes implemented along with new technical supports. Furthermore, in December 2009, an additional five staff were assigned to the area on a temporary basis to help clear the number of applications on hand. The Department is also continuing to examine ways of making better use of modern technology, e.g. payment of refunds by electronic fund transfer, online applications and enhancement of the current calculation functionality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">The additional staff, more streamlined processes and procedures and technical supports have already shown positive results. In December 2009, refunds were processed for about 265 applicants per week compared with about 160 per week in October and November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">With the implementation of further process improvements and technical supports, I am confident that further improvements will be made in the processing of applications for refunds.</p>

            <p eId="para_1896">Every effort is made to process claims for social welfare payments as quickly as possible. Staff in the Department are aware of the concerns of claimants who find themselves in need of a payment. Delays can occur in the processing of claims where additional information is required or where all documentation is not to hand. On means-tested schemes it may be necessary for the person to be visited in their home by a Social Welfare Inspector for the purpose of assessing the means and this can add to the time involved in finalising the claim. Cases involving self-employment or property (other than the family home) can also take longer to investigate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">The Deputy will be aware of the particular difficulties presented due to the huge rise in unemployment in the past 18 months or so and the pressure this has brought to bear on the network of local offices and in the inspectorate. To alleviate some of this pressure since May 2008, some 400 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new Central Support Units and the Departments Inspectorate. At the same time the Department has been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising scheme controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">One of these streamlining initiatives, which is being trialled at present, relates to customers who are applying for jobseeker's allowance on the termination of their jobseeker's benefit entitlement. In any of these cases where there are no elements of self-employment or property involved in the means assessment, the person will self-certify the various components of their means and a decision will be made by the Deciding Officer without the need to refer the claim to an Inspector. As a control measure a certain proportion of these claims will be selected at random and will be referred to an inspector for verification of the declaration of means. It is expected that this initiative will be rolled out to the network of local offices in the coming months.  In the State Pension Non-Contributory area a desk assessment process has been introduced whereby claims are processed and decided based on the information provided by the customer on their application form. This initiative has removed the requirement on Social Welfare Inspectors to investigate all claims and has led to a reduction in processing times for claims received under the scheme. Over the past year some 40% of all claims for State Pension have been fully processed by desk assessment. It is hoped to extend this initiative to other means-tested schemes.  Anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance from the Community Welfare Officer which is subject to a means test and other qualifying condition.</p>

            <p eId="para_1905">There are currently some 25,963 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment.  In 2009 the Department received 46,542 new and renewal FIS claims compared to 42,940 in 2008 and 37,861 in 2007 — an increase of over 8% on 2008 and over 22% on 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906">With regard to the level of take up, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements.  Accordingly the department completed a research project in 2008 to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">This research project included a survey of over 3,000 families which appeared to satisfy conditions for receipt of FIS.  From over 1,000 valid responses received the survey identified that only 23% might actually be eligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">The research also found that overall awareness of Family Income Supplement<b> </b>among potential recipients is high with nearly three in four claiming to have heard of the scheme.  Despite high levels of awareness, there was a lack of awareness and understanding of the eligibility requirements with only one in three claiming to be aware of the qualifying criteria for FIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">The report recommends that the Department needs to ensure that information about the scheme is advertised in a focused way with the eligibility and qualification criteria communicated as clearly as possible.  The Department is addressing this by ensuring such information is highlighted as part of its ongoing information strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1911">Spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to meeting some of the general criteria outlined as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">There is a written partnership agreement</p>
            <p eId="para_1913">Each partner writes cheques on the business accounts in their own right</p>
            <p eId="para_1914">There is a joint business account</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">It is apparent to those doing business with the partnership that a partnership exists</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">Business accounts and activities are in joint names of the partners</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">Each partner makes a significant contribution to the running of the business</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">The business is owned jointly by the partnership</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">The profits and losses of the partnership are shared by each partner</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">The business stationery reflects the existence of a partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">Applications received in Scope Section are forwarded to Social Welfare Inspectors who interview the parties concerned and report back to Scope Section. A Deciding Officer subsequently issues a formal decision on whether a partnership exists or not. To date, of 579 applications finalised, 508 cases have been approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">When approved, both spouses may incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI contributions and must discharge their liability before the contributions can be awarded. The person(s) concerned can then apply for pension or benefit in the normal way. Widows and widowers can qualify for one of a number of different schemes depending on their particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">The widow(er)'s contributory pension is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or that of the deceased spouse and, therefore, there are no disqualifications from entitlement to pension where relevant PRSI contribution conditions are satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">In relation to the widow's contributory pension, the pension is automatically awarded, provided all other qualifying conditions are satisfied, where the late spouse was in receipt of either a state pension (transition or contributory) which included an increase for a dependent spouse (or would have but for the fact that the spouse was in receipt of state pension non-contributory, blind pension or carer's allowance).</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">While there are no plans to further ease the qualifying conditions at present, any further reforms to the state pension (contributory) will be addressed in the forthcoming national pensions framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">To qualify for a state pension (contributory), a number of minimum qualifying conditions must be met. A person must have at least 260 paid social insurance contributions, a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited since entry into social insurance, and must have entered social insurance at least 10 years before state pension age. In addition, self employed contributors must have a minimum of one year's paid self employed contributions before reaching age 66 and have all self-employed liability, payable by them paid. From 6 April 2012, a minimum of 520 paid contributions will be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">These conditions have been designed to ensure that those qualifying for payment have an adequate and sustained history of contributions to the social insurance fund over their working lives. The requirements for minimum pensions have been eased over the years and a number of special pensions were introduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1932">The Department's back to education programme includes the back to education allowance (BTEA) and the part-time education option (PTEO). The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not other wise be able to do so. The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for the scheme. In addition, an annual cost of education allowance of €500 is payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">In a joint initiative announced last year between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, 1,500 part-time undergraduate places and 1,000 part-time postgraduate places are being provided to people who are unemployed and on the live register for at least 6 months or have an entitlement to statutory redundancy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">A jobseeker who wishes to participate in a part-time course may do so under the Department's part-time education option (PTEO). Participants may continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements provided they continue to satisfy all the existing terms and conditions of their jobseeker scheme including availability for work. Approval to undertake a course must be obtained in advance from the local social welfare office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">Participation in a part-time course does not attract any increase in the rate of payment, a cost of education allowance or any extension of the payment period. A participant whose entitlement to jobseeker's benefit ceases during the period on the course is eligible to apply for jobseeker's allowance, entitlement to which is based on a means-test. Someone who qualifies for that allowance at reduced rate would therefore have existing assessable means. In such a case, the combination of the existing means and the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance awarded would normally exceed the rate payable to a participant who qualifies for maximum rate of jobseeker's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">The back to education programme will continue to be monitored in the light of changing economic circumstances to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_1938">Contributions due to the Social Insurance Fund are collected in the main by the Revenue Commissioners, together with income tax due. The Department's Inspectorate, appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 is responsible, inter alia, for ensuring that employers and self employed people comply with the Act in relation to Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">Employer compliance, in this regard is monitored through inspections which include detailed examinations of employers' records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all employees. In addition, any irregularity in a customer's PRSI record detected at claim processing stage or reported directly by the customer, is referred to the Inspectorate for follow up action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">The Department currently employs some 403 Social Welfare Inspectors throughout the country whose duties involve the investigation of eligibility to a broad variety of means tested schemes, as well as ensuring compliance by employers in regard to PRSI matters. Of the 403 Inspectors 86 are assigned to the Department's Special Investigation Unit and also work with the Revenue and the E.T. &amp; E. Inspectorate in carrying out joint investigations of employment records of employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">Employer inspections carried out by the Department's Inspectorate are comprehensive and involve:</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">detailed examination of employer records to ensure that accurate records of employees are being maintained and that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all their employees and that the correct PRSI class is being applied;</p>

            <p eId="para_1945">general advice and information to employers on matters such as the operation of the PRSI system, incentives available to employers, the correct classes of contributions, employees' entitlements etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">Where PRSI undercharges are established, the Inspector sets out PRSI arrears/underpayment in respect of each employee for each tax year and issues a demand to the employer for payment. Should the employer fail to respond satisfactorily, a statutory demand will issue by registered post and the employer given 14 days to respond. If the employer fails to respond the case is considered for prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">The Department is committed to delivering an effective and efficient regime of employer inspections, and ensuring that PRSI deductions and remittances are made in an accurate and timely manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_1951">The Department's role is to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs, both through their basic payments and through the fuel allowance scheme and the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">Fuel allowance is payable for 32 weeks a year. The standard allowance is €20 a week while the rate in smokeless zones is €23.90 a week.   The scheme benefits almost 318,000 people a year at an estimated cost of €217 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated cost of €200m in 2009.  The electricity allowance covers standing charges plus VAT and up to 2,400 units of electricity in each billing period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1955">The gas allowance covers a cash equivalent amount.  Up to 30% of customers availing of the electricity allowance consistently carry forward unused units to the next billing period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, administered by community welfare officers, can be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  Heating needs can also be met under the exceptional needs payments provisions of the scheme where a person is unable to meet such needs out of his/her resources.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">Since the onset of the adverse weather conditions, community welfare officers have provided assistance to people to purchase additional fuel, heaters and clothing and also towards the payment of heating bills and for repairs arising from burst pipes.  Over €72,000 has been paid out since 1 January 2010 in respect of such claims. Assistance will continue to be provided towards the payment of heating bills for those in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">The exceptional needs payments scheme is considered to be the appropriate response to heating needs arising from the recent cold weather.  Community welfare officers are best placed to deal with the situation having local knowledge and taking individual circumstances into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">An increase in the fuel allowance, irrespective of need, would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2019">I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 149 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2020">The Government at its meeting on 11 December 2009 agreed to the topics to be included in the questionnaire for the 2011 census.</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">As part of the preparatory work for the 2011 census the CSO conducted a public consultation by inviting members of the public and various interest groups to make submissions on the topics to be covered, and on the outputs to be produced.  A notice to this effect was published in the national press in September 2008 seeking submissions, and all government departments were contacted for their input.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">A Census Advisory Group was set up in Autumn 2008 to consider the submissions received and advise on the questions to be tested in a pilot survey planned to be carried out in April 2009. The Census Advisory Group was representative of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data along with the relevant CSO personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">Over 90 submissions covering 31 topics were received in total, among them submissions on the subject of disability, and in particular on the subject of autism. A specific sub-group was convened to consider the disability questions on the census form. This sub-group was composed of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The proposal to list specific disabilities within the disability question, namely to make specific reference to autistic spectrum disorder, or downs syndrome, in the category ‘A learning or intellectual disability' was considered at the second meeting of the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">The group concluded that it would not be appropriate, nor would there be enough room on the census form, to list all individual disabilities. However, in order to go some way towards accommodating this request the existing (2006) category ‘ <i>A learning or intellectual disability</i>’ was split into two categories ‘<i>An intellectual disability</i>’ and separately ‘<i>A difficulty with learning, remembering or concentrating</i>’ for testing in the pilot survey. The group felt that this approach narrowed the categories and thus helped address the issue of autism, while allowing the question to remain as inclusive as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">The new wording of the disability questions which were tested in the Census Pilot Survey in April 2009 were as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_2855">I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 148 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">The Government's Smart Economy Framework for sustainable economic renewal was produced in December 2008.  Implementation is the responsibility of relevant Ministers but is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal, which I chair. Some examples include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2857">market testing of the Innovation Fund proposed is currently being undertaken by the NTMA, testing the best way to design the Fund with venture capital companies and other stakeholders;</p>
            <p eId="para_2858">tax changes to support the Smart Economy include an improved R&amp;D tax credit, new tax arrangements for IP, tax incentives for start-up companies and to encourage venture capital companies to locate in Ireland;</p>
            <p eId="para_2859">the Innovation Alliance announced by Trinity and UCD to create a critical mass of  research activity and dramatically increase the commercialisation of research outputs;</p>
            <p eId="para_2860">major new technology initiatives to support the Smart Economy including, development of a new International Content Services Centre and making Ireland the leading location for energy efficient data centres, like the Microsoft Centre I opened last September;</p>
            <p eId="para_2861">a smart metering initiative is being rolled out and there is an electric vehicles plan to have 10% of all vehicles powered by electricity by 2020. Progress is also being made towards our ambitious renewable energy target of 40% by 2020, including investment in new ocean wave technology research;</p>
            <p eId="para_2862">the Green Enterprise Group has reported with detailed proposals for the creation of new jobs and businesses in the Greentech area. As a result of that report, we are pressing ahead with ideas like the Green IFSC and Green Enterprise Zones; and the home insulation initiative which delivered in over 30,000 homes in 2009 is being increased dramatically with new funding for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2863">a review of our Capital Programme to realign our capital investment — which is still over 5% of GNP — with the goals of the Smart Economy has been undertaken and as a result we will invest over €600m in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation this year, even at a time of great budgetary pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2864">The Smart Economy Framework is a comprehensive strategy, covering not just innovation and R&amp;D, but all aspects of our economic renewal strategy.  The Government expects to publish an overall progress report within the next month.  Responsibility for individual measures rests with relevant Ministers, to whom any specific questions should be directed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2874">Introduction of ‘Innovation Fund Ireland' is a commitment of <i>Building Ireland’s Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal</i>and the Renewed Programme for Government.  It aims to ensure greater availability of venture capital to help achieve our vision for transforming Ireland into the innovation and commercialisation hub of Europe by supporting innovative SMEs and help scale indigenous companies.  It is also an objective to use the Fund to help attract leading Venture Capital companies to locate their European operations here.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">Since the fund was announced the relevant Departments and Agencies have been working to design a detailed structure for establishing the Fund, which raises a number of complex issues which need to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">In particular, we want to ensure the design and operation of the Fund best reflects inputs from people with experience of venture capital markets, including the members of the Innovation Taskforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">As agreed in the recent programme for Government, market testing is underway to engage with potential participants amongst US and other relevant Venture Capital companies as well as other Stakeholders. This process which should be completed towards the end of this month will provide the basis for putting the most suitable legal and financial structures in place to operationalise the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">It is important to recognise that the Innovation Fund is just one aspect of the overall strategy to increase a world class innovation system, so it is important that it is brought forward as part of a coherent approach. For example, it will complement the existing seed and venture funds operated by Enterprise Ireland as well as the forthcoming Report of the Innovation Taskforce.</p>

            <p eId="para_3081">I propose to take Questions Nos. 153  and 154  together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">The basis of  the area classification used in the collection of Live Register data is the Department of Social and Family Affairs local office of registration.  The areas served by Local Employment Offices do not correspond to specific geographic boundaries.  Therefore, registrants at a given local office do not necessarily come from a particular region or area which can be precisely delineated.  For example, the figure for the Cork City Local Office of Registration refers to all persons signing on in the Cork city office but may include persons resident outside the boundaries of Cork City.  Consequently data from the Live Register are not considered to provide an exact breakdown of claimants by local authority administrative areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3083">The following table contains Live Register information for each local social welfare office in the counties and cities requested, with a breakdown by gender and the age group under 25 years.  For that age group, it should be noted that the Live Register includes only those aged 17 years and over.</p>

Following an open public tender the contract was awarded to a UK company, CACI UK Ltd in July 2009.

            <p eId="para_4323">While the decision of SR Technics to move operations from Ireland is regrettable, the relocation of companies, and with them jobs, is a reality of the modern global economic environment for a highly developed economy such as Ireland. This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all developed countries, not just Ireland.  It must be remembered that Ireland also experiences the benefits resulting from globalisation as new markets and business opportunities open up for Irish companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4324">The Government, through IDA Ireland, is committed to continued marketing of Ireland as a location for companies interested in establishing aircraft maintenance and aviation engineering businesses.  The decision by Aer Lingus to undertake line maintenance operations, previously contracted to SR Technics, is a commercial decision, which is solely a matter for Aer Lingus. As regards any financial assistance provided to a company for establishment of operations in Malta or any Member State, the application and monitoring of exemptions to the general prohibition on State Aid in the EC Treaty rests exclusively with the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_4325">The current Irish law in the area of "transfer of undertakings" is the <i>European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003</i> — Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 131 of 2003.  The Regulations implement the mandatory (i.e. mandatory to transpose) provisions of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger. Section 21 of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 transposed a provision of the European Directive relating to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4326">Complaints relating to alleged contravention of the Regulations on Transfer of Undertakings can be brought in the first instance to a Rights Commissioner and, on appeal, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  An application to a Rights Commissioner can be made by the employee, or by a representative (including a trade union representative) by contacting the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission, Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, or phone 01 6136700.</p>

These payments represent 80 % of total payments made by Departments; in value terms 91% were paid within 15 days.  A further 17% or almost 11,000 payments were made between 16 and 30 days and overall, 97% of payments during the period amounting to €1.86bn were paid within 30 days.  Although there was some variation between the performances of individual Departments, 5 Departments were paying in excess of 90% of invoices within 15 days, a further 7 Departments were paying in excess of 83% of invoices within 15 days, while the remaining three had paid almost 50% of their payments within 15 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_4337">Some 9 Departments had paid between 98% and 100% of their invoices within 30 days and a further 5 had paid between 93% and 96% of their invoices within 30 days, while the remaining Department had paid 87% of invoices within 30 days.  It is evident from the returns received, that Departments are playing their parts in assisting the cash flow of their suppliers, many of whom are Small and Medium Enterprises. The new procedures and processes introduced are having an impact in assisting Irish SMEs cash flow in the current difficult economic environment and I welcome this development.  Future quarterly returns will show the overall consistency of Departments in meeting the 15-day payment requirement and any changes in the performance of individual Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_4514">I can advise the Deputy that the position as outlined in the reply given on 17 September last remains largely unchanged.  As outlined at that time, following the successful appeal to the Supreme Court in this case, judgment was issued on 30th April 2009.  The final step in the legal process is the granting of a final perfected Order by the Supreme Court which the Court asked the Minister to prepare.  A draft Order has been prepared and is with the Office of the Chief State Solicitors Office for presentation to the Supreme Court.  The Order, when perfected, will contain the definitive list of the parties to whom the report may be circulated.  I am therefore not currently in a position to circulate this report until the Order has been perfected.  Upon delivery of the perfected Order, I will ensure that the contents of the report are promptly brought to the attention of the parties specified in the Order.</p>

            <p eId="para_4516">Some 1,056 civil servants are currently employed in my Department and the Offices under its aegis.  This equates to 988.98 in fulltime equivalent terms.  A number of the staff of my Department have studied economics, or economics-related subjects, prior to joining the Department. As my Department does not currently have a comprehensive record of the educational qualifications achieved by staff prior to joining the Department, I am not, therefore, in a position to answer the question fully at present.  However, it is envisaged that a comprehensive skills audit of the staff of my Department will be undertaken in the near future as part of the development of longer-term workforce planning in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4517">Information on the number of staff whose qualifications in economics were funded by my Department is given below.  In common with other Government Departments, my Department operates the Refund of Fees Scheme.  Under the Scheme, fees for approved courses of study undertaken by staff members in their own time are repaid on successfully completing their examinations.  Courses are approved based on their relevance to the business needs of the Department.  The number of staff currently working in the Department who have attained third-level qualifications in which economics formed part of the course of studies, and who were refunded their course fees by the Department is as follows:</p>

To date 8 staff have successfully completed the Diploma programme and 7 staff have completed the M Sc programme.  The Department also has access to considerable economic expertise through its Agencies such as Forfás, IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Economics is but one of the areas of expertise required to assist the Department to achieve its strategic mission.  Consequently, my Department has sponsored its staff to pursue relevant qualifications across the range of studies relevant to the work of the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_4527">The matter referred to in the Deputy's question is a call from the Restaurant Association of Ireland for the abolition of the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system and the reduction in the minimum wage in the Catering sector to €8.65 per hour.  The Government is committed to upholding the arrangements for the making of the Employment Regulation Orders under the  Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system. The Government has undertaken to provide for the modernisation of the existing system through the implementation of a series of measures, including the introduction of new legislation.  This commitment is being met within the framework of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 which has recently passed all stages in the Seanad.</p>
            <p eId="para_4528">It is the parties represented on a JLC that are best placed to address the impact of the economic crisis on employment levels and the viability of services in the relevant sector. This shared capacity for co-operation has already been demonstrated by the employer and trade union interest in the catering sector when agreement was reached in 2009 to fix a uniform set of terms and conditions in the sector, including the harmonisation of the Sunday premium to time plus one third.</p>
            <p eId="para_4529">I intend to bring forward proposals to include in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 a provision providing for the inclusion of an inability to pay provision in future Employment Regulation Orders.  I consider such a provision to be necessary in order to reconcile the current demands of both trade unions and employers through continuing to modernise and streamline the JLC system, while also alleviating the pressures that employers facing financial difficulty currently experience.  The final details of this provision have still to be settled and I intend to introduce an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil to give effect to this objective.</p>

The results of this survey are released each January. In 2009 total employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Meath was 3,787.  Enterprise Ireland does not collect statistics on employment by job description, and employment numbers are collected on a county basis only.

            <p eId="para_4607">The Forfás Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are supported by the industrial development agencies.  Data is compiled on an annualised basis and is aggregated at county level.  Therefore, information on individual locations or breakdown by job description is not available.  As companies provide data on a confidential basis, for statistical purposes only, information on individual companies is not disclosed for reasons of client confidentiality.  Details of the number of IDA supported jobs created in County Louth, for the period in question is set out in the following tabular statement.</p>

The results of this survey are released each January. In 2009 total employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Louth was 4,541.

         asked the

         when a person (details supplied) in County Offaly will expect to receive their state redundancy payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4683">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4684">I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 15 September 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  This claim awaits processing.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from April 2009 and those filed online from May 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4685">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for 2009 of 77,001. This figure exceeds the claims lodged for 2008 (40,607) by 90% and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_4686">Measures already taken include: the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5.  There has also been the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), with the centre having received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments; the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website; engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and  we are currently looking at ways in which additional resources can be allocated to the area in the first quarter of 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4689">Enterprise Ireland is the lead government agency responsible for the development of indigenous enterprise.  It supports companies employing 10 or more people and start-up companies which have the potential to employ 10 or more people and reach or exceed €1m in exports over three years.  Enterprise Ireland offers a comprehensive range of services, including both financial and non-financial supports, to companies with a business strategy that encompasses the elements required for business success.</p>
            <p eId="para_4690">Enterprise Ireland has been very active in the digital sector through ongoing funding support for third level institutions, start-up companies and also established and scaling companies.  Enterprise Ireland has labelled the digital sector TIME (Telecom Internet Media and Edutainment).  The sector consists of approximately 350 EI client companies and growing.  Approximately 60 companies have a high profile having closed significant deals (between €200k and €12m) with telecom operators, such as Telefonica, Sprint and Vodafone and also with media/entertainment companies including Nickelodeon, CBBC, Disney and Facebook.  The establishment of Facebook's European headquarters here in Ireland, follows the positive trend set by Google, Microsoft, eBay and Intel.</p>
            <p eId="para_4691">In relation to developing a hub for game development, Enterprise Ireland has funded or co-funded the majority of incubator/hub space in Ireland for early stage business.  Incubator space for start-ups in the Gaming/Entertainment sector is focused in Dublin and provided by the Digital Depot located in Thomas St and Media Cube in Dun Laoghaire's Institute of Art, Design and Technology.  Both centres provide spaces for over 50 digital related companies.  Other incubator centres around Ireland have assisted in developing successful digital companies over the last number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4692">However, while the prospect of a dedicated hub focused on just gaming/entertainment has been investigated, the Digital Hub approach appears to be the preferred approach at the moment.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to monitor and influence changes in strategic focus of the digital hubs as new business models emerge.  Enterprise Ireland's new Software Strategy document (launched in 2009) has highlighted the importance of specific clusters with internet/gaming clusters as one of the clusters highlighted for growth.  Enterprise Ireland continues to support the games sector in Ireland and actively engages with the companies involved with regard to clustering and sectoral development.</p>

            <p eId="para_4696">My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_4697">Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4698">However, I would stress that priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_4699">In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available to them the company are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their business needs with the relevant staff of the Board.

            <p eId="para_4701">As stated in my previous reply, IDA Ireland continues to actively promote the Waterford region to overseas investors.  Currently there are 31 IDA Ireland supported companies in Waterford City and County employing approximately 5,960 people. Clear evidence of a transition to more knowledge based and higher value activity is seen in the resilience of companies such as Bausch &amp; Lomb, Honeywell, and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as newer additions to the county's portfolio, such as Citi Hedge Fund Services, Genzyme and Sun Life Financial.</p>
            <p eId="para_4702">Key interventions in support of attracting investment in recent years have been the development of the Waterford Business &amp; Technology Park (28 hectares), the Dungarvan Business Park (additional 14 hectares developed) and a large scale 55 hectare Greenfield site in Belview, specifically targeted for larger scale utility intensive overseas investments. A further 20 hectare site (Knockhouse lands) adjacent to the Genzyme facility on the Kilmeaden road in Waterford City is also available for Greenfield investment.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland and the Cork County Enterprise Board offer a range of supports to businesses to facilitate them in the creation and retention of jobs, and to assist those wishing to start their own business.</p>

            <p eId="para_4706">The protections afforded consumers in circumstances where they purchase goods which turn out to be faulty are set out in the Sale of Goods legislation, principally the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, and also in the European Communities (Certain Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 11/2003 refers).  The essential protection provided in Irish law in cases of breaches of a condition under a sales contract, such as instances concerning the sale of faulty goods, entitles a consumer to reject the goods and repudiate the contract. Where the consumer has paid for the goods then he or she may sue for damages and /or seek recovery of the price paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_4707">Notwithstanding the essential right of consumers to reject faulty goods and seek recovery of the price paid, provisions were inserted into the Sale of Goods legislation allowing consumers who purchase goods which turn out to be faulty a choice of remedies. This choice affords the consumer the opportunity on the one hand to seek a remedy to the fault or a replacement of the goods whilst still retaining the entitlement to reject the goods or have them repaired elsewhere where the seller fails or refuses to facilitate the request. In practical terms the consumer is afforded the right to "cure" the defect without losing the right to reject. Thus the consumer has a second chance to reject where the seller fails to facilitate the request for repair or replacement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4708">Insofar as the European Communities (Certain Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees) Regulations 2003 are concerned, these Regulations added a broader dimension to the palate of remedies available to Irish consumers. It is important to point out, however, that these remedies are in addition to and not in substitution for the protections afforded consumers under the Sale of Goods legislation. The Regulations essentially require that goods delivered under a contract of sale to a consumer must be in conformity with that contract. The Regulations provide that goods are in conformity with the contract for sale if they comply with the description given by the seller, are fit for the purposes for which such goods are normally used, demonstrate the quality and performance which are normal in goods of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect etc. The Regulations further provide that where there is a lack of conformity in relation to a contract for the sale of goods, the seller shall be liable to the consumer for any lack of conformity and that the consumer is entitled to a range of remedies, including that the goods are brought into conformity, free of charge, by repair or replacement, or an appropriate reduction is made in the price, or the contract is rescinded with regard to those goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_4709">As regards the suggestion that there is a 30 day limit on vendors' liability in respect of refunds, I am not aware of the provenance of that suggestion. It may be that the 30 day limit may refer to the returns policy operated by some retailers, whereby they allow consumers to return goods, which are not faulty, within a particular period subject to certain conditions. I would wish to assure the Deputy, however, that there is no such limit in relation to the statutory protections afforded consumers in instances where they purchase goods which turn out to be faulty, indeed any policy which would seek to limit those protections would not be binding on the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4710">I am satisfied, therefore, that the information campaign being run by the National Consumer Agency is not misleading and indeed is providing useful and timely advice to consumers as to their rights in instances where they purchase goods which turn out to be faulty.</p>

            <p eId="para_4714">As part of Budget 2010 a number of savings were identified in relation to Community Employment (CE).  These changes were mainly in the area of training allowances that are linked to Social Welfare payments and certain FÁS Allowances that are provided in addition to the core training allowances.  The FÁS training allowance for Community Employment and Job Initiative participants has been reduced from €24.40 and €48.80 per week to €20 and €40 per week respectively.  In addition, new entrants to FÁS training programmes will only be paid an allowance if they had been entitled to Job Seekers Allowance or Job Seekers Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4715">The funding in respect of training and materials for those on CE programmes will be reduced from €1,500 to €750 per head per annum.  These savings will allow for an increase of 500 CE places bringing the total number of places available to 23,300. The changes in CE do not have implications for the Rural Social Scheme which is under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4716">This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4749">Responsibility in relation to the negotiation of commercial contracts between parties such as retailers and suppliers is essentially a matter for the contracting parties themselves. It should be appreciated that such negotiations are not homogenous in their nature and reflect the fact that considerations may apply in relation to negotiations between a supplier and a particular retailer that do not apply in relation to negotiation between that supplier and another retailer. Such considerations would include issues such as volume discounts etc. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the fact that a supplier and a retailer may agree to contract for the supply of goods at a particular price does not necessarily mean that price will apply in respect of every negotiation between the supplier and other retailers for the supply of those goods given the variants that apply in relation to different negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4750">In so far as competition law has an effect on business relationships in the grocery goods sector, Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 and Article 101 of the Treaty prohibit agreements, decisions and concerted practices that have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.  Anti-competitive practices such as price fixing, limiting or controlling production and markets, market sharing, applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties (thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage) and making the conclusion of contracts subject to the acceptance of supplementary obligations are specifically prohibited.</p>
            <p eId="para_4751">However certain agreements or concerted practices entered into between two or more undertakings operating at different levels of the production or distribution chain, which relate to the conditions under which the parties may purchase, sell or resell certain goods or services within the State may fall outside the scope of Section 4 or Article 101. For example, non-exclusive distribution agreements whereby the supplier agrees with the buyer to supply the contract goods or services to the buyer for a certain territory but without any restriction on supplying other buyers within that territory are deemed to be outside the scope of section 4.  It is also the case that certain agreements and practices can avail of a block exemption from competition rules, others require assessment on a case by case basis while hard-core anti-competitive practices (e.g. price fixing) is always prohibited.</p>
            <p eId="para_4752">Section 5 of the Act 2002 and Article 102 of the Treaty prohibits abuse of a dominant position.  The creation or existence of a dominant position does not breach competition law, rather it is the abuse of that position that constitutes the breach.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 strengthens the provisions of the 2002 Act by prohibiting practices such as: the imposition of resale price maintenance in regard to the supply of grocery goods (resale price maintenance is the practice whereby manufacturers or suppliers specify the minimum prices at which their goods may be resold); unfair discrimination in regard to the supply of grocery goods. This is a reference to a supplier offering preferential terms to one buyer over another even though the transactions involved are equivalent in nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_4753">The legislation outlined above provides for the investigation of a breach by the Competition Authority and for prosecution on indictment by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which the Deputy will be aware are both independent bodies in the exercise of their statutory functions. Alternatively, aggrieved suppliers may take a private action for relief by way of injunction, declaration or damages including exemplary damages.  Depending on the specific details of any individual case the EU Commission may also have a role.</p>
            <p eId="para_4754">With regard to the practices referred to in the Deputy's question, there may be jurisdictional considerations given that the practices may have a cross border dimension. I would urge the Deputy to bring any details of the practices concerned to the attention of the Competition Authority in order that the relevant competition body can be identified to follow up on the matter and to investigate if the said practices are in conformity with the provisions of competition law.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4757">I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 192 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4758">Since the announcement of the DELL and related redundancies in Raheen in January 2009, FÁS has already provided guidance service and training courses to over 1,500 workers made redundant. Enterprise Ireland and the local Vocational Education Committees also continue to promote and offer their business advice, grant aid and educational services.  A number of affected workers have already enrolled on training courses and in further and third level education at institutions in the Mid-West region to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4759">The application for co-funded assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) towards the costs of a personalized package of occupational guidance, training, employment, entrepreneurship and educational measures for workers made redundant at the DELL plant in Raheen, Co. Limerick, and in ancillary enterprises, was made by my Department in mid-June 2009. It was subsequently approved by the European Union budgetary authorities in late December 2009. The transfer of EU funds is anticipated later this month. Provision has been made in my Department's Vote for the national financing element required. The timeframe permitted for eligible expenditure under the Fund is 24 months from the date of submission of an application, or from the date of commencement of relevant measures provided this is no later than 3 months after the application's submission. As such in the case of the DELL related application the latest date for expenditure is September 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4760">My Department will be the managing authority for EGF funding in the State while the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and Enterprise Ireland will be designated intermediate bodies for funds transfer, reporting and monitoring purposes. Approved funding will be made available to public beneficiaries delivering services on the ground to the eligible redundant workers. All intermediate bodies shall certify expenditure in their particular area of responsibility and report to my Department. All relevant EU and national accounting and auditing procedures and requirements must be adhered to by the relevant intermediate bodies and public beneficiaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4761">It is imperative that the wide range of measures being provided to eligible redundant workers is co-ordinated in the most effective and efficient manner locally and regionally.  To that end, I have charged FÁS to establish a dedicated EGF Co-ordination Unit in Limerick to ensure that all relevant supports across all service providers are coordinated on the ground in a timely, effective and efficient manner. The Unit shall act as the primary coordination agency for the Department in the implementation of the EGF programme for DELL worker related supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_4762">The EGF Co-Ordination Unit is now contacting all potential beneficiaries of the Fund from DELL and the other ancillary enterprises to outline the supports on offer. They are also inviting the workers to a 2 days information fair in Limerick early next month at which all service providers will be in attendance to explain their programmes and supports, to answer queries and to provide for course registrations.  In parallel, a steering group is being established to include worker representative bodies in order to ensure that the views of the redundant workers and other key stakeholders are made known and fed into the implementation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4763">The Minister for Labour Affairs will be meeting the DELL Redundant Workers Association as part of this process in the coming days.  A review of the operation of the Fund shall be undertaken by the Department in June 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4768">The wide range of recommendations in the Mid-West Task Force report cover both local and national issues.  In that respect, the Government has been responding to the economic downturn generally and has taken numerous initiatives, for example in relation to competitiveness and cost competitiveness, industrial employment stabilization, and employment activation measures. All of these measures have benefited regions affected by or threatened with job losses, including the Mid West region. Workers in the Mid West are the subject of a substantial package assembled by the Government in response to the redundancies arising from developments at Dell in Limerick and knock-on effects in other companies in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_4769">In addition, the State agencies IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the County Enterprise Boards have redoubled their efforts to stimulate industrial employment in the Mid West region. For example, IDA is supporting eight industrial projects with a job potential of 1,073 which were announced by multinational companies in the Mid West in 2008 and 2009 and are now being brought into operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4770">The measures mentioned above are outlined more fully in an initial response to its recommendations which I sent to the Task Force in late September. Given the wide range of recommendations in the report, I have also brought the report to the attention of my colleagues in Cabinet and it is currently being further considered in a number of other Government Departments as well as in my own Department following the recent budget. I am very grateful for the work Mr Brosnan and the other members of the Task Force have undertaken to date. I shall continue to keep the Task Force informed on the Government's work on matters covered in the interim recommendations. The Task Force has identified a number of issues for further study in its Final Report which I look forward to receiving in the coming months.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_4772">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">Budget 2010 contained some changes to Community Employment Schemes however, the qualifying criteria and rules for participation remain unchanged.  A number of savings were identified, mainly in the area of training allowances that are linked to Social Welfare payments and certain FÁS Allowances that are provided in addition to the core training allowances.  The FÁS allowance for CE and JI participants will reduced from €24.40 and €48.80 per week to €20 and €40 per week respectively.  In addition, new entrants to FÁS training programmes will only be paid an allowance if they had been entitled to Job Seekers Allowance or Job Seekers Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">The funding in respect of training and materials for those on CE programmes will be reduced from €1,500 to €750 per head per annum.  These savings will allow for an increase of 500 CE places bringing the total number of places available to 23,300.  A person can remain on a CE Scheme for longer than 3 years if they are aged 55 years or over.  In addition persons in receipt of the following disability-linked Social Welfare payments may be eligible for an additional 1 year's participation: Disability Allowance; Blind Pension; Invalidity Pension; Illness Benefit for 6 months or more.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_4783">The current Irish law in the area of "transfer of undertakings" is the <i>European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003</i> — Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 131 of 2003.  The Regulations implement the mandatory (i.e. mandatory to transpose) provisions of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger. Section 21 of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 transposed a provision of the European Directive relating to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4784">Complaints relating to alleged contravention of the Regulations on Transfer of Undertakings can be brought in the first instance to a Rights Commissioner and, on appeal, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Any such case should be taken within six months of the date on which an employee considers that there has been a contravention of the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations. I understand that no complaint has been made to the Rights Commissioners Service in relation to this case.  In accordance with the Transfer of Undertaking Regulations, it would be a matter for a Rights Commissioner to determine in law if any particular case does, in fact, constitute a transfer of undertakings situation. Thus, the circumstances of each individual case would have to be considered by a Rights Commissioner, in the first instance, in the light of all previous case law including European Court of Justice case law.</p>
            <p eId="para_4785">An application to a Rights Commissioner can be made by the employee, or by a representative (including a trade union representative) by contacting the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission, Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, or phone 01 6136700.</p>

            <p eId="para_4787">As the Deputy will be aware I have directed my Department to extend the scope of the reviews of the existing legislation relating to industrial and provident societies (co-operative societies) and friendly societies to include the functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Trade Union Acts.  The Deputy may also be aware that the McCarthy report made a recommendation in relation to the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and this too is being taken into consideration in the context of the reviews.</p>
            <p eId="para_4788">Our trade union legislation is very much based on the UK Acts, the principal Act being a UK Act of 1871, and whilst there have been some amending Acts in the intervening years the basic registry functions have remained relatively similar in the two jurisdictions.  I would anticipate, insofar as the review of the legislation will consider the functions of the Registrar under the Trade Union Acts, that it will have due regard to the functions discharged by comparable regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions, in particular the UK, given the historic linkages.</p>

I can confirm that my Department received statutory lump sum claims for the individuals concerned and some former employees of the company on 26 November 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.

In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4838">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.

This figure exceeds the claims lodged for 2008 (40,607) by 90% and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_4839">Measures already taken include the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5; the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments.  There has also been the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website and engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.  The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and  we are currently looking at ways in which additional resources can be allocated to the area in the first quarter of 2010.</p>

My officials endeavour to process all claims as quickly as possible and claims are dealt with in order of date of receipt.  Current processing times indicate that the individual's claim should be paid by end February/beginning of March, however my Department is constantly endeavouring to achieve earlier completion and payment dates.</p>

            <p eId="para_5249">The Deputy must bear in mind that the emissions from the transport sector account for around 30% of non-ETS emissions.  The carbon tax is about sending price signals to the sector as a whole.  The carbon tax does not differentiate between private and public transport per se, however, the impact on public transport will be far less than on private transport by virtue of the fact that the higher cost of fuel is dispersed amongst more people, for example, using a bus compared to an individual in a car.  Consequently, the carbon tax will be proportionately less for users of public transport which should be an incentive for its use.  In addition, the carbon tax provides an incentive for both private motorists and providers of public transport to invest in fuel efficient cars and buses when they are making future purchasing decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5250">It should also be noted that the Government has invested record levels of public funds in developing transport infrastructure and services over the last decade.  In particular, under Transport 21, over €3bn has been invested in public transport since 2006.  In rural areas, in addition to the provision of more buses for Bus Éireann, the Rural Transport Programme funding has more than doubled since 2005, and funding levels in 2010 is being be protected at that provided in 2009 (€11m).</p>

            <p eId="para_5258">I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 to 219, inclusive, together.   Secretaries-General are appointed for not more than 7 years and are obliged to retire at 60 years of age.   If, on appointment as Secretary, a person is between 56 and 60 years of age, the Government may, at its discretion, (a) waive that person's obligation to retire at 60 and (b) permit the person to serve as Secretary for a period not exceeding 4 years in any case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5259">In the case of a Secretary-General appointed for not more than seven years, who has served a term of office before reaching 60, the Government should then formally decide on one of the following courses: to appoint him or her to an appropriate position (carrying the same remuneration) elsewhere in the civil service; to arrange for such an appointment (in agreement with the officer) in another area of the public service or in an international institution; to allow him or her to opt for early retirement on a voluntary basis with immediate pension and lump sum and a special severance gratuity of one half of annual salary on the term specified in Sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963.</p>

            <p eId="para_5342">I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 232 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5343">The Government has set out a multi-annual framework to restore sustainability to the public finances and to reduce the General Government Deficit to below 3% of GDP by end-2014. Over the course of 2008 and 2009 the Government has already taken significant action on curbing expenditure and raising revenue. Budget 2010 represented a further phase in the consolidation of the public finances and as I outlined in my statement on Budget day, taking account of the fact that there had already been tax increases in the previous two budgets, a limit had been reached and job creation would be impacted by further increasing the penalty on work and investment. Consequently, Budget 2010 delivered an adjustment of €4 billion (2½% of GDP) for 2010. The adjustment mainly focused on reducing expenditure, including measures to further reduce the public sector pay bill, reduce Social Welfare spending and also to reduce other Departmental spending including an adjustment on capital expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5344">The measures taken to date by the Government, including those in Budget 2010, have been welcomed by the EU Commission and the European Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_5345">On foot of these measures it is forecast that the General Government Deficit will stabilise in 2010 at the 2009 level. Failing to stabilise the deficit in 2010 and to progressively reduce it to below the Stability and Growth Pact limit by 2014 would necessitate further increases in borrowing. This would in turn lead to an unsustainable rise in our debt servicing costs. Debt servicing costs have a first call on available resources, therefore an increase in these costs impacts on the resources available for other priorities. This serves to underline the ongoing importance of the corrective measures to be introduced in the period to 2014 and the Government is determined to take the necessary action as set out in Budget 2010.</p>

The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a limited effect on tourist numbers. The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_5364">We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment. I have no plans to abolish the air travel tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_5371">Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a scheme of tax relief for donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies. The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations vary depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person subject to self-assessment or a company.</p>
            <p eId="para_5372">For PAYE-only taxpayers, the relief is given on a "grossed-up" basis to the approved body rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. The claim is therefore made to the Revenue Commissioners by the approved body. In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis, the individual claims the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense and there is no grossing up arrangement</p>
            <p eId="para_5373">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, because of the different arrangements, as outlined above, for claiming the tax relief and the fact that the records maintained by them do not readily differentiate between the different types of charities and approved bodies availing of the relief, the detailed information sought by the Deputy cannot be easily compiled.</p>
            <p eId="para_5374">However, the following table sets out the estimated cost to the Exchequer of tax relief on donations to approved bodies and eligible charities, insofar as they are available, for the years 2007 and 2008. The figures shown for companies relate to accounting periods ending in 2007 and 2008. I am advised by Revenue that they are not yet in a position to provide data for 2008 in respect of self-employed donors, as all tax returns filed for that year have not yet been processed.</p>

            <p eId="para_5391">The Deputy will be aware that some difficult choices had to be made in framing recent Budgets. The Government has over the past 18 months made very significant budgetary adjustments including those announced on 9 December last. Those reductions had to be made in many areas, including reductions in Social Welfare expenditure, cuts in public service pay rates and the deferral, reduction or withdrawal of various schemes, to mention just a few.</p>
            <p eId="para_5392">Despite having to make those considerable reductions in other areas, I nevertheless, following requests from the drinks industry, decided to make reductions in alcohol excise duty. The reductions were designed to provide some relief to the business community, but represent a significant concession which is projected to cost the Exchequer some €90 million in a full year.  Consequently, to provide further relief to the drinks industry as is now being suggested is out of the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5393">In that regard, I would also point out that in my Budget speech, I stated that "I expect the drinks industry to play its part in making the cost of alcohol more competitive. There was no burden placed on traders to reduce prices immediately following Budget night. I would hope that those involved in the drinks industry would be able to find some arrangement with individual traders, and between the various sectors of the industry, to balance out any effects of the excise reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5394">I want to take this opportunity to re-confirm that the reductions in excise duty apply to stock taken out of bond on or after 10 December 2009, and that no compensation will be given by the Exchequer to traders in respect of stock purchased before 10 December 2009.</p>

        <b>Deputy Mary Upton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         the estimated saving that would occur from the standardisation of all pension tax reliefs at 20%; his views on the recent report by the Economic and Social Research Institute that showed that €8 out of every €10 of tax relief in this area goes to the top 20% of earners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5513">I assume that the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, that is, at the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5514">A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. The latest full historical data available in this regard is in respect of the tax year 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5515">There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about €500 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_5516">I assume that the ESRI Report referred to by the Deputy is that entitled Pension Policy: New Evidence on Key Issues published in November last.  The Report deals mainly with the question of whether existing tax incentives for private pension provision would be better targeted to encourage improved coverage by allowing relief on contributions at the standard income tax rate or at a hybrid rate of  30% rate. While apparently seeing merit in both approaches, the Report favours tax relief on pension contributions at the standard income tax rate in conjunction with sustaining the State Pension and schemes to increase pension coverage among lower to middle income earners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5517">The recently published Renewed Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a single 33% rate for tax relief on private pension provision in the context of the National Pensions Framework. This would result in a reduction in the tax relief on pension contributions available to higher rate taxpayers and an additional incentive to pension savings for standard rate taxpayers. However, the full detail and timing of the introduction of this measure have yet to be decided. I will bear the ESRI Report in mind  in the context of  delivering on the Government's commitment in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_5565">As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No 81 of 17 December 2009, the position is that a married one income couple benefit from a standard rate band of €45,400 which is €9,000 higher than the band for a single person.  They also have the benefit of the married person's credit in the amount of €3,660, which is double the single person's credit.  Where the stay-at-home spouse in a married one earner couple cares for a dependent person, e.g. their child or an elderly relative, the couple may benefit from an entitlement to the home carer tax credit, which has a value of €900.</p>
            <p eId="para_5566">The Commission on Taxation considered the issues associated with tax individualisation in its 2009 report.

            <p eId="para_5569">A tax credit of 25% of the incremental expenditure incurred by a company in an accounting period on Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities can be offset against a company's corporation tax liability.  Finance (No.2) Act 2008 contained a number of very significant enhancements to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme including: an option to carry-back unused tax credits for set-off against  a company's previous year's corporation tax payments, if there is insufficient corporate tax liability in the current year, thereby creating a tax refund;  a further option, if unused tax credits still remain, to claim payment of the remaining unused credits which will be paid in instalments over a 3 year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5570">Other positive changes made to the scheme in Budget 2009 and Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 include an increase in the rate of tax credit from 20% to 25% and the permanent setting of 2003 as the base year under the scheme. The scheme has been improved in most Budgets and Finance Acts since its introduction and the latest enhancements introduced in Budget 2009 and Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 will act to make the scheme one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_5571">There are difficulties in allowing companies to offset the R&amp;D tax credit against payroll taxes, not least the fact that these taxes are paid over to the Exchequer by companies on behalf of their employees on a fiduciary basis. Given the significant improvements already made to the scheme, notwithstanding the current difficult economic and fiscal environment which we face, I regret that I am not in a position at this time to agree to the suggestion contained in the details supplied with the question.</p>

            <p eId="para_5575">The definition of a public servant in the legislation governing the pension levy and the pay reductions is the same. Therefore, in general the reductions in pay under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 will apply to employees who are paying the pension related deduction. However, there are a small number of situations where the pay reductions could apply to a public servant who was not subject to the pensions levy. The pay reductions apply to employees of public service bodies, whether or not the public servant is a member of a public service pension scheme or receives a payment in lieu. Furthermore, the income exemption threshold that applies to the pensions levy does not apply to the pay reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5576">Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 apply to HSE service providers and other bodies in receipt of funding assistance from the HSE. Organisations that are directly funded by the HSE under Section 38<b> </b>of the 2004 Act are public service bodies, as defined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act which provided for the pension levy deduction and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, which provided for the reduction in public service pay. Employees in these bodies have access to public service pension schemes or, in a small number of cases, the state funds an employer contribution to a private pension scheme. The pension levy and the reduction in salary apply to all these employees. Accordingly, the pay reduction legislation applies to all members of the Nominated Health Agencies Superannuation Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5577">Under Section 39 of the 2004 Act, the HSE provides a grant towards the overall costs of running certain organisations.  Neither the pension levy nor the reduction in salary applies to such employees.</p>

            <p eId="para_5581">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners there is no register or list of so called ‘tax exiles' and there is nothing in Irish tax law that makes reference to ‘tax exile' status.</p>
            <p eId="para_5582">The taxation of individuals in the State is in line with that prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions, that is to say (a) individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes (based on the number of days presence in the State) are taxable here on their worldwide income; and (b) individuals who are not resident here for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and on income derived from working here.</p>
            <p eId="para_5583">I am informed by Revenue that for the 2007 tax year (the latest year for which figures are available), 7,228 non-resident individuals filed Irish tax returns in respect of their Irish-source income or income derived from working here.  The total amount of tax paid by these persons was €43m.  For the 2006 tax year, 5,993 non-resident individuals filed Irish tax returns in respect of their Irish-source income or income derived from working here.  The total amount of tax paid by these persons was €44.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_5584">The equivalent figures for 2008 are not yet available.  Returns for 2008 were due by 31 October 2009 or, in the case of returns made on ROS (Revenue Online System), by 16th November 2009. The data capture of information of these returns is currently under way and when completed will facilitate the compilation of statistics for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5585">Many of the individuals that show on their tax return that they are non-resident in the State do not have an Irish address.  It is not therefore possible to provide an analysis of the total number of persons claiming to be non-resident for tax purposes on a county basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5586">It should be noted that many of these non-residents are foreign nationals or have a foreign domicile; and many of the non-resident Irish citizens or Irish domiciliaries included in this figure may have become non-resident for reasons unrelated to taxation, but who may have retained Irish investments (such as rental property).  These individuals could not be categorised as ‘tax exiles' under any reasonable definition of that term.</p>

As soon as the error was identified, the recipients were notified by lunch-time on Friday 11 December 2009 and the communication was withdrawn.  The Revenue Commissioners also issued a clarification to all staff to the effect that there was no provision for the application of the reduced rates before midnight on 9 December; and that the previous rates of tax were to apply in all such cases. This clarification was also posted on the Revenue website. There is no provision in law to allow the refund of the difference in excise duty rates applicable pre- and post-Budget 2010.</p>

         his views on whether the VAT margin scheme that was introduced in budget 2010 imposes credit flow problems and cash flow problems on vendors of agricultural machinery, who heretofore traded via the special VAT scheme for used agricultural machinery; his further views on whether the new VAT margin scheme makes allowances for the seasonal nature of the agricultural machinery trade; if these considerations will be taken into account when structuring the Finance Bill 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5606">The VAT Margin Scheme was introduced on 1 January 2010 in respect of second-hand means of transport and agricultural machinery.  Under the Margin Scheme, dealers will account for VAT on their profit margin, that is, on the difference between the cost of acquiring the means of transport and agricultural machinery and its reselling price.  This will apply to all second-hand means of transport and agricultural machinery sold on or after 1 January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5607">Up to now all EU Member States applied the Margin Scheme to second-hand vehicles with the exception of Ireland and Denmark.  When the Margin Scheme was introduced under the EU VAT Directive in 1994, Ireland, following strong representations from the industry, negotiated a derogation in the form of the Special Scheme which applied up until December last, which is also provided for under the VAT Directive.  Introducing the VAT Margin Scheme brought Ireland into line with the vast majority of other Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_5608">Although under the new Margin Scheme dealers may experience a cash-flow change where they will be no longer entitled to claim VAT input on the purchase of a second-hand vehicle, this is being compensated for by appropriate transitional measures.  In this respect, second-hand vehicles or agricultural machinery acquired by dealers before 1 January 2010 and resold after 1 July 2009 are taxed on their resale price.  In effect this means that there will be no clawback of VAT in the case where such vehicles or agricultural machinery are sold at a loss.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">In addition, as part of the transition measures, for second-hand vehicles or agricultural machinery purchased from 1 January 2010, dealers will be entitled to claim VAT input credit on those vehicles for six months up to June 2010 at a reducing scale of 40% in the period January/February 2010, 30% in the period March/April and 20% in the period May/June.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">It should be noted, as already stated, that moving to the VAT Margin Scheme brings the VAT treatment of second-hand means of transport and agricultural machinery in the State into line with the treatment applying in the vast majority of other Member States.</p>

            <p eId="para_5613">I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 266 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5614">The remunerations packages of Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries in the civil service and related grades in other parts of the public service included a scheme of performance-related pay which gave an average payment of 10% of salary. The related grades in other areas of the public service include groups at comparable levels in the local authorities, HSE, some State Bodies, Garda Síochána and Defence Forces. In 2009, it was decided this scheme would be terminated subject to discussion on the implementation of the decision with the relevant staff association.</p>
            <p eId="para_5615">In applying the recent reductions in pay, I considered that account had to be taken of the reduction in remuneration for Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and related grades arising from the termination of the scheme of performance-related pay. Otherwise, the total reduction in remuneration for these grades would have been greater than those for other public servants including higher paid groups at the level of Secretary General or above. I decided that the reductions should comprise both a reduction in the salary scale and the termination of the scheme of performance-related pay previously payable to the grades. The resulting adjustments including the effect of the termination of the scheme of performance-related pay produce significant reductions in remuneration of 14% in the case of the grade of Deputy Secretary and 11.8% in the case of the grade of Assistant Secretary. These reductions are higher than those applying to other groups at lower salary levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_5616">As regards pensions, the arrangements applying to these grades in 2010 are the same as those applying to all public servants under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</p>

Accordingly it is not possible to give the assurance that the Deputy seeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5619">However, it may be helpful for the Deputy to note that, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that apart from the possibility that the goods were the produce of non-qualifying settlements, there are a number of other reasons why preference might not be claimed.  The goods may not qualify under the rules of origin in as much as that they may have been originally imported into Israel from another country or may have been manufactured in Israel using raw materials sourced in another country.  It may also be the case that, in the case of particular imports, claiming preference would have no impact on the duty payable and the importers saw no necessity or commercial benefit in claiming preference to which they had a technical entitlement.</p>

            <p eId="para_5627">The general policy is that public servants should not receive additional remuneration for undertaking other duties in the public service, such as acting as chairpersons or directors of State-sponsored bodies or serving on commissions or other such bodies.  The principle, usually referred to as the "one person one salary" principle, or OPOS, was first enunciated by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector in 1972, and it has been a feature of the public service since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_5628">The review body on higher remuneration in the public sector subsequently recommended that payment of fees could be sanctioned in exceptional circumstances.  This policy has been implemented on the basis that each of the following conditions must be met:</p>
            <p eId="para_5629">(1) that the duties involved are neither a part nor an extension of the officer's normal duties,</p>
            <p eId="para_5630">(2) that a rigid insistence on the principle of one person-one salary would deny scarce skills to the State,</p>

            <p eId="para_5632">(4) that the approval of the Department of Finance for additional payments is required in each case,</p>
            <p eId="para_5633">(5) that in no case should payment exceed the normal fee for the activity concerned, and</p>
            <p eId="para_5634">(6) that the duration of such payment should be limited to one term or five years whichever is greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_5635">Twenty one public servants received such a sanction in the years 2005 to 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5636">The personnel in question were five civil servants ranging in grade from clerical officer to assistant secretary, five employees of State bodies, four HSE staff, three local authority staff, two teachers and two lecturers.</p>

            <p eId="para_5687">In its report late last year, the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector concluded that the Constitution precluded them from recommending a reduction in judicial pay.  Had they not been so precluded, they would have considered a downward adjustment.  For the same reason the pension levy was not applied to the Judiciary, though many judges have contributed an amount on a voluntary basis.  As I indicated in budget 2010, the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the Courts have urged all judges to make appropriate voluntary contributions from salary in respect of the levy and I will make provision in the Finance Bill to facilitate these payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5688">I also indicated that since the review body would have considered a reduction of judicial salaries, I have decided that there will be no increase in judges' pay during the lifetime of this Government.  Future Governments may choose, as in the past, to continue this course of action.</p>

            <p eId="para_5690">Section 440 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a surcharge of 20% on any investment and rental income of a close company which is not distributed within 18 months of the end of the accounting period in which that income was earned.  Broadly, a close company is a company under the control of five or fewer participators (including associates), or of participators who are directors.  Most Irish owned companies are close companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5691">The purpose of the close company surcharge is to prevent avoidance of personal income taxation through the accumulation of income within a corporate structure.  With company profits subject to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax there would be a strong incentive, in the absence of a surcharge, for persons to earn and accumulate their income within a company and thereby avoid income tax at the higher 41% rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5692">Aside from the strong arguments for retaining the surcharge as an anti-avoidance measure, it would be invidious to remove or reduce the surcharge for particular sectors while retaining it for other sectors.  Moreover, such an approach would have State-aid implications from an EU perspective, in that it would favour certain companies and sectors here over others.  For these reasons, I would not propose to change the existing arrangements along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_5698">While the agencies involved are independent in carrying out their functions, I understand that the investigations are proceeding satisfactorily and that considerable resources are being committed to the investigations, with a view to bringing these to completion as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5699">In the case of the director of corporate enforcement, for example, considerable resources are committed to the investigations.  I am informed that the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank is a primary focus of ODCE work at this time.  I understand that some 16 full-time equivalent staff (or one-third of available personnel in the ODCE) are now supporting this investigation.  These staff include gardaí and staff with accounting, administrative, IT and legal expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_5700">However, investigations of this nature are by definition complex, and in particular the acquisition of potential evidence in such large-scale commercial investigations is a painstaking process.  It is, of course, essential that each investigation proceeds fully and comprehensively to conclusion so that any wrong doing identified at Anglo on foot of these investigations can be fully and appropriately pursued, in accordance with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_5701">The various regulatory bodies will make their reports in due course and I am of course anxious that these investigations are completed as swiftly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5705">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has advised that at end-2009 the national debt stood at €75.2 billion.  Some €71.5 billion was outstanding in medium and long-term liabilities and €9.3 billion in retail saving scheme products.  These amounts included a carryover of more than €5 billion in long-term funding available to finance the deficit in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5706">The NTMA has announced that it plans to raise up to €20 billion in the bond market in 2010 — this is significantly less than the €35.4 billion raised in long-term funding in 2009.  On 14 January last, the NTMA announced that it had raised €5 billion in a long-term syndicated bond issuance, this accounts for 25% of the funding programme for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5707">The spread over Germany which Ireland pays on its bonds is usually measured in terms of the ten year bond.  At end-2009 this spread narrowed to 1.45% compared to nearly 3% in March 2009.  The NTMA advise that at close of business on Friday, 15 January, the spread on the ten year bond was 1.56%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5708">The NTMA advise that at end-2009 approximately 95% of the national debt was subject to fixed interest rates.  The following table sets out the details in relation to the total medium and long-term debt that was outstanding at end-2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5755">I want to take this opportunity to re-confirm that the reductions in excise duty apply to stock taken out of bond on or after 10 December 2009, and that no compensation will be given by the Exchequer to traders in respect of stock purchased before 10 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5756">The Deputy will be aware that some difficult choices had to be made in framing recent budgets.  The Government has over the past 18 months made very significant budgetary adjustments including those announced on 9 December last.  Those reductions had to be made in many areas, including reductions in social welfare expenditure, cuts in public service pay rates and the deferral, reduction or withdrawal of various schemes, to mention just a few.</p>
            <p eId="para_5757">Despite having to make those considerable reductions in other areas, I nevertheless, following requests from the drinks industry, decided to make reductions in alcohol excise duty.  The reductions were designed to provide some relief to the business community, but represent a significant concession which is projected to cost the Exchequer some €90 million in a full year.  Consequently, to provide further relief to the drinks industry as is now being suggested is out of the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5758">In that regard, I would also point out that in my budget speech, I stated that "I expect the drinks industry to play its part in making the cost of alcohol more competitive.  If I find this reduction has not been passed on to the consumer I will reverse today's reduction".  There was therefore no burden placed on traders to reduce prices immediately following budget night.  I would hope that those involved in the drinks industry would be able to find some arrangement with individual traders, and between the various sectors of the industry, to balance out any effects of the excise reductions.</p>

            <p eId="para_5776">The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III provides for the reduced rate of VAT to be applied to children's car seats, it does not provide for the reduced rate to be applied to road safety products in general, which are subject to the standard VAT rate of 21%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5777">Regarding children's car safety seats, in Budget 2007 Ireland availed of the option under Annex III to apply the reduced rate of 13.5% to these products with effect from 1 July 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5778">In relation to amending Annex III, the Deputy will be aware that this could only be done in the context of an overall review at Community level of reduced rates.  In May 2009, EU Council Minister's adopted a proposal to slightly expand the list of goods and services to which a reduced rate can apply under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. The proposal primarily concerned reduced VAT rates for locally supplied labour intensive services, including housing, restaurant and catering services.  The proposal does not, however, include road safety equipment in general in Annex III.  In this context, it remains not possible for Ireland to apply a reduced rate to road safety products in general.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
            <p eId="para_5790">I would like to take this opportunity to update the Deputy on my remarks to the House on November 24th, 2009 during the severe flooding that affected certain parts of the country at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5791">Since I spoke on that occasion, the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to address the situation. The most pressing issue at the time was to provide assistance to those immediately affected and also to assist the Local Authorities in the post-flood clean-up. An initial sum of €10m was provided for a Humanitarian Aid Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to alleviate the hardship caused. The Government also indicated that further funding would be made available, if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5792">A further €2m was allocated for a targeted Fodder Aid Scheme to assist farmers who were experiencing a fodder shortage, which might have led to financial hardship and potential animal welfare issues on affected farms.</p>
            <p eId="para_5793">Funding of €14m was provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the post-flood clean-up by Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5794">In addition to these immediate initiatives, the Government has allocated €50m for flood risk management activities for 2010, which is administered by the Office of Public Works. This increased allocation will allow OPW to extend the number of Capital Works schemes already underway throughout the country. Within the overall allocation, I have also announced an increase for Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works to be undertaken by Local Authorities in 2010. This Programme, which I initiated in 2009, has been increased initially to €6m and is to cater for works or studies which can be completed in 2010. OPW is currently seeking applications from Local Authorities and when the applications are received and evaluated the allocation may be reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5795">OPW has undertaken a rigorous collection of data and information since the November 2009 floods and has already met with several local authorities to review the recent flood events and identify actions required. This may well lead to further areas where works can be undertaken by OPW, in addition to the major schemes already under construction in Clonmel, Co Tipperary; Mallow, Co. Cork; Fermoy, Co. Cork; Ennis, Co. Clare;  Mornington, Co. Meath; and the River Dodder in Dublin, and the schemes at various stages of development which include Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Templemore, Co. Tipperary, Bray and Arklow, Co. Wicklow amongst others.</p>
            <p eId="para_5796">As the Deputy may be particularly interested in the River Shannon area, I can confirm that the Shannon Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study will be commissioned in mid-2010. This will identify the level of flood risk in the catchment as well as a prioritised plan of measures to address the risks identified. The study will involve all of the main stakeholders who have a role in the management of the Shannon, with a view to ensuring that all flood risk factors are managed in a co-ordinated way. Included in the Study will be the area of Ballinasloe which has been subjected to severe flooding since November. OPW has already met the local authority to identify interim measures to mitigate the flood risk in the town, and I met with them myself yesterday, 18 January, in Ballinasloe.</p>
            <p eId="para_5797">Finally, I would like to like to confirm that tender documents for the procurement of consultants to undertake a National Flood Warning System are currently being finalised with the relevant stakeholders and will issue shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_5799">The Deputy will be aware that some difficult choices had to be made in framing recent Budgets. The Government has over the past 18 months made very significant budgetary adjustments including those announced on 9 December last. Those reductions had to be made in many areas, including reductions in Social Welfare expenditure, cuts in public service pay rates and the deferral, reduction or withdrawal of various schemes, to mention just a few.</p>
            <p eId="para_5800">Despite having to make those considerable reductions in other areas, I nevertheless, following requests from the drinks industry, decided to make reductions in alcohol excise duty. The reductions were designed to provide some relief to the business community, but represent a significant concession which is projected to cost the Exchequer some €90 million in a full year.  Consequently, to provide further relief to the drinks industry as is now being suggested is out of the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5801">In that regard, I would also point out that in my Budget speech, I stated that "I expect the drinks industry to play its part in making the cost of alcohol more competitive. If I find this reduction has not been passed on to the consumer I will reverse today's reduction". There was therefore no burden placed on traders to reduce prices immediately following Budget night. I would hope that those involved in the drinks industry would be able to find some arrangement with individual traders, and between the various sectors of the industry, to balance out any effects of the excise reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5802">I want to take this opportunity to re-confirm that the reductions in excise duty apply to stock taken out of bond on or after 10 December 2009, and that no compensation will be given by the Exchequer to traders in respect of stock purchased before 10 December 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5854">The Government has taken numerous measures to ensure the continued stability of the Irish financial system: the Guarantee scheme, nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, recapitalisations and NAMA.  These measures have facilitated continued lending to SMEs.  Indeed, the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland in February 2009 specifically encompassed commitments from the banks to provide additional capacity for SME lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_5855">The initial Independent Review of Credit Availability conducted by Mazars did not recommend the establishment of a risk sharing structure but rather that such a structure be considered.  Risk sharing was assessed and it was clear that there were considerable obstacles to that approach, including the danger that such a scheme would detract from the ordinary process of credit and act as a further subsidy in the banking system.  The Deputy will be aware that under the NAMA legislation I am issuing guidelines to all banks participating in NAMA who lend to SMEs, to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the banks.  I hope that banks not participating in NAMA or covered by the Government guarantee will also decide to participate.  My aim is to have a simple, effective appeals process, run by people with experience and credibility.  The banks must comply with the recommendations of the appeal process, or explain satisfactorily why they cannot do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_5856">In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs.  This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit.  I intend to publish the analysis from the review process so that the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.  Mr John Trethowan, an experienced banker with a demonstrated commitment to public and social service, is overseeing the establishment of this credit review system with initial administrative support from Enterprise Ireland.  Work has commenced on the logistical aspects of the review system and it is envisaged that this will be completed in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_5857">As the Deputy will be aware, there are many supports provided by the State to various parts of the business community.  The Government continues at all times to seek to provide appropriate assistance and support to the generation of employment in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_5914">I have responsibility for implementation of the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced this month.  Children will qualify for a free pre-school year place when they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September each year.  The application of this age range is being interpreted as generously as possible to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This means that in January this year children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  Children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will be eligible for the free preschool year in September 2010.  I understand that the child referred to by the Deputy will qualify for the free preschool year in September 2010, however, if his parents choose to send him to primary school at that time he will not be able to avail of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5915">The majority of children participating in the scheme would be expected to commence primary school between the age of 4 years and 3 months and 5 years and 6 months.  The age range for eligibility under the scheme is designed to allow parents the opportunity to take up the free school place at a time that is more suitable to them.  It is also necessary to the objectives of the scheme that the free preschool provision is delivered within a structure which supports the best delivery of preschool education.  This requires a reasonably consistent age range of children attending and it is considered that the age range is appropriate.</p>

I understand that the service referred to by the Deputy received approval for an NCIP capital grant amounting to €583,157 of which €291,579 has been paid to date and that this is in addition to capital grant funding amounting to €17,972 which it received under the previous investment programme, the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 — 2006 (EOCP).  I also understand that the service has been approved for entry in 2010 into both the CCSS, which provides funding to community not for profit childcare services to enable them to provide childcare services at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families, and the ECCE scheme, which provides funding to pre-school services for the provision of free pre-school year places to children within the qualifying age range.</p>
            <p eId="para_5920">The service should have already received its initial 2010 ECCE payment, amounting to €11,223, from my Office and I understand that Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the NCIP, is currently processing the service's initial 2010 CCSS payment.  Following receipt of the service's January 2010 return under the CCSS and ECCE, the final amounts payable to the service in 2010 will be determined and further payments will be made as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_6033">The development of a new National Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be considered within the context of a national policy for the delivery of rehabilitation services.  My Department and the Heath Service Executive established a Working Group to develop a policy/strategy for the provision of rehabilitation services.  Its terms of reference include the development of an appropriate policy framework for rehabilitation and a preferred model of care for the provision of rehabilitation services.  The Working Group has met on a number of occasions to date and it is expected to complete its work early in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6034">In the current economic situation, there is a need to ensure that all developments are planned and implemented to give best value for money and with the most appropriate mix of national, regional and local services.  The proposal to develop a new National Rehabilitation Hospital at a capital cost in excess of €100m and a very substantial additional revenue requirement annually, must also be considered in the context of the current economic climate, available funding and competing priorities for limited funding.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital has submitted a business case for the development of a new rehabilitation hospital to the Health Service Executive. This submission and developments at the hospital will be considered in the context of capital and revenue funding available for the health services in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_6151">Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe involving other organs.  Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop the disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_6152">Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland. This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local Director of Public Health, so this makes estimates of incidence difficult.  However, the schedule of infectious diseases is reviewed on a periodic basis and inclusion of Lyme disease will be considered in the future.  A number of cases are diagnosed each year, but the true figure is unknown. However, research has determined that there are about 30 human cases per year in Ireland. In 2007, 71 specimens were confirmed positive for Lyme borreliosis, suggesting a crude incidence rate of 1.67 per 100,000 that year.  A recent study in the west of Ireland at Galway University Hospital suggests that the disease incidence may be higher in the Galway area.</p>
            <p eId="para_6153">A fact sheet on Lyme disease, developed by the Vectorborne Subcommittee of the Scientific Subcommittee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), is available on their website (www.hpsc.ie) to provide members of the general public and media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme disease.  In the future, this committee intends to publish Clinical Guidance on the management of Lyme disease and raising awareness of this condition among clinicians.</p>

The National Service Plan (NSP) must indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the Health Service Executive for the financial resources provided in its Vote. As announced in the Budget there are a range of measures which the HSE must implement in the context of its Service Plan this year, in accordance with the government policies controlling public expenditure, including public sector pay. The savings referred to by the Deputy are part of those measures.</p>

The HSE submitted its 2010 NSP to me on 15th January.<b>  </b>Under the Health Act 2004 I have 21 days in which to approve the Plan.  In accordance with the Act, once the NSP is approved it will be laid before both houses of the Oireachtas and I will be in a position to inform the Deputy of the details then.</p>

            <p eId="para_6503">As the Deputy is aware, the vast bulk of the funding voted for my Department relates to directly funded agencies, and as such the majority of the non-pay savings will fall to be met by these agencies. My Department is currently finalising the allocations for these agencies, which will encompass their share of the €3.5m. I expect be in a position to approve these allocations shortly, after which, the information requested by the Deputy will be made available.</p>

            <p eId="para_6505">The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is implemented by my Office under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  In Budget 2010, the Minister for Finance announced that the CCSS would be succeeded by a follow on scheme with effect from September 2010.  The new Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) scheme will continue to provide support funding to community based childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_6506">The weekly subvention rates payable in respect of parents in receipt of social welfare payments will be maintained at the rate of €100 for full-time daycare.  Parents in receipt of Job Seeker's Benefit and Assistance will continue to qualify and be subvented at the full rate but will be restricted to part-time provision (i.e. not more than 5 hours per day).  The weekly subvention rates payable to low income parents in employment will be increased from €70 to €100 for full-time daycare, in the case of parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement, and from €45 to €50 for full-time daycare, in the case of parents marginally above this threshold (e.g. parents holding medical or GP visit cards).  My Office will also be consulting in the coming months with the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to replacing the current childcare supports for participants in VEC and FÁS courses, currently limited to not more than €133.50 per week for full-time daycare, with a CCS strand which provides free childcare places at a weekly capitation fee of up to €170.</p>
            <p eId="para_6507">The transitional arrangements which applied to some services participating in the CCSS will end with the cessation of that scheme on 31 August 2010.  The changes as outlined are expected to be generally cost neutral.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, I also have responsibility for the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which came into at the beginning of this year.  The ECCE is a universal scheme open to all children within a certain age range each year.  In return for the provision of a pre-school year place, participating services will be paid an annual capitation fee, the standard rate for which is €2,450.  It is expected that some 4,000 children currently subvented under the CCSS will instead avail of the free pre-school year and, as a result, it is estimated that the annual cost of the CCSS, and subsequently the CCS, will reduce by approximately €7.5 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_6511">In 2008, funding of €110 million was allocated for the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <i>A Fair Deal</i>.  A dedicated subhead for long-term residential care was also established (subhead B16 in Vote 40).  Including the additional allocation of €110 million, the total funding in subhead B16 at the beginning of 2008 was €920 million.  Due to the delay in introducing the scheme, €25 million of the €110 million was reallocated to support the provision of additional contract beds and nursing home subventions.  The balance of the €110 million was used to meet other costs within the health services in 2008 as part of the Government’s budgetary consolidation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_6512">In 2009, €55 million was allocated for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  The level of funding allocated reflected the fact that the legislation providing for the scheme would be enacted during the course of 2009, enabling only part-year implementation of the scheme.  The legislation was subsequently signed into law on the 1st July 2009 and the scheme commenced on the 27th October 2009.  The funding of €55 million remains in the subhead for long-term residential care in 2010 and is supplemented by the additional €97 million committed in Budget 2010.  This brings the total funding in the subhead to €1.006 billion.  Therefore, the 2010 funding allocation does not represent a reduction in funding but rather an increase.  It is envisaged that this funding will support the successful introduction of the scheme in 2010, taking account of increased demand arising from demographic trends.</p>

            <p eId="para_6516">Budget 2010 provided an additional €10 million to expand the Home Care Package (HCP) Initiative to meet need arising from demographic changes.  Home Care Packages, introduced in 2006, are tailored to the needs of older people whose requirements cannot be met by mainstream Primary, Community and Continuing Care (PCCC) services. They consist of enhanced supports over and above existing mainstream community services, with the objective of maintaining older people to live at home and in their communities. They are primarily targeted towards those at risk of inappropriate admission to long-term residential care or acute hospitals, or those requiring discharge home from acute hospital.  In 2009, the HSE provided €120 million to cater for approximately 11,500 clients over the course of the year.  The additional packages now coming on stream will be directed towards pressure points in the acute hospital and long-term care systems around the country. This approach takes account of one of the recommendations arising from an independent Evaluation into Home Care Packages undertaken last year and published on the Department website on 3 December last. The number of persons benefitting from this new investment will be finalised in the context of agreeing the HSE Service Plan 2010 but, depending on the mix of packages decided, this could facilitate up to 1,000 clients.</p>

            <p eId="para_6532">Over the last number of weeks, I have been having discussions with the two representative bodies of drugs manufacturers — the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI) — with a view to securing significant savings in the State's drug bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_6533">I am pleased to advise the House that agreement has been reached with IPHA on price cuts of 40% for a large number of drugs and medicines with effect from 1 February next.  In addition, the rebate paid by IPHA member companies to the Health Service Executive in respect of drugs supplied under the GMS scheme is to be extended to include all community drugs schemes and increased from 3.53% to 4%. The combination of these measures plus consequent savings in wholesale and retail mark-ups are expected to result in savings of approximately €94m in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6534">I am disappointed to say that APMI member companies have declined to offer any reductions in the price of the generic drugs and medicines that they supply at this time. The current agreement with APMI expires on 1st September 2010 and it is my firm intention to obtain savings from APMI of at least an equivalent level to those secured from IPHA. Such an outcome would yield savings of approximately €27m in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6535">I am committed to bringing forward further measures to reduce the State's drugs bill. To address rising costs in both the GMS and Long Term Illness schemes, and to influence to some degree demand and prescribing patterns, a 50 cent charge per prescription item shall be introduced, subject to a monthly ceiling of €10 per family. The details will be set out in new legislation which is required to give effect to the introduction of prescription charges and the expected implementation date is 1st April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6536">It is also my intention to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution under the GMS and community drugs schemes. A working group, comprising of officials from my Department and the HSE, and chaired by Mr Mark Moran, is progressing this initiative, which will encourage greater use of cheaper generic alternatives and lead to further savings in the State's drugs bill. I expect to see significant progress on this in 2010, including the identification and implementation of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_6540">Private health insurance in Ireland is community rated, meaning that all persons pay the same price for the same product, regardless of their age or health status.  This is to ensure that health insurance remains affordable for all, as older and sicker people incur higher claims costs than younger and healthier people.  In a risk rated market, health insurance would become unaffordable for those with higher claims costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6541">In order to support community rating, a form of risk equalisation/loss adjustment is required to compensate insurers for the higher claims costs of their older customers.  The 2003 Risk Equalisation Scheme was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2008.  In order to ensure that health insurance would remain affordable for older people, the Government introduced interim three year measures from 1 January 2009 to compensate insurers for the higher claims costs of their older customers.  A more permanent, robust risk equalisation scheme to replace the interim scheme is now in preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6542">The interim scheme includes an age-related tax credit credited to private health insurers in respect of each person over the age of 50 they insure.  The age-related tax credit, which is in addition to the standard tax relief of 20%, is applicable in respect of all health insurance policies and is funded by a stamp duty levied on private health insurers in respect of every person they insure.  As required under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) submitted a report to me in relation to the age-related tax credits and stamp duty it considered should apply for 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_6565">Alcohol is causally related to more than 60 different medical conditions and is implicated in numerous premature deaths, accidents and injuries each year.  Therefore, the cost of alcohol-related harm to the health system is significant and ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6566">Figures for 2008 from the Revenue Commissioners for alcohol sales and from the Central Statistics Office for population estimates, indicate that alcohol consumption decreased by 7.63% from the previous year.  However, the alcohol sales figures do not include the unrecorded alcohol sales stemming from cross-border purchase of alcohol in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_6567">My Department will continue to seek to reduce the overall level of alcohol consumption in the population in order to reduce the burden of alcohol-related harm on the health services and on society in general. In order to tackle the problems associated with alcohol use and misuse we need to take responsibility both collectively and individually.  There is a social acceptance of alcohol in our society and we need to question the signal that this is sending particularly to our young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_6568">The work of the Steering Group established to develop the alcohol part of the National Substance Misuse Strategy is very relevant in this regard. It will base its recommendations on effective evidence based measures to deal with this significant public health issue in relation to regulation of supply, pricing, prevention, treatment, awareness and education.</p>

This workload comprises urgent and non-urgent tests and a significant proportion of activity originates in primary care.

The review highlighted limitations in the current organisation of laboratories, affecting quality, turn around time and cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_6581">In light of the review, the HSE announced plans in 2009 to modernise laboratory services and to introduce significant efficiencies in the configuration and operation of  these services.

Groups such as the Faculty of Pathology and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association will have an ongoing input into the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_6598">The drug is, at present, subject to prescription control as it is listed in Schedule 1 of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 as amended.  No exemptions from prescription control are contained in Schedule 1 in respect of this drug and, therefore, it may not be supplied without prescription.</p>
            <p eId="para_6599">The drug is also listed in Schedule 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 as amended.  As a Schedule 3 controlled drug, additional controls apply to the prescription and supply of this drug over and above those applying to other prescription medicines; for example, prescriptions for this drug must primarily be in the prescriber's handwriting and are only valid for 14 days from the date of writing of the prescription.</p>

            <p eId="para_6687">The National Cancer Screening Service keeps under constant review the evidence base, involving any research conducted in Ireland or internationally, that would influence the target population for CervicalCheck. International best practice currently recommends that population-based cervical screening programmes should target women aged from 25 or 30 years to 60 or 65 years. The scientific literature would suggest that there is no additional public health benefit in starting screening below the age of 25 years and published research in fact has shown that the disadvantages of screening women under the age of 25 years may be greater than any potential benefit.  CervicalCheck is a programme for women without symptoms. Irrespective of her age, any woman who has symptoms causing concern should seek the advice of a doctor.</p>

            <p eId="para_6693">Approximately 2,200 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed in Ireland each year and around 1,000 people die of the disease. Because of our ageing population, we can expect an increase in the number of cases in the coming years. As with many cancers, early detection is one of the most effective measures to avoid premature death, which is why population-based screening is so important. The Health Technology Assessment carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) confirmed that population-based colorectal cancer screening would be highly cost-effective and have huge health benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_6694">I announced on 15 January that screening will commence in early 2012 following an intensive pre-implementation phase that will start immediately. Screening will initially be provided to those aged 60 to 69 years, covering some 400,000 people in this age group, and will be provided on a national basis irrespective of where people live.  Screening will be extended to all those aged 55 to 74 years of age as logistics and resources allow. The 60-69 year age group contains about 50% of all cases of colorectal cancer in the 55-74 year age band.</p>
            <p eId="para_6695">The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) will meet the revenue cost of the necessary preparatory work over the next two years from within its allocation. The NCSS will finalise the funding required for 2010 shortly and will outline this in its Service Plan, which will be submitted to me by the Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_6707">I am aware of developments in relation to the use of copper handles and plates for commonly touched surfaces in healthcare facilities and their possible role in the prevention and control of certain Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs).  Indeed I met with representatives of an Irish based company early last year to discuss this issue with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_6708">I subsequently asked Professor Hilary Humphreys of the RCSI to carry out a scientific evaluation of such copper products and my Department is now in receipt of his report.  While Prof. Humphreys notes the antimicrobial activity of copper products he states that it is unclear from the scientific literature the extent of the contribution such products would make in prevention and control of HCAIs in addition to those that are already recommended e.g. enhanced environment cleaning, improved professional practice and better facilities for patients.  He also notes that of the  new products or technologies that are currently being developed, many of these would have potential but their use and incorporation into a HCAI preventative strategy is hampered by lack of hard evidence as to their efficacy in actually reducing HCAI numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6709">Clinical trials undertaken in Birmingham on the role of copper in reducing hospital environment contamination, which reported in late 2009, found that "the use of copper-containing material for surfaces in the hospital environment may ...be a valuable adjunct for the prevention of HCAIs and requires further evaluation".  I am advised that a trial that would determine the specific impact of copper products in addition to other control measures in reducing infections and not just reducing the amount of microbes on commonly touched surfaces in healthcare facilities, would be required in definitively deciding the role and value of copper products for this purpose.  In addition there is no cost benefit analysis on such products vis-a-vis what is currently used in healthcare facilities; this is a particular concern in the current financial climate.  The potential of this new technology as an adjunct to the infection prevention and control measures already in use in hospital settings is noted and I will keep developments in this area under review.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_6714">I propose to take Questions Nos. 401 and 425 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6715">The Health Service Executive, with my full support, has decided to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_6716">The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.</p>
            <p eId="para_6717">The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices (LHOs) in Dublin to the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_6718">The HSE has advised that the transfer of the case load from the two LHOs included a backlog of some 6,500 cases.  These are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS.  As a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is providing additional resources to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_6719">In 2009, the PCRS processed over 72,000 medical card applications.  This included nearly 42,000 reviews.  In relation to these reviews, 85% of cases where the required information was supplied were completed within 20 days and 95% within 30 days.  The HSE has no control over delays where relevant information is not provided but it has confirmed that when the required information is received, the review is processed without further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_6720">The HSE intends to transfer the processing of all new medical / GP visit card applications and new reviews / renewals from the other LHOs to the PCRS in April this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6721">Any applications / reviews received before the date of transfer will be dealt with by the relevant LHO.  The HSE is currently putting arrangements in place to track the time taken by each local health office to process applications.  I have asked for a report on this issue to be submitted to me by the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_6722">The HSE has recently launched a facility —<i>www.medicalcard.ie</i> — where a person who has applied through the PCRS can view the status of their medical/GP visit card application or review online, using a unique reference number that is provided on the acknowledgement sent to them.  If a mobile telephone number is supplied with the application/review, an acknowledgement of receipt and the application status/progress of the case will automatically be delivered to the applicant by text message as their case proceeds through the assessment process.  The PCRS is also finalising the development of a facility which will allow people to apply on-line if they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_6723">The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals will ensure: Improved turnaround times for processing of applications: under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately; consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision; clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information; and a reduction in the overall number of staff required to process medical/GP visit card applications, thus freeing up staff for other service needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6724">My Department has been in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for enquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.  A letter has issued to all Oireachtas members today in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_6726">Standard tax relief on private health insurance is available to all health insurance policy holders at a rate of 20%.  This tax relief is granted at source by the health insurer, meaning that there is no need for any policy holder to claim the relief — they need only supply their PPS number to their health insurer.</p>
            <p eId="para_6727">In addition to the standard tax relief of 20% and in order to ensure that health insurance costs for older people remains affordable, the Government introduced additional age-related tax relief on private health insurance under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The tax relief applies in respect of insured persons over the age of 50.  There is no requirement for any insured person to apply for the additional tax relief, as again it is applied at source by the private health insurer.  The health insurance market is community rated so that all persons pay the same net price for the same product, irrespective of age or health status.</p>
            <p eId="para_6728">The levels of tax relief for 2010 have been set as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_6746">I have responsibility for the implementation of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which has just commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_6747">Children will qualify for the free pre-school year when they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September each year.  The application of this age range is being interpreted as generously as possible to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This means that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  Children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will be eligible for the free pre-school year in September 2010.  I understand that the child referred to by the Deputy will qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2010, however, if his parents choose to send him to primary school at that time he will not be able to avail of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6748">The majority of children participating in the scheme would be expected to commence primary school between the age of 4 years and 3 months and 5 years and 6 months. The age range for eligibility under the scheme is designed to allow parents the opportunity to take up the free school place at a time that is more suitable to them.  It is also necessary to the objectives of the scheme that the free pre-school provision is delivered within a structure which supports the best delivery of pre-school education.  This requires a reasonably consistent age range of children attending and it is considered that the age range is appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_6750">At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances. Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_6751">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services. In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards. For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</p>

            <p eId="para_6835">In his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009, the Minister for Finance announced that he would make available three schemes to reduce the number of public sector employees in the wider public sector, one of which was the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement.  My Department issued a circular (8/2009) on 15 May 2009 to give effect to this measure in HSE and other public health sector employment. The closing date for receipt of applications for this scheme was 23rd October, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6836">The scheme did not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6837">Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria had access to this scheme provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of this scheme while still protecting services.  Because staff who avail of the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers were required to pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard was essential.  My Department was informed that the health service trade unions issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  The unions have stated their opposition to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions as set out in 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, referred to above. This instruction from the unions, which remains in place, severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  As a result, the HSE suspended all three schemes in June but continued to accept applications, up to the closing date of 23 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6838">The HSE recently requested my Department's approval to lift the suspension as it applied to the ISER, and to allow it to proceed to process to finalisation applications received prior to the closing date. This request is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_6844">I have responsibility for the implementation of the new free PreSchool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme.  Approximately 4,000 pre-school services are participating in the ECCE scheme, with an indicated capacity of some 90,000 preschool year places.</p>
            <p eId="para_6845">The scheme is open to children aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September each year.  This means that the potential number of children who can avail of the scheme is greater than that represented by a one year cohort.  It is estimated that, in January 2010, a one year cohort would total some 63,000 children.  Assuming this as a baseline for participation in the scheme from January 2010, and assuming that there is a significantly high uptake of the scheme from the outset, I would hope to see an enrolment figure of up to 50,000 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_6846">Services participating in the scheme are currently in the process of making a return to my Office giving details of the number of qualifying children enrolled in their services.

            <p eId="para_6849">Gifts under the value of €650 that have been given to me have, by and large, been small items presented by visiting Ambassadors of other countries, such as books, ornaments, small craft or artwork illustrating their national heritage.

Wherever possible and appropriate, I allocate such items for use in the Department of Health and Children, as I consider these gifts to have been given in my capacity as Minister, and not my personal capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_6850">The Department has recorded one gift under the value of €650, which accrued directly to the benefit of the Exchequer.

On this occasion, four nights accommodation at a cost of €600 in total was paid for by International Conference Services Ltd., Vancouver, Canada. Since I was invited and attended in my official capacity, the cost otherwise would have been met by the Exchequer.</p>

Information on income collected in relation to these charges is not collected by my Department.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7282">Section 13 of the Disability Act 2005 places an obligation on the HSE to keep and maintain records for the purposes of: identifying persons to whom assessments or services are being provided; identifying those services and the persons providing the services; specifying the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports which have not been included in service statements; specifying the numbers of applications made under section 9 of the Act and the numbers of assessments completed; specifying the number of persons to whom services identified in assessment reports have not been provided; and planning the provision of assessments and services to persons with disabilities.  A system has been established in the HSE for maintaining the records required under section 13 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_7283">Section 13 of the Act also obliges the HSE to submit a report in writing to the Minister in relation to the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports prepared including an indication of the periods of time ideally required for the provision of the services, the sequence of such provision and an estimate of the cost of such provision.  The HSE is also obliged to publish this report annually.  While the requirement in section 13(2) is to report on the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports, my Department is of the view that it would also be useful to report on needs which have not been met.  The HSE has agreed to my request that this information is included in the annual reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_7284">The first annual report under section 13, covering information on 72 assessments completed in 2007, was submitted to the Minister for Equality, Disability and Mental Health in February 2009.  The report is available on the HSE website at:</p>
            <p eId="para_7285">http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Publications/services/Disability/DisabilityActjundec2007.html</p>
            <p eId="para_7286">A number of issues, particularly in relation to how record keeping arrangements work for young children, have become apparent since the HSE began working on the 2008 Report.  The Act has only been commenced for children under 5 and in the case of these young children, a particular challenge for clinicians assessing such young children is in determining, in advance of providing a service, what quantum of services may be appropriate and necessary for the child in order to fully meet the needs identified in the Assessment Report and then reflecting the shortfall in an identification of unmet need.</p>
            <p eId="para_7287">A particular difficulty for HSE arises because the obligation is to report on aggregate need. In the case of any individual child, every clinician involved in the assessment process and service delivery could be asked to try and work out the ideal service provision for that child.  This process is very time-consuming and not necessarily particularly scientific as individual children can and do react differently to intervention.  If this process was extended to every child, clearly this would be overly bureaucratic and unnecessarily burdensome on the administration of the Act.  My Department is of the view that an intensive process such as this in relation to each individual child would divert the attention of clinicians away from service intervention and in to administrative duties with no beneficial outcomes for children with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7288">My Department and the HSE are currently in discussions in order to identify the most suitable information gathering arrangements to meet the needs of individual children defined in terms of desired outcomes, to meet the administrative obligations imposed by the Act and also to ensure that reliable service planning data may also be collected.</p>

            <p eId="para_7313">The development of mental health services for children and young people is therefore a priority area for development and during 2009, the HSE established additional CAMHS teams and almost doubled its mental health bed capacity for children and adolescents <i>, </i>bringing the total number of in-patient beds to 30.  In addition, two 20 bedded units are currently under construction at Bessboro, Cork and Merlin Park, Galway.  Further inpatient capacity will be provided, as necessary, in the context of the HSE Mental Health Capital Programme.  Budget 2010 provided for a multi-annual programme of capital investment in high priority mental health projects consistent with ‘<i>A Vision for Change’</i> to be funded from future disposals.<i>  </i>In 2010, the HSE may  proceed to dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €43m in the Mental Health Capital Programme.  Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011 Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year’s programme of asset sales.</p>

Approximately 10% of the flights, almost all over-flights, carry other military equipment.</p>

            <p eId="para_7472">As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_7473">The proposal for the construction of the Galway City Outer Bypass was approved in part by An Bord Pleanála (ABP) in November, 2008. Part of the scheme involving a section of non-national road to the west of Galway City linking the N59 Moycullen Road to the R336 Spiddal Road was rejected by the Board on environmental grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_7474">Two judicial review proceedings were taken challenging the ABP decision to approve part of the project.  The grounds cited included claims that ABP had erred in law in giving its approval and had misinterpreted and incorrectly applied provisions of the EU Habitats Directive and the implementing Irish legislation in reaching its decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_7475">The European Commission has expressed serious concerns in relation to what it believes is a failure to comply with the requirement of the Habitats Directive.  Based on the advice of the Attorney General, the State shares those concerns and contends that ABP has misinterpreted the Habitats Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_7476">The correct interpretation of the Habitats Directive is critical not only for the purpose of this project but for all future projects. The Attorney General has therefore advised that it is essential to ensure that the Habitats Directive is being properly interpreted by ABP as otherwise this could create very serious problems, including delays, for future projects.  For that reason the State supports an early referral of one of the cases, which raises this issue of interpretation of European law, to the European Court of Justice as the best option for obtaining legal certainty on the interpretation issue.  Clarity on interpretation will avoid future expensive challenges to other projects on this ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_7477">High Court judgments were delivered on the 9 October 2009, in respect of both proceedings.  The Court declined to quash the Board's approval and ruled against the applicants on all points.</p>
            <p eId="para_7478">Subsequent to the High Court ruling, Counsel for the State and for one of the notice parties sought leave to appeal the judgement to the Supreme Court. Leave to appeal was granted on 6 November 2009 on the basis that the issue involved a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court. A date for the appeal hearing is now awaited.  An early referral of the case to the European Court of Justice will be sought in order to ensure clarity of the law in respect of the application of the Habitats Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_7479">There are no legal proceedings between me and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government nor is there any dispute or difference between us in relation to this matter.  The Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government and I are in full agreement that the proper course of action in this case is to obtain clarity on the application of the Habitats Directive as it applies to this and all other road construction projects and to ensure full compliance with European Union and national law.</p>
            <p eId="para_7480">I am fully committed to the implementation of this project. However, it can only be implemented if it is compliant with national and EU law.  As there is a challenge to the validity of the consent the NRA was advised by my Department in a letter dated the 2 July 2009, that it would be inappropriate to expend further Exchequer monies on this project until the challenge is resolved.</p>

As occasional licenses apply for limited periods, the number of licensed operators can alter dramatically depending on the day for which the data is provided.

The planning process on the Cork County Council section was completed in December 2008.  €200,000 was made available for advance works in the County section in 2009.  Contract documentation is now being completed and the managing authority intend going to tender for the remaining work during Q1 of 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_7820">As stated in the Joint Committee's Report, Ireland has ratified and provides periodic reports under the main International treaties that impact on discrimination including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

            <p eId="para_7870">I can advise the Deputy that following a request for a meeting, officials from my Department met with representatives of Justice for Magdalenes on the 14th of December, 2009. There was an exchange of information and my officials are pursuing some of the issues raised.  My officials have also been in touch with the Department of Education and Science following that meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_7871">It is the Courts who have power to remand a person charged with a criminal offence in custody pending trial and sentencing.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for ensuring that there are places of detention which can be used for remand purposes but the Department itself has no power to send a person to a particular institution.  Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, the then Minister for Justice approved both St. Mary's Magdalen Asylum, Sean McDermott Street, Dublin 1 and Our Lady's Home, Henrietta Street, Dublin 1 (not a Magdalen Asylum)  for use as a remand institution for female persons aged from 16 to 21 years.  Prior to 1960 the only option to the courts was to remand such persons to Mountjoy female prison.  Payments were made by the Department of Justice for those remanded by the Courts to the two institutions in question.  Limited records for one or two years linking payments with the names of individuals remanded to Our Lady's Home, Henrietta Street have been located. The records indicate that periods of remand rarely exceeded seven days and one or two days was the norm.  Further research is being carried out to establish if more comprehensive records were kept.</p>
            <p eId="para_7872">Part of the arrangements with the two institutions was that those remanded were to have same rights and privileges as provided for remand prisoners in the 1947 Prison Rules Part III, and that they would be visited from time to time by a Probation Officer and by the Superintendent of Prisons.</p>

            <p eId="para_7874">I can advise the Deputy that following a request for a meeting, officials from my Department met with representatives of Justice for Magdalenes on the 14th of December, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7875">In response to points raised, my officials have undertaken some research into the matter.  The Deputy will appreciate that the issue predates the foundation of the State and the historical records available are not exhaustive.  For that reason my answer has to be limited to the information currently to hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_7876">There is no statutory power for a court to sentence a person to be detained in a Magdalen laundry or any other such institution as an alternative to imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7877">The Probation of Offenders Act 1907 allows a person found to have committed a criminal offence to be subject to a probation order under which the offender is released on entering a recognizance to be of good behaviour and subject to conditions. The duration of the order cannot exceed 3 years but if it is breached the recognizance can be forfeit and the offender can be brought before the court for sentencing for the original offence.  It has been established that in 1922 and subsequent years courts did on occasion include a condition in a probation order that the female person who had been found to have committed a criminal offence reside in a particular institution for a specified period (not exceeding 3 years).  From the material available, it would appear that the institution used most frequently for this purpose was a home in Henrietta Street.  This was established at the end of the 19th century by the Discharged Female Prisoners Aid Society.  The Sisters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul subsequently carried on the work of this society.  This home did have a laundry attached but it was not a Magdalen laundry.  In the 1940's there was a request for funding for this institution.  The home was inspected by an inspector from the Department of Industry and Commerce and the finances reviewed and in 1945/46 monies for capitation grants for "probationers" in this establishment were provided for in the District Court Vote.  From the files it is clear that payments were limited to the duration of the relevant probation orders. The review at the time indicated that there were 18 "probationers" in Henrietta Street and another 20 to 30 probationers in other institutions mainly in the four Dublin Magdalen laundries.  As far as can be made out at this stage, payments were not made to other institutions (except those designated as remand centres after 1960).</p>
            <p eId="para_7878">The Commission of Inquiry into the Reformatory and Industrial Schools System 1934-1936 states that judges were reluctant to send girls to female prisons and would overcome the difficulty by sending the offender to a Home conducted by a Religious Order provided the girl consented to go there and the Home agreed to accept her.  It is not clear if this refers to imposing a condition in a probation order or to a more informal arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7879">It appears that these orders/arrangements were made by the courts without reference to any Department of State.  The requirements of a probation order, including its duration, would be made known by the court to the offender.  The records of such orders are court records.</p>
            <p eId="para_7880">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not have any legal authority to instruct a religious organisation to provide full access to their records.</p>

            <p eId="para_7895">The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Bill 2009 which is currently before Dáil Éireann, will give effect to the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive and related Implementing Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_7896">Section 25(1) of the Bill defines the meaning of the term ‘designated person' as "..any person, acting in the State in the course of business carried on by the person in the State, who or that is — ..".  A list of bodies and persons is specified to which the provisions apply.  Included in this list is ‘a person who effectively directs a private members' club at which gambling activities are carried on, but only in respect of those gambling activities.'  Therefore, such private members' clubs will be subject to the relevant obligations in the Bill and will be monitored for compliance by officials of the Department on my behalf.  In addition, section 109 of the Bill contains provisions in relation to registration of such clubs with the Minister and provides that it is an offence for such a club which falls within the definition of a designated person in section 25 not to register.  This registration is not to effect a type of authorisation for such clubs and does not alter the status of these clubs in relation to our gaming laws.</p>
            <p eId="para_7897">The position in relation to casinos is that they are already prescribed as a ‘designated person' under the existing legislation dealing with money laundering and are also included in section 25 of the current Bill.  However, under current law, casinos per se, are not permitted.  The Deputy will be aware that I have initiated a wide-ranging review of gambling which deals with a range of issues, including the issue of the regulation of casinos.  If following that review, and subject to the will of the Oireachtas, casinos were to be licensed in the State, casinos would also be made subject to the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) legislation.</p>

All such incidents detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda Síochána are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.  Almost 600,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter.<b>  </b>The costs of Operation Encounter are met from the Garda Vote, and it would require a disproportionate use of Garda resources to compile the information requested.</p>

            <p eId="para_7955">Valid applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy's Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7956">All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.</p>
            <p eId="para_7957">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_7979">The person concerned applied for asylum in The Netherlands in September 2008. However, on examination of his personal documentation, it became known to the Dutch authorities that he had been granted a Visa to visit Ireland earlier that year, valid from 11 August 2008 to 10 November 2008. In light of this finding, a process was commenced to have the person concerned transferred to Ireland under the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations and he was formally transferred on 18 December 2008 and then formally claimed asylum in this State on 19 December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_7980">His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_7981">Subsequently, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 19 August, 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations setting out reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. He was also advised of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_7982">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and also submitted written representations to be considered under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  Following consideration of the information submitted, the application for subsidiary protection was refused.  The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 5 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7983">His case was then considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State.  On 15th October, 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served requiring the person concerned to leave the State by 14th November, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7984">Further representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned requesting that the Deportation Order be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  Following consideration of the information submitted the Deportation Order was affirmed and the person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 5th January, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_7985">Notice of the affirmed order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday, 12th January, 2010 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned failed to present as required and was classified as evading his deportation. Should he come to the notice of the Gardaí, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the GNIB without any further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_7986">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for subsidiary protection, and for temporary leave to remain in the state, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_7987">The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7988">The enforcement of the Deportation order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p>

            <p eId="para_7993">The recommendations in the Special Group Report (McCarthy) have been taken into account in the budget negotiations for 2010 for the Justice Sector. The proposed savings in the Report in respect of the Justice Sector were €136.4 million. In monetary terms a significant proportion of the recommendations (€84 million) related to reductions in payroll costs on items such as allowances payable to members of the Garda Síochána and the Prisons Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_7994">In common with all Departments, there will be reductions in payroll related provisions in 2010 to take account of the reductions in payroll rates and other factors. While final figures in this respect for the Justice Sector will be included in the Revised Estimate Volume (REV) for 2010, based on the reductions in payroll rates alone, it is expected that at a minimum the €84 million saving in payroll McCarthy Report will be achieved in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_7995">In addition to these payroll reductions, the budgets in a number of programme subheads have also been reduced to deliver the level of savings required by Government. A number of theses reductions are also in line with the recommendations of the McCarthy Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_7996">These amount to reductions of €6.92 million across a range of programme subheads which include Gender Mainstreaming, Graffiti Removal Operations, Equality Monitoring Consultative Committees, European Refugee Fund and Refugee Integration. The McCarthy Report recommended a total reduction of some €5 million in respect of these particular items.</p>
            <p eId="para_7997">A number of recommendations were made by the McCarthy Group on structural reform and rationalisation across the Justice and Equality Sector. Decisions in respect of many of these recommendations will be a matter for decision by Government in due course and expenditure reductions that may arise will be included in the budget for the Sector in future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7998">While it was never the intention that the full €134 million reduction recommended in the McCarthy report would be delivered in 2010, significant progress in this regard has been made. This is through a combination of the recommendation in the report and other measures being taken as part of the Governments budgetary policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_8112">Marriages of convenience for the purpose of circumventing normal immigration controls are experienced not just here in Ireland, but by immigration jurisdictions worldwide.  The contracting of marriages in order to gain an immigration advantage represents a significant challenge to immigration authorities.  This has been clearly recognised in international instruments such as the "European Union Directive No. 2004/58 on the Rights of Citizens of the Union and their Family Members to Move and Reside Freely within the European Union", which identifies marriages of convenience as an abuse of the rights contained in that Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_8113">Marriages of convenience are of their very nature difficult to detect.  Final determination as to the validity of marriage based claims in this area can only be made after an in depth examination of the particular circumstances of each individual case.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform has growing experience of marriages being entered into for the sole purpose of enabling the foreign national spouse to enter and/or remain in the State.  The fact that, in many cases where a suspicion arises as to the bona fides of the marriage, the foreign national may in fact be unlawfully in the State or residing in the State on the basis of a temporary or limited permission is a significant factor in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_8114">While it is not possible to provide definitive statistics on the number of bogus marriages/marriages of convenience, information available suggests that there are significant numbers of cases where such an inference can be drawn.  With regard to applications for residence on foot of marriage to a Union citizen approximately 30% of those cases involved persons who were illegally present in the State or on a temporary or limited permissions thereby giving rise to a suspicion that the marriage is one of convenience for the purpose of circumventing immigration controls.  Further indicators of a problem are to be found in highly unusual patterns of marriages and intelligence in relation to inducements being offered in certain European Union Member States for their nationals to marry third country nationals.</p>
            <p eId="para_8115">The Deputy may also wish to note that, with regard to applications for residence on the sole basis of marriage to Irish nationals,  49 applications were refused in 2009 on the basis that the Spouse of Irish National Section in my Department were satisfied that the applicants did not meet the terms of the scheme covering residence on foot of marriage to an Irish Citizen.</p>

            <p eId="para_8214">I refer the Deputy to my written answer to Parliamentary Question No. 327 on 24 November 2009, wherein I outlined the background of the application of the first person that the Deputy enquires about. It was determined on 8 December 2009 that no grounds had been put forward by the applicant which would warrant me to exercise my discretion to consider an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The person concerned was notified of this decision on 15 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_8215">The second person that the Deputy enquires about is the minor son of the first individual who was born in the State on 14 January 2005, and as such is not an Irish citizen. An application for asylum was made on his behalf on 3 November 2005. The Refugee Applications Commissioner recommended that this child should not be declared a refugee. The recommendation was upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. This decision was subsequently the subject of judicial review proceedings, which were ultimately withdrawn on consent. The application for asylum was refused. An application for Subsidiary Protection was considered and refused on 8 December 2009. A Deportation Order was made in respect of this child on 8 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_8216">Judicial review proceedings were instituted on 21 December 2009 challenging the refusal to consider an application for Subsidiary Protection from the first person concerned and the decision to refuse Subsidiary Protection and make a Deportation Order in respect of the second person concerned.  As the matter is sub judice, I cannot comment further.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_8218">The person concerned applied for asylum on 1 September 2005.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom for the purposes of having her asylum application examined there. This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 3 November 2005. This Order was served on the person concerned which placed a legal obligation on her to present herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Monday 21 November 2005, to make arrangements for her formal transfer to the United Kingdom. The person concerned failed to ‘present' on this occasion and was therefore classified as having ‘evaded' her transfer. The person concerned became illegally resident in this State at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_8219">The person concerned continued to evade her transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing her asylum application. At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having her asylum claims investigated. As part of this process, the person concerned was invited to attend for interview at that Office, on a designated date and time, but she failed to attend. Neither did she offer any explanation for her non-attendance. As a result, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status. This recommendation was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 13 June 2007. This communication also notified the person concerned that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2)(c) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), there was no appeal against this recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8220">Arising from the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 April 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should not have a Deportation Order made against her. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</p>
            <p eId="para_8221">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_8222">In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_8239">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is in the Santry Garda District.  Local Garda management is aware of difficulties being experienced by residents in the area as a result of anti-social behaviour and has introduced a District strategy targeting this type of activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_8240">I am also informed that an active Neighbourhood Watch Scheme is in place and that the local community Garda attends its meetings.  Any issues arising are addressed.  In addition, a monthly information clinic is run in conjunction with the local authority for residents in the area, aimed in particular at older residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_8241">The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit, the Garda Mountain Bike Unit and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  Persons and vehicles are regularly stopped and searched in the area, and a number of persons have been arrested in relation to public disorder incidents and other anti-social behaviour in the area. Where offences are detected, offenders are dealt with by way of caution, fixed charge penalty notices or the initiation of criminal proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_8242">Local Garda management closely monitors patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_8245">I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that all prisoners are statutorily entitled to a daily gratuity. The current rate of gratuity payable is €2.35 per day. In accordance with the Prison Rules, 2007, additional gratuity may be paid to prisoners engaged in authorised structured activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_8246">In addition, the Irish Prison Service has operated a Prisoner's Hardship Fund since 2006, from which each institution is allocated a specific budget in December of each year. This scheme replaced the previous arrangement, whereby the Probation Service allocated annual grants to each institution each December. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a fund from which Governors can make modest payments to prisoners and their families in need of assistance. The award criteria to be applied and the amounts to be awarded to individual prisoners are at the discretion of the senior Governor in each institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_8247">The Hardship Fund itself is primarily financed through the profits from prisoner purchases in tuck shops operating across the Irish Prison Service estate. Funding is only sourced from the Prisons Vote in institutions where tuck shop profits are not sufficient.  In December 2009, allocations were made from the Hardship Fund to all institutions. A figure for the total payments made to prisoners under the 2009 scheme is not yet available because returns have yet to be received from individual institutions. The information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_8254">In the interests of clarity, the Deputy might wish to note that there is no such thing as an ‘application for leave to remain' but what has become known as ‘an application for leave to remain' is the submission of written representations to the Minister against the making of a Deportation Order, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  In all such cases, before a decision is made by the Minister, consideration is given to the eleven separate headings set out in Section 3(6) of that Act, the provisions of Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and other relevant legal and constitutional provisions. The ultimate decision of the Minister is to make a Deportation Order or to grant Leave to Remain in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_8255">At 31 December 2009, 12,076 cases were recorded as awaiting a decision of this nature. However, this figure includes the approx. 3,000 cases where applications for Subsidiary Protection in the State have been submitted by the same persons. Where an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State has been submitted in addition to representations against the making of a Deportation Order, the Subsidiary Protection application must first be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_8256">Indications are that many of those whose cases are recorded as awaiting a decision under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) may already have left the State without notifying my Department of their having done so.</p>
            <p eId="para_8257">The Deputy will appreciate that the consideration of cases under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) is a resource intensive process. It is not, however, possible to provide an average waiting time for the processing of such cases primarily because no two cases will be the same in terms of their nature or complexity. However, the Deputy can be assured that strenuous efforts have been made and continue to be made to ensure that such cases are processed to finality as promptly as possible. To this end, additional staff members have been deployed to the area and investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such cases. The accompanying table sets out the other statistical information requested by the Deputy.</p>

In such cases, I may exercise discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of these Regulations to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection in instances where an individual has identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a clear change of position from that which obtained at the time the Deportation Order was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_8297">The average waiting time for the processing of such applications is four to six weeks, however, it can occasionally take longer where there are particularly complex issues associated with an individual application.</p>

            <p eId="para_8311">Visa applications are processed as speedily as possible having regard to the numbers on hand and the resources available to process them.  Although the INIS website advises applicants to allow six to eight weeks for visa applications to be processed, in fact most applications are processed much faster than that. In my Department's dedicated overseas visa offices, most applications are typically processed in 2-3 weeks, often in 2-5 days for very straightforward short stay visas. Applications referred to Dublin are generally being turned around within 10-15 days of receipt in Dublin and, again, very straightforward applications for short stay visas are often processed in 2-5 days. This figure for applications processed in Dublin does not include the time the application has spent in transit to Ireland, often up to 2 weeks or more, depending on the place of origin of the application.  While statistics have yet to be finalised for 2009, approximately 65,500 visas were granted and 10,700 were refused.  At the end of December 2009, 1,886 Irish visa applications and 233 appeals against visa refusals were in transit or awaiting decision worldwide.</p>

            <p eId="para_8634">I wish to inform the Deputy that no applications for permission to remain in the State under the pre-2003 arrangements for the parents of Irish citizen children are currently outstanding in my Department. I should add that renewal of permission to remain in the State for such persons is granted by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and accordingly, there is no requirement for such applicants to contact my Department unless their circumstances have changed since the granting of their most recent permission to remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_8635">With regard to family dependents of persons in the category above, I am advised by my officials that 117 applications were received and granted in 2009. Such applications were, in general, processed within one week of the appropriate supporting documentation being received in my Department and all such applicants were granted permission to remain in the State. The permission granted is on the basis that the applicant is part of a family unit where the parent(s) of that unit have been granted residency in the State, and applicants are required to provide evidence to that effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_8636">A further 199 applications for permission to remain in the State were received from persons whose circumstances necessitated that they contact my Department (primarily due to the break up of their marriages). All of these applications were granted and, in general, were processed within one week of receipt of appropriate documentation.</p>

            <p eId="para_8787">In relation to the contention of the person concerned that she did not receive a letter from my Department in 2007, I wish to advise the Deputy that a letter, the essence of which was to advise the person concerned that, as she had been refused refugee status, her entitlement to remain in the State had expired, was issued to the person concerned, by registered post to her then last notified address, on 17 July 2007.  That letter also notified the person concerned of the Minister's  proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  As applies in all such cases, she was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.</p>
            <p eId="para_8788">Given that written representations were subsequently submitted on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative, the Deputy will see that this letter has been acted on which would seem to confirm that such a letter was indeed issued to the person concerned on 17 July 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_8790">The applicant, together with his wife and daughter, arrived in the State on 13 September 2005 and applied for asylum on 14 September 2005.  Their applications were refused following consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_8791">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned were informed, by letters dated 15 February 2006, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_8792">Their cases were then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on their behalf by their legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 2 May 2006, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of them. Notice of these orders was served by registered post requiring the persons concerned to ‘present' to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_8793">On 8 November 2006 the persons concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The Subsidiary Protection applications were not considered, as the regulations are not applicable in cases where a deportation order was made before coming into operation of the regulations. The persons' legal representative was notified of this decision by letter dated 23 November 2006. Judicial Review proceedings were instituted challenging this decision. These proceedings were settled on 3 March 2008 following the findings of Justice Feeney in the cases of Hila and Djolo, that I have a discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation order was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_8794">By letter dated 5 November 2007, the applicants' legal representative was advised that they could seek the exercise of Ministerial discretion pursuant to Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 by making further representations identifying any new facts or circumstances which demonstrated a change of position from that at the time the Deportation Order was made on 2 May 2006. Representations were received on 27 November 2007.  Following consideration of the information submitted, the applications were refused. The persons concerned and their legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 4 December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_8795">The applicants instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 4 February 2008 challenging the decision that they had established no grounds which would enable me to exercise my discretion under Regulation 4(2) to consider an application for subsidiary protection from them and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</p>
            <p eId="para_8796">The couple's other two children have lodged separate asylum applications. It is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications where a final decision has not yet been made.</p>

            <p eId="para_8826">Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 28 October 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child. Notice of these orders was served by registered post requiring the person concerned and her child to ‘present' to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_8827">The legal representatives of the person concerned subsequently made an application seeking consent, pursuant to Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), to allow their client make a further application for a declaration of refugee status.  The information provided was fully considered and the outcome was that the application for re-admission was refused.  The person's legal representatives were notified of this decision on 6th January, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_8828">The person concerned continues to meet the presentation requirements of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (G.N.I.B.) in accordance with Section 8(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.  She last presented on 14th January, 2010 and is due to present again today 19th January, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_8829">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her and her child is justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_8830">The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_8831">The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_8883">I propose to take Questions Nos. 644 and 645 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8884">Prior to the introduction of a fee on 7 September 2009, Ireland was virtually alone among E.U. member States in not charging for long-term residency status.  The current fee of €500 is not considered excessive and compares favourably with that charged by the U.K. immigration authorities, for example, where a fee of approximately €950 is levied for conveying a similar status.</p>
            <p eId="para_8885">Long term residency is an administrative scheme operated by my Department since 2004.  It enables individuals who have been legally resident in the State on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions to apply for the status of long-term resident thus allowing them to engage in employment without the need for a work permit/work authorisation and negating the need for them to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau on an annual basis. A long-term residency permission is valid for a period of five years and on its expiry, the individual may apply to have same renewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_8886">The procedures involved in processing applications for long-term residency are very similar to those applicable to applications for naturalisation i.e. the individual in question must be legally resident in the State for a specific period, he or she must be financially self-sufficient, be of good character, etc.  The processes used to determine eligibility have been developed and refined since the scheme was introduced and, as is the case with naturalisation, are necessary to maintain the integrity of the process.  Depending on the complexity of any given case, these processes can necessarily take some time to complete and involve a substantial burden on State resources.  It is entirely appropriate that the State should seek to recover some of these costs.  It should be noted that the fee involved does not fully meet the cost of processing the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_8887">The fee of €500 applies to all applicants on the initial grant of a long-term residency status on or after 7 September 2009.  This status shall be valid for a period of five years after which time, the person concerned will be required to re-apply to have their permission renewed for another five-year period.  Only the fee payable for the issue of a Certificate of Registration, currently €150, will be payable for the renewal of long term residency.</p>

In addition, persons who held a Firearm Certificate prior to 19 November 2008 for a firearm which now requires a Restricted Firearm Certificate, must have demonstrated that the firearm is the only type of weapon that is appropriate for the purpose for which it is required.  This requirement is in addition to satisfying the Chief Superintendent that the Applicant has good and sufficient reason to possess, use and carry the firearm; is not disentitled to hold a firearm certificate under the Firearms Acts; and is not a danger to public safety or security or to the peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_8918">Furthermore, all firearm owners must also comply with the security requirements as laid down in S.I. 307 of 2009 Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009.  The minimum security standards required at a dwelling is dependent on the number and calibre(s) of firearms held by an individual.  This requirement applies to owners of all firearms.</p>

        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the number of murders recorded in which a firearm was used in each of the years 2006 to 2009, inclusive, and to date in 2010 in tabular form; the number of convictions that have been secured arising from the murders in each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1011">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_8927">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table contains the number of cases of murder in which a firearm was used, proceedings commenced and convictions secured from 2006 to 2008 and in 2009 up to 7 December, 2009. Figures for the subsequent period referred to by the Deputy will be forwarded to him when they become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_8928">As the Deputy is aware, these statistics, by their nature, carry a significant health warning.  The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</p>
            <p eId="para_8929">All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.</p>
            <p eId="para_8930">While An Garda Síochána have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, there can be considerable difficulties for them in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities.  It has to be accepted that the reality is that associates of a victim of a gangland killing who would have information of value to An Garda Síochána often do not cooperate with Garda investigations.  Indeed, they frequently fail to cooperate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  A number of changes to the law on evidence have been made to address this.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_8931">Our criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent years.  Many of these changes are targeted at fighting gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide ranging reforms to strengthen the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle serious crime.  The bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  I have also secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_8932">A significant further strengthening of the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations took place with the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_8933">Other significant pieces of legislation introduced to target organised crime include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.</p>
            <p eId="para_8934">A further important development, which is currently being progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 which gives effect to the measures contained in the Justice for Victims Initiative.  The Bill provides for reform of the law on victim impact statements and proposes to end the ban on retrying people who have been acquitted in specified circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_8935">Furthermore I have today published the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2010, which provides for the establishment and operation of a DNA database and will also prove invaluable in the fight against serious crime.</p>

These Divisions, agencies and executive offices of the Department are also based in a wide number of locations, across Dublin and in the regions.  The Probation Service, for instance, has offices spread throughout the country.  Moreover, on foot of the most recent decentralisation programme, 8 Departmental offices have been established in  6 new regional locations.  Staffing numbers, on the disaggregated basis sought by the Deputy, are not readily available, nor are they available in this respect on a historical basis.  Finally, I should also add that the structure of the Department is constantly changing and evolving in order to meet new challenges and priorities, making staffing breakdowns incompatible across different periods.</p>

            <p eId="para_8980">The British-Irish Agreement dated 10 April 1998 provides at article 1(vi) that the Governments recognise "the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland".

            <p eId="para_8985">The current number of staff employed in my Department is 1276. This number includes work-sharing staff, but excludes approximately 300 members of locally-engaged staff working in Irish Missions abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_8986">Accurate information about the specific academic backgrounds of each individual staff member of my Department is not readily available. As the Deputy will be aware, recruitment into the Civil Service is carried out centrally by the Public Appointments Service. Diplomatic officers are recruited into my Department at Third Secretary level, and a first or second-class honours degree in any discipline is a basic requirement for entry. The specific disciplines are not always identified in personnel records. The same is true for general service officers holding degrees.</p>

            <p eId="para_8988">As I stated in my reply to priority Questions No. 29 and No. 30 on 15 December last, the Papal Nuncio, H.E. Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza, called to Iveagh House at my request on Tuesday 8 December to discuss the report of the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation and the issue of the cooperation received by the Commission from the Holy See and successive Papal Nuncios as it carried out its investigations. At the meeting, I conveyed to the Papal Nuncio the deep anger and outrage of the Irish public at the appalling abuse of children detailed in the Commission's report. I emphasised to Archbishop Leanza the importance of the Vatican providing a substantive response to inquiries from the Commission. I stressed to the Nuncio the Government's expectation that the Holy See would provide the fullest possible cooperation with any ongoing or further State investigations into clerical child abuse, including in the context of the upcoming inquiry by the Commission into the Diocese of Cloyne.</p>
            <p eId="para_8989">The Nuncio undertook to convey my strong view that the Vatican should cooperate with any request for information from the Dublin and Cloyne Commission or any future commission. He stressed that there had been no intention on the part of the Holy See to withhold cooperation from the Commission and that it had made known to the Commission, through the Government, its expectation that such enquiries would be pursued through the appropriate diplomatic channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_8990">My Department remains available to provide any assistance requested by the Commission in support of its investigations.</p>

            <p eId="para_8992">The Government has substantially increased funding for the Emigrant Support Programme in recent years; from €4.1M in 2004 to over €15M in 2009. Due to the increased budgetary pressure currently being felt across Departments, the budget allocation for the Programme in 2010 has seen a decrease of 14%, to €12.983M. While regrettable, it must be recognised that this allocation still remains significant and in excess of the levels of funding before 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_8993">The majority of funding from the Emigrant Support Programme goes to support organisations which provide welfare information and advisory services to Irish citizens living abroad, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalised, including the elderly. The welfare of the Irish community in Britain has been a key priority of the Emigrant Support Programme, with over £37M allocated to projects in Britain since 2004, and this will remain the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_8994">In regard to the 2010 allocation, no decisions have been made in relation to funding for individual organisations. The 2010 on-line grant application round will take place in March and April and I will continue to prioritise the maintenance of a high level of funding to front line organisations in Britain, as well as in the US and elsewhere. Applications will be reviewed on a case by case basis and every effort will be made to ensure that resources are used in the most effective way to ensure high levels of service delivery for the most vulnerable members of the Irish community abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_8996">Ireland supports, and participates in, the efforts of the international community to bring peace, security and stability to Afghanistan. The international community is devoting considerable effort to economic development, reconstruction, tackling corruption and improving governance in that country. In 2009, Irish Aid allocated over €5 million in relief, recovery and development assistance to Afghanistan, contributing to a total expenditure of around €15 million since 2007. More generally, the EU is currently spending close to €1 billion a year on various civilian, political and developmental activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8997">A contingent of seven members of the Irish Defence Forces is participating in the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force<b> </b> (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan. They are based at ISAF Headquarters in Kabul in non-combatant roles. The participation of this contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces accords with the Defence Acts and is fully consistent with our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p>
            <p eId="para_8998">To date, no members of An Garda Síochána have been seconded to the EU police support mission (EUPOL Afghanistan). In 2009, my Department seconded two civilian experts to EUPOL for three month tours. These experts contributed to the efforts being made to establish sustainable and effective civilian policing arrangements under Afghan ownership and in accordance with international standards. It is hoped that Ireland will continue to contribute in an appropriate manner to EUPOL.</p>
            <p eId="para_8999">A member of the Irish Aid Rapid Response Initiative is currently seconded by my Department to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Afghanistan and is due to finish in March 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_9001">One of the main themes to emerge from the attendees at the Global Irish Economic Forum, which took place at Farmleigh last September, was the importance of Irish culture in promoting a positive image of this country abroad. This was also an important conclusion of the Strategic Review of Ireland US Relations, published by the Taoiseach in March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_9002">The construction of a new state of the art Irish Arts Centre in New York was identified as a priority in the revised Programme for Government. I was pleased to approve €2.3M in funding to the Centre in December of last year. The allocation of such significant funding is a clear demonstration of the Government's strong commitment to the project which enjoys the strong support and continued engagement of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Culture Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_9003">The funding, which was drawn from the 2009 Emigrant Support Programme budget, was in response to the extraordinary gesture of the City of New York who made a site, valued at $12M, available for the project, along with a further $8M in capital funding. In addition to this strong support from the New York City authorities, the new Centre is also backed by the Irish community in New York, including those involved in the arts and in business.</p>
            <p eId="para_9004">The new Centre will project a dynamic image of Ireland and Irish America across the US; it will facilitate extensive Irish-related cultural, business and community programmes; will showcase quality contemporary Irish theatre and art; and will also provide an invaluable resource for the Irish emigrant community in the US.</p>
            <p eId="para_9005">Government support for this project demonstrates that despite the difficult budgetary situation, we are determined to continue investing in our unique resource- the Irish Diaspora and its cultural heritage. A number of government Departments, including my own, continue to actively progress projects and initiatives which will build on the positive momentum created by the forum at Farmleigh and develop the ideas generated therein, increasing and deepening our engagement with Irish communities abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_9007">The Irish Diplomatic Network is made up of 75 overseas missions, in addition to offices in Armagh and Belfast. The network consists of 58 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices overseas. In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis. A detailed table giving staffing and costs of overseas missions is set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_9008">In addition to resident Irish missions, there are also 19 Honorary Consuls General and 68 Honorary Consuls who provide assistance to Irish citizens in 57 countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_9009">The staff numbers for each Mission are broken down between locally employed staff and Irish based civil servants, who are on temporary diplomatic assignment abroad. While most of the 386 Irish based diplomatic staff serving overseas are from my Department, approximately 90 are from other Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9010">The annual costs as set out in the table below for 2007, 2008 and 2009 are the administrative costs of operating the mission. The figure does not include the salaries of the Irish based staff as these are a charge on the overall salaries budget of the Department rather than on a specific mission. In addition to the administrative costs of operating a mission, many Embassies fund programmes in their respective countries, in particular the missions which fund Irish Aid activities. For example, while in 2008 the Embassy in Ethiopia had administrative costs of €1.1 million, it managed an aid programme of €36 million through the Mission in that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9011">The administrative costs of offices in Irish Aid Programme Countries (highlighted in bold) are often high due to issues such as the additional security required in a developing country context. In addition to the normal staffing of Irish Aid offices, which generally consists of a small number of Irish diplomats, working with a maximum of three specialist technical staff from Ireland and a small number of locally-recruited administrative staff (as detailed below), there are often additional staff required to engage in programme activities or staff who are hired to provide specific services such as security (such staff are not included in the following table).</p>
            <p eId="para_9012">Also, from time to time Missions may incur significant capital expenditure in relation to their premises or for upgrading of essential infrastructure. These capital costs are not included in the annual administrative costs as detailed below.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard Allen</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         if he will summon the Iranian ambassador to his offices to discuss the trial of seven imprisoned Baha’is in Iran in view of the fact that there is concern for the safety of these people while they are in prison prior to and after the trial in view of the fact that there are strong suggestions that the outcome of the judicial process has been predetermined. 
        [1163/10]

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_1024">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9476">As the Deputy will be aware from my previous replies on this matter, I am very conscious of the treatment of the Baha'i community in Iran and of the particular case of these seven Baha'i, who have been in detention since 2008. I have personally raised this case, and matters relating to human rights and religious freedom generally, directly with the Iranian authorities at the highest levels. In addition, my Department frequently conveys my concerns on such matters to the Iranian Ambassador here, most recently at a meeting with him last November. Officials of my Department also meet regularly with members of the Baha'i community in Ireland; such a meeting took place only last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_9477">After numerous deferrals, the trial of these seven Baha'i commenced in Teheran on 12 January. The EU High Representative issued a strong declaration on 12 January, which Ireland fully supported, expressing the EU's serious concerns about the trial and the motivation for the charges brought. The declaration also drew attention to Iran's obligations to guarantee freedom of religion under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a signatory.</p>
            <p eId="para_9478">The EU has called for a just, fair and open trial, respecting international standards and requested independent observation of the proceedings. However, I understand that no independent observers were permitted to enter the court and that even the defendants' lawyers, to whom they have had very limited access during their detention, had some difficulty in obtaining entry. At this stage it is not clear what charges were laid against the defendants in court, when the next trial date will take place or what the future judicial process might entail. The situation may be further complicated by the recent detention of another 13 members of the Baha'i community, for alleged involvement in anti-government activity, following the Ashura protests on 27 December. These arrests have also raised serious concerns in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_9479">The issue of the trial of the Baha'i and the broader issue of human rights in Iran are likely to be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council later this month. Ireland will also support consideration of these matters at the forthcoming meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in March.</p>

            <p eId="para_9483">I am aware of a number of Irish investors who are experiencing difficulties with their investments in Turkish property.</p>
            <p eId="para_9484">The common issue in most cases relates to Irish purchasers finding it difficult to claim their title deeds. The issues involved are complex and many cases are now the subject of private legal proceedings. The majority of these cases are primarily civil matters and as such should be resolved through arbitration and, if necessary, the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_9485">The Irish Embassy in Ankara has been working with the Turkish authorities and a Turkish officer in the Ministry of Finance has been designated as a contact point for Irish nationals experiencing difficulties regarding their property investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9486">I recently wrote to my counterpart, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, to raise my concerns regarding these difficulties being experienced by Irish citizens, and to ask for any assistance that he could provide regarding the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_9487">The European Commission is already aware of a number of these cases. However, the Commission is only in a position to raise the issue with the Turkish Government, in the context of the legislative framework on the free movement of capital (particularly on real estate acquisition) and its implementation, when there has been discriminatory treatment of EU citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_9488">I believe, therefore that the bilateral approach is the most appropriate course of action to take in addressing these difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_9564">Working Holiday agreements are concluded between Ireland and other Governments on a reciprocal basis. For Irish citizens the application is administered directly with the Embassy concerned or through an authorised sponsoring organisation. While precise figures are not yet available in relation to the number of visa applications by Irish citizens approved in all of the countries listed, the table beneath sets out the visa allocations for 2010 and available information on the number approved in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_9565">In the case of Australia there is no specific allocation for Irish nationals under the Working Holiday Agreement. Approvals are usually dependant on meeting the eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_9566">The working holiday agreement concluded between Ireland and the United States, which was launched in 2009, allows those enrolled in or recently graduated from post secondary education to apply for a visa to work and live in the United States for a period of one year. There is no numerical limit on the number of visas available.</p>
            <p eId="para_9567">Allocations under the Working Holiday agreements for each of the countries concerned are reviewed on a regular basis. Allocations remain unchanged from 2009 to 2010 with the exception of Canada which increased from 2500 to 4000. Information on visa approvals to the US is not released on an individual country basis so the figure quoted below is an estimate.</p>

            <p eId="para_9596">I propose to take Questions Nos. 673 and 677 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9597">I am aware of the case of Dr Sadok Shourou, who was re-arrested on 3 December 2008, shortly after serving nearly 18 years of a 30 year sentence for his leadership of an Islamist group allegedly attempting to overthrow the Tunisian government. NGOs who observed his original trial at the time were critical of the proceedings. I also understand that Dr. Shourou was arrested for the second time on foot of comments he had made publicly and to the media about his earlier detention. He had also urged legalisation of the an-Nahdha political movement, of which he is the former president. The Tunisian authorities banned the an-Nahdha Party in 1991 on the grounds that they viewed it as an extremist organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_9598">Dr Shourou was sentenced on 13 December 2008 to a further year in prison on charges of resuming his political activities and speaking on behalf of a banned movement. His appeal in March 2009 was denied. Reports indicate that he remains in custody. I understand that there are concerns about his health, given the duration of his earlier period in detention and that he is now 62 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_9599">The issue of freedom of expression and human rights generally in Tunisia is an important one and is subject to regular consideration at EU level. The EU has supported measures by the Tunisian authorities to promote pluralism, democracy and freedom of expression and of association. The EU also has a regular dialogue with Tunisia on human rights within the framework of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement. Regrettably, the latest meeting of the sub-committee on human rights and democracy, which should have taken place under the Swedish Presidency, had to be postponed, at Tunisia's request. I hope that it will be re-arranged during the current Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_9600">Dr Shourou's case has been raised at UN level by a number of NGOs, including in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Tunisia at the UN Human Rights Council in April 2008. It is possible this contributed to Dr. Shourou's release later that year. I understand that "The International Campaign for Human Rights in Tunisia" has set up a Facebook page to promote the cause of Dr Shourou, but I am not otherwise aware of the activities of this group.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_9614">On Tuesday, 12 January, at approximately 16:53h local time, an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale was recorded off the coast of Haiti, only 17km from the capital Port au Prince. Casualties are believed to be in the tens of thousands and widespread destruction of infrastructure has been reported, including to schools and hospitals. Water and electricity supplies are down, and there is very limited communication. I am deeply saddened by these events and I join with the President in expressing the condolences of the Irish people to the nation of Haiti.</p>
            <p eId="para_9615">A UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team arrived in Haiti last week. Other emergency teams from, amongst others, the UN, Red Cross, and Non-governmental Organisation have also been flooding into the country over the past few days. It is apparent that a major relief effort is required and immediate priorities include search and rescue, emergency medical assistance, shelter, clean water, food and sanitation equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9616">Yesterday I attended an emergency meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council at which Ministers agreed an initial response of €122 million to meet Haiti's short term humanitarian needs. Ireland has contributed €2 million, including €1 million to an urgent appeal launched by the UN on 15 January. The remainder will be disbursed via NGOs operating in Haiti and the Red Cross — to whom we have already disbursed €250,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_9617">In addition to our financial support Ireland today dispatched approximately 83 tonnes of essential humanitarian supplies from our emergency stockpiles. These supplies of plastic sheeting, blankets, kitchen sets, soap, and water containers will provide essential necessities for 8,000 families. These Government stocks will be given to Concern and Goal for distribution through their operations in Haiti.</p>
            <p eId="para_9618">We have also deployed two members of our Rapid Response Corps, a 130-strong group of highly-skilled volunteers who are seconded at short notice to humanitarian organisations in need of their skills. The two concerned, and IT expert and an electrical engineer, have been assigned to the World Food Programme. Others, with skills in areas such as logistics, water and sanitation and child protection are on stand-by.</p>
            <p eId="para_9619">Central to the international response is the UN Central Emergency Response Fund set up following the 2004 Tsunami to allow an immediate reaction to a disaster such as that in Haiti. Ireland was very involved in the establishment of the CERF and we committed €20m to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund in 2009, part of a €73m commitment since 2006. So far USD $25 million has been allocated from the CERF to support the Haiti relief effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_9620">Irish Aid has dispatched a small technical mission to assess the immediate needs of the Haitian people, identify short-term gaps in the overall response and assess how Ireland can best contribution to the overall relief effort. The mission is made up of Irish Aid staff and Defence Forces personnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_9622">The United States has been actively engaged in an effort to persuade the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to re-enter negotiations aimed at reaching a final status agreement within a finite timescale. Progress has been slow and difficult, but this effort has injected new life into a peace process which had been stalled. The US efforts are being conducted by Secretary of State Clinton and by the President's Special Envoy Senator George Mitchell, in whose abilities and commitment we in Ireland have great confidence. Senator Mitchell is due to return to the region this week for further discussions on how to encourage a resumption of peace negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9623">Ireland and its EU partners have been working in support of this goal. The resolution of the many problems facing Israel and Palestine can only come through an ending of the occupation and the achievement of a two-state solution. That is the objective of the political process. Bilaterally and through the EU, we have encouraged both sides and the key regional partners to seize the opportunity which now exists, and which may not recur for a long time if it is missed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9624">This complex set of issues is the subject of very frequent discussion among EU Foreign Ministers. At the Foreign Affairs Council in December, the Council adopted substantial Conclusions setting out in some detail the EU's views on the key issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_9626">I shall, of course, be responding to the correspondence to which the Deputy refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9627">The issue of human rights in North Korea and the plight of the ordinary people there are matters of very deep concern. While the North Korean regime continues to invest precious resources in its nuclear and military programmes, and in the welfare of its elites, the country is suffering chronic food insecurity and high malnutrition rates, and remains reliant on external food assistance to meet the needs of its 23 million people.</p>
            <p eId="para_9628">Violations of human rights in North Korea are well-documented. In his report of 22 October last, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea, Prof. Vitit Muntarbhorn, described the human rights situation there as "abysmal". He noted that despite various formal guarantees in the Constitution, the people of the DPRK are subject to persecution, clampdowns, collective punishment, torture, arbitrary executions and public executions and he added that almost 9 million people in the DPRK are suffering from food shortages.</p>
            <p eId="para_9629">I take these human rights violations very seriously. Issues relating to human rights are raised bilaterally with the North Korean authorities by our Ambassador in Seoul, who is accredited to North Korea, during his regular visits to the North. They have also been raised by visiting senior officials from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_9630">North Korea broke off the Human Rights Dialogue which the EU initiated with it some years ago. EU meetings of a more general nature continue to take place, however, human rights concerns are raised in this context. The most recent such meeting, at senior official level, took place during an EU Troika visit to Pyongyang from 26 — 30 October last.</p>
            <p eId="para_9631">On 7 December North Korea was subject to a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) by the Human Rights Council. A wide range of issues regarding human rights abuses were raised. In its contribution to the UPR, the Irish delegation raised a number of specific human rights issues directly with the DPRK authorities, including those relating to the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion. We noted the widely-shared alarm, across the international community and from all regions, at the extent of human suffering caused by the violations of human rights in DPRK and we called again on the authorities there to work with the Special Rapporteur. Unfortunately, North Korea has consistently refused to recognise or co-operate in any way with the Special Rapporteur or with any other human rights investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9632">As regards the issue of money laundering, I am certainly aware that there are widespread allegations relating to North Korea's financial arrangements abroad and to possible money-laundering activities. This issue was much highlighted previously in the context of Macau. Action has been taken internationally to address illegal money-laundering and we will continue to monitor whether additional regulation is required in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_9633">At the EU level, the EU Council's 3rd Money Laundering Directive requires financial institutions and certain other persons, such as lawyers and accountants, to identify their customers (including beneficial owners) and to report suspicions of money laundering to the national authorities . This Directive's provisions apply to all EU Member States, including Luxembourg.</p>

            <p eId="para_9651">As I have previously informed the House, special funding of €2.5 million was allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the appointment of 20 Sports Inclusion Development Officers (SIDOs) in Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) in 2008.  The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.</p>

The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_9653">Of the €2.5 million allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the SIDO scheme, €800,000 was provided through my Department's Vote in 2008 and over €1.3 million in 2009.

            <p eId="para_9656">As stated in my reply to PQ 46932/09 (277) on 15 December 2009, my Department is committed to supporting the balanced implementation of the broad sustainability agenda in tourism development, in line with Programme for Government commitments.  With specific regard to eco-tourism and the use of sustainable technology, such commitments include, <i>inter alia</i>, seeking, with the Tourism Agencies and Local Authorities, suitable areas to develop and promote eco-tourism, as well as enhancing the existing Northwest Project, the Green Box, as well as the promotion of best practice in terms of environmental sustainability.  Delivering on such commitments involves a combination of actions at a strategic, policy level by my Department, as well as operational actions by Fáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_9657">At the sectorial policy level, the current tourism development strategy, <i>New Horizons for Irish Tourism:  An Agenda for Action 2003-2012</i>, recognises the importance of good management practices in maintaining and enhancing the attractiveness of both the built and natural environments.  The recently published Report of the Tourism Renewal Group further recognises the fact that tourism is particularly well-positioned for a green economy/sustainable development approach and acknowledges the importance of Ireland’s environment to the visitor experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_9658">At the operational level, the promotion of good environmental practice within the tourism industry, including the use of sustainable technology, is a matter for Fáilte Ireland.  Similarly, Fáilte Ireland also has responsibility for the development of tourist facilities and services, including specific product segments such as eco-tourism.  I am advised by Fáilte Ireland that, following overseas market research undertaken during summer 2009, it is currently devising a strategy for the development of the natural heritage tourism product, part of which is focused specifically on eco-tourism.  This follows the launch in March 2009 of an "Ecotourism Handbook", published by Fáilte Ireland in association with the Greenbox eco-tourism project, which is a practical guide designed to assist tourism businesses that want to develop as eco-tourism businesses in order to increase their overall sustainability and generate new business.</p>
            <p eId="para_9659">I am further advised by Fáilte Ireland that it has also been involved with groups in both the Burren and South Kerry regarding eco-tourism.  The project with a group in the Burren, to help establish it as a destination for eco-tourism, involves training in environmental standards, certification and the development of a holistic tourism experience in the area that meets the needs of international customers, as highlighted in recent research.</p>
            <p eId="para_9660">Most recently, just before Christmas 2009, as part of the Collabor8 Interreg Project, Fáilte Ireland, in association with the South Kerry Development Partnership, initiated a project which will see the introduction of an eco-label for tourism micro-enterprises in the South Kerry area.  I understand that 60 micro-enterprises have already signed up for the project and training for them will begin at the end of January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_9661">In addition to strategies and programmes under my own Department and Fáilte Ireland, I understand that there are further supports available to help Irish businesses (including those in the tourism sector) make more efficient and sustainable use of resources, thus benefitting the business itself, the local economy and the environment.  Such supports include guidance available from and programmes administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for which my colleagues the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are responsible, respectively.  Furthermore, there is also a scheme of accelerated capital allowances for energy equipment, a tax incentive aimed at encouraging companies across all sectors to invest in energy saving technology (as approved and listed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources), which was extended in Budget 2010 to include catering and hospitality equipment.</p>

            <p eId="para_9675">In his Financial Statement on Budget 2010 last month, my colleague Mr Brian Lenihan TD,<i/>Minister for Finance, stated that Iarnród Éireann have agreed to participate in a new scheme, to be developed by Fáilte Ireland, aimed at senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_9676">As previously indicated, the scheme is to be developed by Fáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority. I am advised by Fáilte Ireland that it has had initial discussions with Iarnród Éireann, that work is currently underway to finalise the details of this scheme and that arrangements are expected to be finalised in time for the start of the peak tourism season.</p>
            <p eId="para_9677">More information on this initiative will be given by Fáilte Ireland and Iarnród Éireann when the details have been finalised.  This imaginative initiative should boost visitor numbers in the older age cohorts, which remains a strong market segment for Irish tourism.</p>

            <p eId="para_9679">All of the proposals identified in the Report of the Special Group have been taken into account in the allocation of savings for my Department's Vote Group in 2010. The following tabular statement outlines the proposals made by the Special Group and the reductions that have been applied to the relevant allocations for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_9680">In addition to those outlined, further savings will be achieved by reductions in allocations to various programmes across my Department which were not included in the Recommendations of the Special Group. In total, reductions in allocations for 2010 will yield savings of €28m in current expenditure and €17m in capital expenditure. The Deputy will be aware that an additional €14m was made available in the Budget for tourism product development in 2010, resulting in net capital expenditure savings of €3m in my Department's Vote Group.</p>

I understand the project referred to by the Deputy has submitted an appeal and that officials from my Department have been in touch with them in this regard.

It is intended that the appeals process would be completed before end-January 2010 and during that period temporary funding has been provided in respect of the basic running costs of projects under appeal, i.e., grant towards salaries and appropriate overheads.</p>

            <p eId="para_9814">As the Deputy will be aware, the recommendations in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes represented a set of options that were given appropriate consideration by Government in the context of the 2010 Budget. The Government decided, as part of its strategy to manage its way through the current severe economic crisis and to return the country to prosperity, to reduce spending on public services by almost €1 billion in 2010 compared with the pre-Budget estimates. To the greatest extent possible, the savings have been sought through efficiencies rather than through reductions in services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9815">In the case of my own Department, gross funding at €415.426m in 2010 is a reduction of 13% relative to the 2009 allocation of €475.701m. Current funding is reduced by 9%, a decrease of €32.1m, and capital funding is reduced by 21%, a decrease of €28.175m.</p>
            <p eId="para_9816">The breakdown of these reductions is provided in the recently published Budget Estimates Volume. However, for the Deputy's convenience, the table shows the breakdown by Programme Area of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_9990">Social insurance contributions are not transferable between here and the UK, and vice versa. However, in accordance with EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72, which coordinate social security entitlements for those who have worked in more than one Member State, contributions made in the UK, and other EU countries, can be aggregated with Irish contributions to help a person qualify for pensions and other benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_9991">When a person makes a claim in Ireland for a contributory state pension and they indicate that they have worked in the UK, or other EU Member States, the countries involved will not be notified that a claim has been made and request details of the insurance contributions made in those other countries will be requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_9992">The contributions made in the other countries may be added to the Irish record to satisfy the basic qualifying conditions and to determine the pension a person would be entitled to if all the contributions had been made in Ireland. A calculation is then performed to arrive at the actual rate of pension to be paid which will reflect the proportion of Irish contributions in a person's overall insurance record. Other countries in which the person has contributed will carry out a similar operation and the person may, depending on the basic qualifying conditions in the different Member States, receive a number of different pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_9993">A person's position would, as part of the process, also be assessed under domestic legislation looking only at their Irish contributions. The Irish pension to be paid from Ireland will be either the rate determined under EU Regulations or domestic legislation, which ever is higher. The same applies to other Member States.</p>

            <p eId="para_9996">Parents or other qualified informants may register a birth using either of the official languages of the State, and this has been the case for many years.  Section 61 of the Act provides that a true copy of an entry in the register of births must be provided to any person, upon payment of a prescribed fee. Accordingly, true copies of entries that were registered in the English language must be issued in English and entries registered <i>as Gaeilge</i> must be provided in Irish.  To issue a certificate containing details other than those registered would be contrary to section 61 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_9997">An entry in the register of births is a historical record of the facts as pertaining at the time of birth and cannot be updated to reflect changed circumstances.  The fact that a person's birth is registered in one or other of the official languages of the State does not impact upon a person's right to be known by either the Irish or English version of their name. A person acquires their name by use and repute under the common law, and there is no requirement in law that a person must be known by the name contained in their birth entry.</p>
            <p eId="para_9998">If a person who uses a name other than that which is entered in the register of births wishes to have an official record of this, it is open to the person concerned to obtain a change of name by Deed Poll.</p>

            <p eId="para_10009">The Civil Registration Service does record information relating to the nationality but not the citizenship of persons marrying in Ireland. Prior to the commencement of the marriage provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 in November, 2007, no information was recorded in relation to nationality. There is therefore no information available in relation to the nationality of persons who married here in the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and almost all of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_10010">It should be borne in mind that the legislation referred to above contains transitional provisions in respect of Roman Catholic marriages. Section 49(8) of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 provided that where a couple notified their intention to marry prior to the 5 th November 2007 in respect of a Roman Catholic marriage and the marriage was solemnised on or after that date, the certificate (Form A) provided for under section 11 of the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863 was used to effect registration. As the form in question did not provide for recording the nationality of the parties to these marriages, data relating to the nationality of the parties to such marriages is not available. The number of marriages registered on foot of these certificates in 2008 and 2009 is shown at 1 in the table.  Statistics concerning the marriages of EU nationals and non-EU Nationals in Ireland in 2008 and 2009 is shown at 3 in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_10034">Changes to the Treatment Benefit scheme were announced in Budget 2010.  From 1st January 2010, treatments available under the scheme are limited to a free Optical and Dental examination together with the treatments previously available under the medical appliance scheme, namely hearing aids and contact lenses required for medical reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_10035">People who, at 31st December 2009, were undergoing a course of treatment or who had applied for approval to commence treatment, will have their applications for dental benefit processed under the rules which operated prior to January 1st 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_10036">In the period immediately after the changes were announced in the budget, there was a sharp increase in the number of enquiries from customers and from dentists on behalf of customers seeking approval for dental treatment.  It was clear from the level of correspondence received, that some dentists were submitting bulk applications on behalf of their patients.  Claims involving many hundred customers were received from 8 dental practices.  These applications were supplied in alphabetical order, as if downloaded from a database.</p>
            <p eId="para_10037">On checking with a number of customers, it became evident that many of them had not approached the dentist to seek treatment nor had they authorised the dental practice to submit an application on their behalf. The dentists concerned were contacted and agreed to withdraw the enquiries and re-submit them in the proper manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_10038">In order to avoid any repetition of the problem, a letter issued to all dentists clarifying the procedures to be followed in submitting eligibility/approval enquiries. These procedures include the need to ensure that the patient had given approval for the enquiry to be made and the need to provide a confirmed appointment date and contact number for each customer.</p>
            <p eId="para_10039">It has been noted that since the letter issued, the vast majority of enquiries have been submitted in the correct manner.  Enquiry applications received without all the relevant information are being returned.  A number of dentists have been in contact since the issue of the letter, to advise that they may have submitted enquiries in error and to ask for these to be withdrawn and advising that they will submit a revised list of enquiries in the correct manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_10040">In the period between the budget and December 31st it is estimated that in excess of 150,000 eligibility enquiries for dental treatment have been received, these are currently being processed.  Priority is being given to confirming patient eligibility, however officials will spot check enquiries to ensure they have been submitted with patient consent.  Any breaches of these guidelines will be reported to the data protection commissioner for appropriate follow up action.</p>

         her views on the model for pension provision advocated by an organisation (details supplied) and the extent to which this model will be incorporated within the national pensions framework. 
        [2063/10]

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_10042">As the Deputy is aware, the Green Paper on Pensions outlined the challenges facing the Irish pensions system in the years ahead, including the sustainability of the system over the longer term in light of demographic change and the adequacy of contribution levels and benefits. The consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper reflected the wide range of views and interests held by individuals and organisations throughout the country. While there was no consensus on ways to respond to the challenges facing our pension system, it was clear that there were significant issues and problems that people wanted addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_10043">Since the Green Paper was published in October 2007, the economic environment has changed considerably and the Government need to ensure that any decisions we make in the pensions area will be robust enough to withstand the challenges which will arise in the future. We must make decisions now to ensure the adequacy of retirement incomes for this and future generations while, at the same time, developing a system which is affordable and sustainable for the State and for those who sponsor and provide pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_10044">In the past 18 months or so the Government has taken a number of steps to respond to the immediate difficulties facing pension scheme members, particularly members of defined benefit schemes. These include the establishment of a pensions insolvency payment scheme and a reordering of wind-up priorities so that, in any defined benefit wind-up situation, employees and former employees who have not yet retired may still receive a larger proportion of their benefits. Legislation to support these measures was passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009. The Government has also introduced provisions to allow for more flexible restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation regarding remittance of pension contributions. We have also protected people in receipt of the State Pension by retaining the rates of pension and other social welfare payments for older people in the recent Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_10045">The organization to which the Deputy refers describes its proposed pension model as "universal, equitable, affordable and secure". As the national pensions framework is still being developed I cannot say what it will include. However, I can say that our objective is a pension system which will deliver an adequate retirement income for all which is, at the same time, affordable and sustainable for the State, and those who sponsor and provide occupational pensions systems. We are determined that the actions we take will be aimed at ensuring that we reform pensions on a basis that is fair, transparent and sustainable.</p>

            <p eId="para_10058">This case was recently reviewed following the payment of self-employment insurance contributions by the person concerned.

            <p eId="para_10059">In addition, Section 110(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act of 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State Pension Contributory unless: (a) the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age (66), and (b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</p>

            <p eId="para_10062">In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards, the Government set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance. An initial sum of €10million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_10063">The scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses are not covered by the scheme nor are losses which are covered by household insurance. Neither does it cover damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation, though humanitarian assistance may be considered in the case of a tenant's personal belongings.  Applications under the scheme are income tested to ensure that available assistance will be prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_10064">The humanitarian assistance scheme offers emergency payments for clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs, replacement of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods and assistance for structural repairs to homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_10131">The habitual residence condition applies to all claimants for certain social welfare payments, regardless of nationality. Any person who makes a claim for jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, one parent family payment, disability allowance, State pension non-contributory, carer's allowance, widow's non-contributory, guardian's non-contributory payment, blind pension or supplementary welfare allowance must be habitually resident in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_10138">Habitual residence cannot be determined simply by reference to a specific period of residence. The length and continuity of a person's residence must be considered along with the other factors.

            <p eId="para_10139">There is a provision in social welfare legislation that: "<i> it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that a person is not habitually resident in the State at the date of the making of the application concerned unless he has been present in the State or any other part of the Common Travel Area for a continuous period of 2 years ending on that date </i>.”</p>
            <p eId="para_10140">This is a rebuttable presumption and it does not mean that an applicant can be automatically be considered to be "not habitually resident" because he or she has not resided here for 2 years. For instance, a returning Irish emigrant or a person coming to live with a spouse who is permanently resident here could be habitually resident from the date of their arrival.</p>
            <p eId="para_10141">Equally, it does not mean that an applicant is automatically considered to be habitually resident in the State if he or she has been here for 2 years or more. A person could be working or studying here temporarily for longer than 2 years and continue to retain their habitual residence in another country during that period. In all cases, therefore, habitual residence cannot be determined by reference to a period of time alone and the decision must be based on all the relevant factors.</p>

            <p eId="para_10168">The Department administers a variety of schemes which have a weekly and monthly payment cycle.  For the most part the delays experienced related to customers on weekly payment cycles who are payable by cheque.</p>
            <p eId="para_10169">On 6 January 2010 An Post was unable to collect 27,000 social welfare cheques from the Department's Dublin computer centre due to adverse weather conditions. The customers mainly affected were in receipt of illness benefit, supplementary welfare allowance and family income supplement, with small additional numbers for rent supplement, mortgage interest supplement, disability allowance, jobseeker's and one parent family payments.  The cheques were collected early the following morning and all Dublin payments were made on schedule that afternoon but payments outside Dublin were delivered one day late.</p>
            <p eId="para_10170">My Department issued a press release and included details on the Department's website informing customers of the delay and advising them to contact their Community Welfare Officer if they were experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_10171">Throughout the period of bad weather, An Post made every effort to ensure the delivery of social welfare customer cheques. In cases where deliveries of customer cheques were affected by the weather, An Post put in place a cheque collection facility which enabled customers to collect their cheques from their local mail delivery office. There is no data available on the numbers of customers who used this facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_10172">It should be noted that the non-collection of cheques on 6th January represented less that nine per cent of supplementary welfare monthly cheque transactions and six per cent of illness benefit transactions. Over ninety per cent of transactions, paid electronically through their bank or financial institution or with their Social Services Card in An Post, were unaffected.</p>

The person concerned was refused Disability Allowance on 21 July 2008 on the grounds that she was not substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment by reason of a specified disability and had failed to show that her means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of the Allowance.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_1105">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_10184">I propose to take Questions Nos. 754 and 786 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10185">The various social assistance schemes operated by my Department are means tested and include schemes such as jobseeker's allowance and one-parent family payment. For means test purposes, account is taken of the value of any capital or property owned by the person in addition to any cash income the person might have including, inter alia, earnings from employment, income from self-employment, foreign social security pensions and occupational pensions. If a person has a spouse or a partner, the means of that person is also taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_10186">As provided for in social welfare legislation, where a person has means the weekly value of those means is deducted from the maximum weekly rate of payment and a reduced rate is payable. Where a person has weekly means in excess of the maximum personal rate of Jobseeker's Allowance, no payment is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_10187">The purpose of the means test is to reflect that fact that the person has other income or assets available to support him or her. Accordingly, the total weekly income available to that person or couple comprises both the value of the means of the person in addition to any jobseeker's allowance they may be entitled to.</p>
            <p eId="para_10188">In addition, where a person has income from certain sources, some of that income is disregarded under the jobseeker's allowance means test. Where a claimant or a spouse/partner has income from employment, the first €20 per day is disregarded, subject to a maximum of €60 per week and 60% of the balance is assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_10189">Where a person has no means, jobseeker's allowance is payable at the maximum rate of payment.  In the case of a single person, the maximum weekly rate was €204.30 in 2009 and is €196 in 2010, a reduction of €8.30 per week or 4.1%. In the case of a couple with no means, the reduction is €13.80 per week, also 4.1%, from €339.80 to €326.10 (including the qualified adult allowance).</p>
            <p eId="para_10190">The effect of the Budget changes in rates of payment where a person has means can be illustrated by way of the following example.  In the case of a couple where the claimant is unemployed and the spouse or partner is working three days per week with net earnings of  €460 per week, jobseeker's allowance of €99.90 per week would have been payable in 2009. This reduced rate is equivalent to the combined maximum weekly personal and qualified adult rates of €339.90 less weekly means of €240. Accordingly, the total income of the couple in this example would have been €559.90 per week in 2009 comprising net earnings of €460 and jobseeker's allowance of €99.90.</p>
            <p eId="para_10191">Consequent on the reduction in the maximum weekly personal and qualified adult rates of jobseeker's allowance announced in Budget 2010, the total weekly income of the couple will reduce to €546.10 per week in 2010, an overall reduction of €13.80 per week or 2.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_10192">As the example shows, the overall reduction in percentage terms in total family income for persons on reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance is somewhat less than applies in the case of a person with no means who receives the maximum rate of payment. This arises because the element of their total income which is represented by their means is not affected by the recent Budget. The introduction of pro-rata reductions for recipients of reduced rate jobseeker's allowance payments would further reduce the overall percentage loss in total family income when compared with that experienced by persons who had no means and are, accordingly, totally dependent on the social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_10193">Similar effects will occur in relation to other social assistance payments. The precise level of reduction in overall family income will vary as the income disregards and assessment rates vary from scheme to scheme. No change was made in Budget 2010 in relation to the means testing arrangements where a claimant or a spouse/partner is engaged in employment in order to maintain incentives to take up, or remain in, employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_10194">Where a claimant, or his or her spouse, is in employment and net earnings from that employment reduce for one reason or another, the claimant should request his or her Social Welfare Local Office or, the appropriate scheme area, to review their means. In the event of a reduction in means, the level of entitlement will increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_10286">Jobseeker's Benefit is a short-term insurance-based payment which is designed to provide income support to insured workers during periods of involuntary unemployment.  As such, it is not subject to a means-test and can be paid for a period of up to twelve months.  In order to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit, a claimant must be unemployed (for at least 3 days in 6), be aged under 66 years, satisfy the social insurance contribution conditions, be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have suffered a substantial loss of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_10287">Jobseeker's Allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment which aims to provide income support to people who do not qualify for the insurance-based jobseeker's payment and who are involuntarily unemployed and, consequently, unable to provide for their own maintenance or for that of their families.  To qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance, a claimant must be unemployed, be over 18 and under 66 years of age, be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, satisfy the means test and meet the habitual residence condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_10288">It should be noted that a claimant of Jobseeker's Benefit may opt to receive Jobseeker's Allowance if it is more beneficial to him or her provided that they can satisfy the means-test and other conditions applying to the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10289">Insofar as the Back-to-Work Allowance scheme is concerned, the position is that since May 2009, in order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the live register and the current employment situation, it was decided to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment and the employee strand of the back to work allowance has been closed to new applicants.  The changes introduced provide for:</p>
            <p eId="para_10290">A reduction in qualifying period required for access to back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) from 2 years to 12 months provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance.  This is in conjunction with a reduction in the period for which the BTWEA is payable from 4 years to 2 years, at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second.</p>
            <p eId="para_10291">Immediate access to a shorter BTWEA, to be called Short Term Enterprise Allowance, for someone who qualifies for Jobseeker's Benefit (with 104 contributions paid in the past 2 years) or who qualifies for statutory redundancy.  It will be paid for the duration of the Jobseeker's Benefit claim entitlement. Allowing people who previously participated in the BTWEA scheme and exhausted their entitlement after completion of the scheme, to participate a second time after a period of at least 5 years has elapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_10292">The person referred to by the Deputy should discuss any issues of concern regarding his jobseeker's payments with the officers at his local social welfare office.</p>

            <p eId="para_10523">In order to identify fraud and error levels in schemes the Department carries out detailed fraud and error surveys on individual schemes.  These surveys provide evidence based indicators for levels of fraud and error within those schemes at that particular time.</p>
            <p eId="para_10524">The recent "Prime Time" programme suggested a potential fraud level of 10% in the total welfare expenditure but did not produce any evidence to support this particular figure. As reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the percentage of expenditure resulting from fraud identified in the detailed fraud and error surveys ranged from 0% for pensioners, to 0.1% for Illness Benefit, 0.8% for the Family Income Supplement, 1.8% for Child Benefit, 2.3% for the Disability Allowance and 6.4% for the One Parent Family Payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_10525">An examination of welfare fraud was undertaken last year by the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  The report which was agreed by the Committee, in October 2009, acknowledged that there is not sufficient data to determine an overall fraud rate.  However the report stated that "An estimated approximate fraud level across all schemes was put at less than one per cent".  This estimate is based on fraud and error surveys undertaken to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_10526">In view of the number of income maintenance schemes administered by the Department, it would not be practical to carry out rolling fraud and error surveys on all major schemes on an on-going basis and therefore an estimate of the level of fraud in each of the areas of payment for each year from 2001 to 2009 is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_10527">Although the level of fraud on most schemes is very low as evidenced by surveys carried out by the Department over the past number of years, within schemes however, some categories of claimants can be a much higher risk than others and when these are identified the Department moves to address this.  In addition fraud detection measures have increased and improved significantly over the last number of years and will be left under ongoing review to ensure that fraud is tackled as effectively and efficiently  as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_10530">Although the SIF has operated a surplus since 1996, this position began to change last year, and expenditure had to be partially funded from the accumulated Exchequer surplus.  It is estimated that the accumulated surplus will be completely exhausted in the first half of 2010, and that Exchequer will be required to subvent the SIF by around €1.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_10531">Having regard to the current economic climate the Government had to take difficult decisions in Budget 2010 to ensure that the public finances are put on a stable basis.

            <p eId="para_10537">In order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_10538">An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received by the Department on 20th October 2009.

            <p eId="para_10547">The transfer of the Domiciliary Care Allowance scheme from the Health Service Executive to this Department arises from a Government decision on 28th February 2006 to reallocate certain functions between Departments and Agencies as part of the health service reform programme.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance scheme is now a statutory scheme with the primary legislation provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_10548">The Health Service Executive provided review dates during the migration of data to this Department in respect of cases in which there is a possibility of an improvement in the child's medical condition.  In other cases no review date was provided, for example, in cases where the medical advice indicated that the child's condition is unlikely to improve.  The Department will review the cases with scheduled review dates in due course as part of the Review and Control policy for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10549">Cases processed by the Department have a review date entered at the date of award, based on the recommendation of the Departments Medical advisor, having considered the child's medical prognosis.</p>

All claimants are obliged to notify the Department of any change in their circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_10556">The provisions governing the registration of births in Ireland and the issuing of certified copies of entries in the register of births (commonly known as birth certificates) are contained in the Civil Registration Act, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_10557">Parents or other qualified informants may register a birth using either of the official languages of the State, and this has been the case for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_10558">Section 61 of the Act provides that a true copy of an entry in the register of births must be provided to any person, upon payment of a prescribed fee. Accordingly, true copies of entries that were registered in the English language must be issued in English and entries registered <i>as Gaeilge</i> must be provided in Irish.  To issue a certificate containing details other than those registered would be contrary to section 61 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_10559">An entry in the register of births is a historical record of the facts as pertaining at the time of birth and cannot be updated to reflect changed circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_10560">The fact that a person's birth is registered in one or other of the official languages of the State does not impact upon a person's right to be known by either the Irish or English version of their name. A person acquires their name by use and repute under the common law, and there is no requirement in law that a person must be known by the name contained in their birth entry.</p>
            <p eId="para_10561">If a person who uses a name other than that which is entered in the register of births wishes to have an official record of this, it is open to the person concerned to obtain a change of name by Deed Poll.</p>
            <p eId="para_10562">With regard to the question of rectifying the situation in legislation, it is important to be aware of the fact that, while a birth certificate is not proof of identity, it is often accepted as such and, in any event, is an important document used to establish identity.  It is difficult, therefore, to see how multiple versions of a birth certificate in respect of the same person could be issued without increasing opportunities for identity fraud and undermining the systems of civil registration, driving licences and passport issue.</p>

         if her attention has been drawn to the inflexibility of current social security arrangements whereby a person who has employment for three hours five days a week, earning less than €150 per week, cannot qualify for jobseeker’s benefit for the hours they are available for work or for family income supplement if he or she has children and the steps she intends to take to address this problem.

            <p eId="para_10566">The Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative employment. It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these benefits that a person must be available for full-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_10567">Under the current Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance system, a working week is considered to be six days. Sunday is not considered to form part of the working week and any work done on a Sunday is not reckoned when entitlement to benefit is being determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_10568">The benefit is only payable in respect of days of unemployment and it is not, therefore, payable in respect of any day during which the person is engaged in insurable employment, irrespective of the extent of the employment (number of hours worked) or the remuneration.. Where a person is employed for up to three days in a week, s/he may claim Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance in respect of the remainder of the week, subject to being available for full-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_10569">It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of atypical workers. In response, the Department conducted a ‘Review of the Application of the Unemployment Benefit and Assistance Schemes Conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis' which examined the application of the Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance schemes conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis, i.e. part-time, casual and systematic short-time workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_10570">The review made a number of recommendations including broadening Jobseeker's Benefit conditions to provide compensation for loss of employment in the case of part-time and other atypical workers. The report is under active consideration within the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_10571">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees with families on low earnings. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might otherwise only be marginally better off than if he or she were in receipt of other social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_10572">Qualification for payment under this scheme requires that a person must be engaged in insurable employment for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_10573">Improvements in recent years to FIS include the change of assessment from a gross income to a net income basis, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and the refocusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.</p>
            <p eId="para_10574">The working hours requirement to qualify for FIS i.e. a minimum of 19 hours per week/38 hours per fortnight already assumes a reduction in hours compared to the standard working week. Any further changes to the minimum hours worked for FIS purposes could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>
            <p eId="para_10575">In addition, the Part-Time Job Incentive scheme is available to those who were previously on a jobseeker's payment for 15 months or more and are now working under 24 hours per week while seeking full time employment. This payment is not affected by the earnings received from the part-time job.</p>

            <p eId="para_10593">The Department assists social welfare recipients with heating costs, through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance scheme and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_10594">The household benefits package is payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households to assist them with their heating, light and cooking costs. This scheme cost approximately €200m in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_10595">In addition, the national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the additional cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full and must be seen in the context of the overall level of income available to the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_10596">In Budget 2009, the duration of the payment was increased by an extra 2 weeks to 32 weeks, while the weekly value of the allowance was increased by €2 to €20 a week, or €23.90 in designated smokeless areas. This compares with just €14 and €17.90 respectively in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_10597">These are in addition to other improvements made in recent years, including a significant increase in the income threshold for the allowance with effect from 2008. A single person aged under 80, with a household income of less than €330.30 a week can now qualify for the fuel allowance. The income limits for couples are €483.80 a week where the qualified adult is aged under 66 and €536.80 a week where both adults are aged over 66.</p>
            <p eId="para_10598">As a result of these improvements, almost 318,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2009 at an estimated cost of €217 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_10599">In addition to the basic welfare payments, household benefits and fuel allowance payments highlighted above, the Department also provides funding to the Community Welfare Service to assist people with special heating needs. CWOs can pay a heating supplement to people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  They can also make exceptional needs payments to people who do not have enough money to meet their heating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_10600">Since the onset of the adverse weather conditions, community welfare officers have provided assistance to people to purchase additional fuel, heaters and clothing. They have also given funding towards the payment of heating bills and for repairs arising from burst pipes.  Over €170,000 has been paid out since 1 January 2010 in respect of such claims. Assistance will continue to be provided towards the payment of heating bills for those in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_10601">Paying a special increase in response to the bad weather would not necessarily represent a good targeting of limited resources. Rather, it is considered desirable to continue to give the CWOs the discretion and the funding to assist people who need extra financial support.</p>

         the progress being made on her strategy to end poverty by 2016 as set out in the Programme for Government. 
        [1944/10]

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_10603">Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) introduced in February 2007 is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. These commitments and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan have wide ranging support, having been drawn up in consultation with the social partners and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_10604">The latest results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), released in November 2009, which applied to 2008, indicated at that stage that the reductions in poverty were on target to achieve both the 2012 and 2016 goals. It showed that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2008 was 4.2 per cent, down from 5.1 per cent in 2007 and 6.5 per cent in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_10605">The position of groups most vulnerable to consistent poverty is as follows. The proportion of children (0-17) experiencing consistent poverty reduced from 7.4 per cent in 2007 to 6.3 per cent in 2008. This significant reduction may be, at least in part, due to the major reduction in the incidence of consistent poverty among lone parents from 20.1 per cent in 2007 to 17.8 per cent in 2008. Other groups with a relatively high level of consistent poverty include the unemployed whose rate reduced from 17.5 per cent to 9.7 per cent and those not at work due to sickness or disability whose rate reduced from 15.8. per cent to 13.2 per cent in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_10606">The major factor determining whether people are vulnerable to consistent poverty, demonstrated by the findings of this and other similar surveys, is employment. The rate of consistent poverty in 2008 for households where no one was at work was 13.2 per cent (although this was down substantially from 16.3 in 2007 and 21.2 per cent in 2006). This rate was more than 4 times the rate for households where one person was at work. Where two people in a household were at work the rate was under 1 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_10607">Our challenge now is to create jobs for those without work. Economic policy is the major basis for creating jobs and reducing unemployment. Employment participation, for example, is currently facilitated and incentivised by a range of education and employment supports made available by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to people in receipt of social welfare payments, particularly the long-term unemployed, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients. These include the Back to Education and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance Schemes. The Activation and Family Support Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme offer supports to social welfare customers and others to help them improve their employability and personal and family situations. People with families who are in lower paid employment are eligible to receive the Family Income Supplement which increases household income while enabling recipients to remain in, or take up, employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_10608">It is more essential than ever in the current economic conditions to ensure that the resources devoted to social inclusion policies are used as effectively and efficiently as possible. The NAPinclusion facilitates this through tackling poverty in a coordinated and ‘joined up' way so as to ensure better results in relation to both the people supported and the substantial resources expended. The range of policies subject to the NAPinclusion includes actions on employment, social welfare, education, health, housing, disability and equality. It is also vital however, that economic policies are pursued at this time that will enable better and more secure living standards for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_10609">Working to restore economic growth must, therefore, be the overriding priority to achieve the overall goal of eliminating consistent poverty and the goals and targets of the NAPinclusion in the years ahead. I am confident that the Government is pursuing the correct combination of economic and social policies that will greatly increase the likelihood of achieving that goal.</p>

            <p eId="para_10613">I have noted the contents of the recently released report <i>How the Poor were Made to Pay: an analysis of the impact of the December 2009 Budget. </i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_10614">I appreciate that the cuts made in the welfare area will not be easy for people but I genuinely believe that if the Government doesn't take steps now to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances, we risk making the economic situation far worse for everyone — including welfare recipients — in the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_10615">The reductions made to welfare rates in the Budget are estimated to generate savings of €762 million in 2010<i>vis-à-vis</i> the Pre-Budget estimate. Even so €21.1 billion will be spent on social welfare in 2010 — €676 million or 3.3% more than the expected final expenditure figure of €20.4 billion for 2009. The changes made in the Budget will reduce overall public expenditure and improve the financial incentive for jobseeker’s to take up work or training.</p>
            <p eId="para_10616">In doing so, we have avoided making any cuts in the State pension. We have also fully protected more than 420,000 children in welfare-dependent and low-income families from cuts in Child Benefit. And, we have ensured that cuts in weekly rates for those aged under 66 are lower than the decreases in prices over the past year or so and that welfare recipients are therefore still better off in real terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_10746">The National Employment Action Plan, operated jointly with FÁS, is the main activation measure for jobseeker's.  It has been in operation since 1998 and has proven successful in that period in assisting people on the live register back into employment.  It provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.</p>
            <p eId="para_10747">Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register, are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  In the period January to end of October, 2009 (the latest period for which data is available) a total of 71,405 persons were referred to FÁS — this is an increase of 42% (21,207) over the same period in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_10748">The Employment Action plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>

An Appeals Officer's decision is final and conclusive but may be revised by the Chief Appeals Officer where it appears that the decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts.  Either party to an appeal may seek such a revision.  The Department requested a review in 1 case in 2007, 9 cases in 2008 and 11 cases in 2009 and 1 case in 2010.

            <p eId="para_10897">I propose to take Questions Nos. 815 to 818, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10898">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_10899">Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>
            <p eId="para_10900">The following is a tabular statement on rent and mortgage interest supplement recipients and expenditure for: 2007; 2008; and 2009.  Currently there is no available data on expenditure for rent and mortgage interest supplement for 2010.  Expenditure data is collected on a month-end basis.  I also attach tables showing the number of rent and mortgage interest supplement claims registered and awarded in: 2007; 2008; 2009; and up to the 15th of January 2010.  Figures are unavailable for the number of claims registered and awarded for the years 2005 and 2006.  Further tables show the number of rent and mortgage interest supplement appeals received and, of those, the number of appeals which were successful for the years 2005 to 2009.</p>

In that regard my priority is to ensure that the Defence Forces have the resources to discharge their allotted tasks at home and abroad.

            <p eId="para_11071">The total strength of the Reserve includes personnel who are categorised as non-effective. As provided for in Defence Forces Regulation R5, personnel are removed from the effective strength of their Units and are placed on the non-effective list primarily for failure to meet minimum training requirements. These personnel remain liable for call out on permanent service or service in ATCP. Since 2004, with the role of the RDF Review Implementation Plan, the military authorities have increased their efforts to ensure that only those members who meet the requirements remain on the effective list.  In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers, all recruitment to the RDF was suspended last March.  Following a subsequent review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budgets for 2009, I was satisfied that there is sufficient provision to allow for paid training for existing members of the Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_11072">Accordingly, on 19 May last I announced that limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing Reserve members resigning, or being discharged in the normal manner could proceed. This is subject to the overall strength figure that existed at 1st January 2009 (i.e. 7,671) not being exceeded.  This limited recruitment continues to be monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the RDF and future budgetary provisions.  In addition, last November I approved the advancement of Privates from 2* to 3* for those members who have achieved the necessary qualifications along with promotions from Private to Corporal for those currently qualified and the promotion of one Commandant to Lt Colonel. These promotions will be made on a phased basis to March 2010.</p>

The primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Permanent Defence Force.   In this regard membership of the RDF is advantageous when applicants are being interviewed in that it affords them the opportunity to augment their own life experiences with those from their time in the RDF in order to display their suitability for enlistment in the PDF. While Reservists are encouraged to apply for positions in the PDF and many do, it is not intended to set targets for recruitment from the Reserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_11130">I can confirm that the I have not received gifts over the value of €650 for the dates outlined by the Deputy.  In relation to gifts under the value of €650, occasionally token gifts are exchanged between dignitaries on Ministerial trips both at home and abroad.  These token gifts are of nominal monitory value as they are offered as gestures of goodwill. Examples of the type of gifts exchanged include military plaques, pieces of ethnic pottery, and ornaments made from wood or glass.</p>

            <p eId="para_11283">The Deputy will be aware that the  Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of my Department's Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of the Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh.  Approximately 200 of  my  Department's Dublin-based civil servants, together with about 55 military personnel will relocate to Newbridge. Approximately 88% of Civil Service staff  who wish to decentralise to Newbridge were in situ at the end of December.  The new building at Newbridge is progressing well and is expected to be ready for occupation in the summer.  Costs in relation to the building project are borne on the Vote of the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_11284">In relation to the Curragh and in light of budgetary constraints at this time the Government has decided to defer proceeding with the new building for DFHQ at the Curragh.  This location, along with a number of other deferred locations will be considered as part of the overall review of the programme in 2011. The decentralisation projects at these locations have not been abandoned.

            <p eId="para_11300">The National Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee is a non standing committee and it was convened for the recent flooding and severe weather events. Its primary purpose is to bring together a whole of Government approach, and to this end it facilitates the exchange of information, ensures co-operation between various Government Departments, statutory agencies, the Defence Forces and voluntary bodies, and ensures that decisions on various matters are made where necessary in responding to a serious emergency event having country wide implications. It is also informed by reports from the various bodies at local level on the progress of local co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements in responding to the emerging events and on any issues which may require direction from the central level. In the event of certain emergencies, my Department has the chairing and co-ordinating role in relation to the emergency response. The Committee concerning the flood event met on 11 occasions in November and December, 2009, until the conclusion of the emergency response co-ordination task.  The Committee concerning the severe weather met on 10 occasions to-date in January 2010, including a preliminary meeting of relevant Departments and agencies on 5 January which met in my Department. All other meetings were held in the National Emergency Coordination Centre in Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin. A further meeting has been arranged for Thursday, 21 January.</p>
            <p eId="para_11301">The agenda for each meeting was in a standard format dealing with the current situation, emerging issues, public information and safety messages.  The organisations participating in the Committee differed during the two events, and also changed over the duration of the emergencies as issues arose and were addressed. Also, the representation of any Department or Agency may vary, depending on the subject matter under discussion. A table follows which lists the Departments and Agencies represented at both Committees. The actions agreed at meetings generally centred on actions to be taken by the local authority sector, National Roads Authority, Health Services Executive, arrangements for seeking the assistance of the Defence Forces and generally to ensure that co-ordination of actions by various bodies and agencies were complementary and inclusive. Examples of such actions were the acquisition of salt for the road network, improved public information, water conservation campaign, road safety, ensuring co-ordination of inter-agency activities, where necessary, and the provision of briefing. It is a sound fundamental principle of emergency management internationally that the response to emergencies builds from the basic organisational units with capability to respond, in Ireland's case that is from the local units of an Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities. Generally due to the operation of a high level of inter-agency co-ordination arrangements at central and local levels as set out in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, formally commenced in September 2006, the requirement for direct action by the Committee was minimised.</p>

            <p eId="para_11374">The Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, rather than the Valuation Act 2001, is the relevant piece of legislation in relation to rates waiver schemes.  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers generally or a class of ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_11375">Any application received for a rate waiver scheme is carefully considered by me.  However, in considering any such application it would have to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction of costs.  In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses who are not part of the scheme, as they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.  This could impose an additional burden in what are already difficult economic circumstances.</p>

It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocations from local authority and Exchequer sources, notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.

            <p eId="para_11395">There are currently no primary legislative provisions governing the designation or management of allotments.  The issue of allotments and any rental costs arising is therefore a matter for any local authority which may operate such an allotment scheme.  I am considering introducing amending provisions in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 to give planning authorities the discretion to include objectives in their development plans which will facilitate the establishment and regulation of allotments in their areas.  However, it is likely that the issue of rental costs would remain a matter for each authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_11397">Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC, which were transposed into Irish law by regulations made by the Minister for Finance, allow for environmental and social criteria and conditions to be integrated into public procurement procedures. Such criteria and conditions may, therefore, be included in the selection of technical specifications and award criteria, and in contract performance clauses.</p>
            <p eId="para_11398">The current emphasis is on ensuring that all timber entering the EU comes from legal sources. To this end, a new EU Regulation will require timber traders operating in the EU for the first time to operate "due diligence" systems as a further barrier to trade in illegal timber. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has responsibility in this area, is negotiating this Regulation on behalf of Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_11426">General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are provided to supplement the income available to local authorities from local sources and from specific grants to enable them to provide an acceptable level of day to day services.   South Dublin County Council's general purpose grant allocation for 2010 is €24,289,702, a reduction of 1.6% on the amount allocated in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_11427">The revenue base of local authorities has been broadened by the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences.  The total raised by South Dublin County Council from this charge in 2009 was some €2m.  This charge is being collected and the income retained by local authorities.  I consider this to be a very significant development as it will reduce the dependency of local authorities on central funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_11428">In Budget 2010 the Government announced a reduction in pay rates across the public service.  This will result in payroll savings accruing to the local government sector in 2010.  Local authorities, including South Dublin County Council, are to retain 65% of the payroll savings to be realised in their authority in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_11429">It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to locally identified needs.

            <p eId="para_11446">Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency has been designated as purchasing agent for the State. In 2009, the Agency spent some €23.9m exclusive of VAT from the Carbon Fund in connection with the purchase of carbon credits. This sum will be refunded from my Department's Vote in 2010.  It is expected that the National Treasury Management will spend some €4.5m in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_11447">In Ireland's case, use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms for the purchase of carbon credits on the international market supplements rather than substitutes for national measures to reduce emissions. The objective of the purchasing programme is to ensure compliance with Ireland's legally-binding obligations in the relatively short commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
            <p eId="para_11448">The renewed Programme for Government emphasised the importance of investment in public transport and in incentivising the behavioural change that will deliver a more sustainable transport future for all of us. This emphasis can be seen very clearly in this year's budget, under which key public transport projects are being continued, to ensure enhancement of rail services, particularly to support commuters, and to give increased priority to buses in Dublin and other cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_11449">The Government also recently published a new transport policy, Smarter Travel: A Sustainable Transport Future <i>.  </i>It sets out a clear path towards significantly reducing emissions in the transport sector by 2020.  <i>Smarter Travel </i>will promote a more sustainable transport system that encourages more active modes of travel, improving local towns and community space, reducing congestion, and delivering significant health benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_11450">I hope that these steps to develop and promote our public transport system will, inter alia, contribute to reducing the use of purchased carbon units for compliance purposes in the post-Kyoto period.</p>

Expenditure by the relevant gateway and hub local authorities to date arising from work associated with their gateway or hub status, or information on financial benefits which may have accrued to each gateway or hub as a result of their NSS designation, is not collected by my Department and would be a matter for each relevant authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_11484">It is clear, however, that the gateways and hubs are generally benefiting substantially from their NSS designation.  For example, investment priorities identified under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and Transport 21 have been aligned with the NSS, and sectoral capital programmes are required under the NDP Monitoring Programme to demonstrate alignment with the regional development objectives and principles outlined in the Strategy.  Furthermore, specific planning initiatives such as the Atlantic Gateways Corridor Frameworks and the Letterkenny — Derry North-West Gateway Initiative are helping to prioritise investment in and between the associated gateway centres.  Collectively, these measures have directed significant infrastructure and enabling investment to the gateways and hubs.</p>

            <p eId="para_11486">In the period 2008-2012, Ireland will meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol through a series of national measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supplemented as necessary by the purchase of carbon units on the international market.  Government policy in this regard is set out in the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_11487">Since 2007, the Government has introduced a number of measures, including the carbon levy, aimed at reducing domestic emissions across the economy.  In addition to ensuring compliance with Kyoto Protocol obligations, these measures constitute important preparations for more stringent emission reduction requirements in the post-2012 period, initially to 2020 but ultimately to 2050.  The planned Climate Change Bill 2010, the Heads of which I intend to publish before the end of the first quarter of 2010, will provide a statutory framework for the core longer-term national priority of addressing climate change in the context of transition to a sustainable, low carbon economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_11488">The 2009 UN Climate Change Conference (the Copenhagen Summit) took place from 7 to 18 December.  An international framework for climate change mitigation in the period beyond 2012 was the primary objective for the Summit, and the EU sought a global, ambitious, comprehensive and legally-binding treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol when its five-year commitment period ends on 31 December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_11489">While the Copenhagen Accord falls short of EU expectations in a number of respects, there are important positive elements, including recognition of the scientific advice on the need to limit the increase in global temperature to within 2ºC of pre-industrial levels.   Other positive elements include a commitment to providing financial support for developing countries, including a fast-start mechanism; the requirement for nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing countries to be measurable, reportable and verifiable; the establishment of a mechanism to support action against deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries.    The final outcome of the Copenhagen Summit will not be known until Parties confirm their commitments for the purposes of Appendix I and II to the Accord.  The EU is currently considering its greenhouse gas emissions reduction pledge for the purposes of Appendix I.  The level of actions to which Parties commit themselves will determine the final outcome of the Copenhagen conference and provide the background for preparations for the 16th Conference of the Parties in Cancun, Mexico in November 2009.</p>

These co-ordination structures can be used whether a major emergency is declared or not. Each authority undertook an appraisal of its preparedness in the period up to 31 December 2008 to ensure that the key preparedness steps of the Framework have been implemented. The appraisals were reviewed by the Department and the level of preparedness among the authorities as set out in the Framework was confirmed. A review of the operation during the recent flooding and severe weather events will be undertaken with a view to assessing the performance of the inter-agency arrangements and to ascertain if any revision of the major emergency plans is necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_11711">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which sets out the detail of the €200 charge on non-principal private residences, is structured with a starting position of a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge.  It goes on to exempt certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.  Where a property is not occupied by the owner, it falls liable for the levy, even if it is the only property that person owns.</p>
            <p eId="para_11712">A person does not have to own a property for it to be his or her sole or main residence.  If a person spends the most part of his or her time in a house provided by his or her employer, then that becomes his or her main residence, and that person would become liable for the charge on the property he or she owns.  Subject to the exemptions outlined in the Act, the charge applies equally to everybody who owns a residential property which is not their sole or main residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_11713">However, in relation to certain other residential properties, it should be noted that the Act exempts from the charge property of which the owner is a trust or body corporate approved as an eligible charity in accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 26A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>

            <p eId="para_11720">As part of a national energy efficiency programme, a new retrofitting initiative was announced in May 2009 to facilitate local authorities in improving the energy efficiency of authority owned apartment complexes and vacant dwellings. Each local authority was provided with an allocation proportional to the number of vacant stock in the area from a national fund of some €20 million, and was requested to provide an energy efficiency plan for the year.  Funding was provided on a co-funded grant per unit basis to a maximum of €15,000 or 75% of the total cost of the works, whichever is the lesser, and included a broad range of works from insulation and air tightness remediation to replacement of windows, doors and boilers.    Under the initiative, my Department approved energy efficiency improvement works to some 1,155 units across the country with a view to achieving an average rating of C1 in remediated dwellings.  Given the requirement to finalise allocations, prepare energy efficiency plans and complete procurement, substantive work under the initiative only commenced in the second half of the year and, accordingly, local authorities envisaged some carryover of activity into 2010.  At end-2009, my Department had recouped almost €11 million to local authorities under the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_11721">The annual provision for the retrofitting initiative has increased significantly this year, with some €40 million available.  Authorities will be informed of their provisional allocations for 2010 in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_11722">In parallel with this retrofitting initiative, my Department is also supporting a number of demonstration projects for the retrofitting of energy efficiency improvements to existing local authority dwellings, with a view to building up the expertise and experience of local authorities in delivering better energy returns in their stock.  To that end, the Department will continue to support projects at Glover Court in Dublin City, Georgian buildings in Limerick City and Sun View flats in Cork City, with funding of €5m available in 2010. The former two projects are at an advanced stage of planning and design, while works have already commenced on the Sun View flats project.</p>

            <p eId="para_11731">The Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management which I published in November 2009 are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system.  These guidelines provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly floodplains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level.</p>
            <p eId="para_11732">It is likely that some lands will have been zoned for development in existing or previous plans without the benefit of a detailed flood risk assessment in accordance with these guidelines and in the absence of detailed flood risk mapping which is now being carried out by the Office of Public Works.  Where a review of a development or local area plan shows that there may be a flood risk on certain zoned lands, such zonings must be reconsidered.</p>
            <p eId="para_11733">The Guidelines define a floodplain as any low-lying area of land next to a river or stream, which is susceptible to partial or complete inundation by water during a flood event.  While strict application of this definition to the land on which the Waterways Estate in Sallins was built may be a matter of interpretation, a development that otherwise complied with proper planning and sustainable development was inundated by water following unprecedented recent rainfall.  I understand that in conjunction with Irish Rail, Waterways Ireland and the Office of the Public Works, Kildare County Council has identified the scope of remedial works necessary to minimise the likelihood of recurrence of flooding in this area; these works have now commenced.</p>

            <p eId="para_11735">Flood risk management is a complex undertaking and desilting of rivers is only one of many measures that may be used to manage risk.  Desilting in one location may have adverse consequences elsewhere in the catchment.</p>

            <p eId="para_11741">Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which provides the legal framework for the introduction of the Incremental Purchase Scheme, has been commenced and came into effect on 1 January 2010.  The Part was commenced in order to allow incremental purchase arrangements to be applied to new housing units being supplied by housing authorities.  Notwithstanding this, regulations are required to give full effect to the detailed terms of the scheme.  These regulations are being drafted by my Department with the intention that the scheme be rolled out to housing authorities by mid-2010.</p>

I will bring forward detailed proposals to Government shortly on the approach to metering of households on public supplies, including proposals on the financing and delivery of the metering programme.  Legislation will also be drafted to provide local authorities with powers to charge for domestic water use.  Following the installation of water meters, which will be phased in over a number of years, households will be charged for water services based on usage.</p>

Additional information about the progress on individual contracts or water conservation works, including mains rehabilitation projects, under this programme may be obtained from the relevant local authority.  The programme is under review to ensure that capital expenditure under it is more focused on priority schemes to meet national environmental and economic objectives.   Last year, local authorities were asked to submit an assessment of their needs for water supply, sewerage and water conservation services to my Department.  The assessments are being examined.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  The assessments form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme, for which a provision of €508 million is available this year.   The schemes and contracts, including mains rehabilitation works, included for funding under the new programme will be announced when the programme is published early this year.</p>

While greater time is required by the Department for the detailed examination of claims relating to final accounts, these represent a small proportion of annual spending.

            <p eId="para_11807">The information requested in relation to my Department's staffing at the end of 2007, 2008 and 2009 is set out in the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_11808">The information is broken down by Division. The preparation of information at section level would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work, as in the period since 2007, there has been significant structural and staff change in the Department as a result of decentralisation, the Moratorium on Promotions and Recruitment, and the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement and Incentivised Career Break Schemes. My Department has restructured its Divisions and Business Units to take account of these changes and to enable it to deliver on its key objectives and priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_11951">Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_11952">The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken, based on the best management and scientific advice available, along with other conservation measures to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.  The Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-Law No. C.S 303, 2009, gives effect to this decision and provides for closure of the fishery until June 2012, when the status of stocks will be fully reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_11953">This review will consider whether the eel fishery could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  The EMP includes a comprehensive programme of monitoring and evaluation of management actions and their implementation.  It also includes a programme of scientific eel stock assessment to establish a stock baseline, estimate current silver eel escapement and monitoring the impact of the management actions on the local stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_11954">I understand that the Eel Management Plan for Northern Ireland has not yet been approved by the EU Commission as satisfying the conservation requirements of the EC Regulation.

            <p eId="para_11956">Broadband services are provided over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre by private sector service providers.  I understand that broadband is available in Turlough, County Mayo, from wireless and satellite service providers and therefore this area will not be addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  Details of the availability of broadband services in Turlough, County Mayo, are available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  I would add that the information contained in this website is provided by service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_11957">It is important to clarify that, in designing the NBS, which was approved by the EU Commission, a balance had to be struck between reaching as many unserved areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_11958">EU state aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_11959">More recently, the EU Commission has announced the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) under which some funding has been set aside for rural broadband initiatives.

            <p eId="para_11960">It is hoped to commence the scheme this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.

            <p eId="para_11967">The 30-day public consultation process, on the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme for the 2010 season, commenced on 14 November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_11968">Following consideration of the scientific and management advice and responses received to the consultation exercise, I made the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations 2009 (SI No. 557 2009) which provide, inter alia, for a total allowable catch of 5004 salmon or sea trout from the River Blackwater (Munster) including Glenshelane and Finisk.</p>
            <p eId="para_11969">A suite of bye-laws, which have national and regional application, was also introduced to provide for the conservation and management of the wild salmon fishery in 2010.  These included the Southern Fisheries Region (River Blackwater (Munster) Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-Law No 866, 2009.  This bye-law provides for a bag limit of one fish in respect of Salmon and Sea Trout (over 40 cm) in the River Blackwater (Munster) during the period 1 February to 11 May, 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_11971">In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  3 is required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and which seek a service.  The company continues to progress its network roll-out and services have gone live in almost half of the designated areas to be covered under the Scheme.  Under the contract 3 are required to cover the entire NBS area by end September this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_11972">The general area of Carrigallen, County Leitrim will be covered by the NBS.  It is not possible to predict at this stage when precisely broadband services under this Scheme will become available in this area.

            <p eId="para_11974">Following the conclusion of a technology neutral competitive tendering process, using the Competitive Dialogue Procurement procedure as set out in the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006, the contract to implement and operate the National Broadband Scheme ("NBS") was entered into with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (trading as "3") in late December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_11975">Operational matters, such as employment of contractors and the provision of frontline customer support, are a matter for Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_11978">I propose to take Questions Nos. 920 and 930 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11979">In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and who seek a service.  My Department, with the assistance of independent technical consultants, Analysys Mason Ltd, will throughout the contract term, actively monitor performance of the infrastructure, service availability, service delivery and customer experience as well as overall compliance with its contractual obligations by 3.</p>
            <p eId="para_11980">Delays in achieving contractual rollout milestones will result in late and/or reduced subsidy payments to 3.  Additionally, the NBS contract imposes a service credit regime on 3 with significant consequences in the event of proven failure to meet the contractually binding service or customer service obligations.  3 continues to progress its network rollout and NBS broadband services are available in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_11981">With particular reference to County Donegal, the following table shows the 52 EDs to be covered under the NBS in the County and identifies the 15 EDs, which can now avail of the NBS broadband services.  Details of all the areas to be covered by the NBS, including the status of the NBS rollout, are available at <i>www.three.ie/nbs</i>.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area will have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_11982">It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would address the issue of unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_11983">It is hoped to commence the scheme this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_12159">The harvest of salmon by any means is permitted only in those rivers that are meeting their conservation limits and which have an identified surplus following appropriate assessment and scientific advice.  Such rivers are specified in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations 2009 (SI No. 557 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_12160">The Standing Scientific Committee, in their draft Report on the Status of Irish Salmon Stocks in 2009 and Precautionary Catch Advice for 2010, advised that stocks of salmon in the River Suir were below conservation limits.  It is calculated that in 2010 the river Suir (including Clodiagh and Lingaun waters) will reach only 96% of its conservation limit.  In order to permit a harvest of fish, the stock has to be shown to exceed the required number of spawners arriving into the river.  The excess over 100% is determined as surplus and determines the total allowable catch.  Accordingly, based on the management advice, no mortality of fish is permissible in the river Suir.  This reflects the status of the stocks of the river this year, which are reviewed annually.  If the stocks improve as a result of the ongoing conservation effort, as had occurred in the River Nore in 2009 for example, it may be possible to permit a harvest of fish in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_12162">There is a range of support measures for renewable energy already in place of which the farming community and rural communities generally can avail.  Support for the generation of electricity on a micro scale include a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour of electricity produced.  This competitive feed-in tariff applies to the first 4,000 micro-generation installations countrywide over the next two years.  Access to the feed-in tariff includes the provision of a smart-meter to facilitate exports to the grid and encourage those customers to examine their electricity use generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_12163">Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is operating a pilot scheme for micro and small-scale generation technologies that is designed to investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with the deployment of micro-generation technologies including installation, network connection and operation, and generation.  Grant aid for up to 50 pilot installations has been provided as part of the programme.  The experience gained in the performance of this programme will inform the roll-out of any subsequent wider micro-scale programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12164">The farming community can also avail of grant support under the Greener Homes and ReHeat Schemes, which are administered by SEI.  SEI's Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Programme assists the deployment of small-scale fossil-fired and biomass CHP systems in the industrial, commercial, service and public sectors.  The Biomass CHP Programme provides grant aid for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion CHP.  Anaerobic Digestion, in particular, offers opportunities for farmers to use animal waste to generate electricity, while also reducing the environmental impact of that waste when spread on the land.  Renewable Energy Feed In Tariffs have also been put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_12169">In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and which seek a service.  3 continues to progress its network rollout and services have gone live in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12170">With particular reference to County Clare, the table below shows the 49 EDs to be covered under the NBS in the County and highlights the 32 EDs that can now avail of the NBS broadband services.  Details of all the areas to be covered by the NBS, including the status of the NBS rollout, are available at www.three.ie/nbs.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area will have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.  My Department is currently considering a request from 3 for a short extension to the roll-out period due to delays in network construction during the recent adverse weather conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_12171">It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would address the issue of unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_12172">It is hoped to commence the scheme this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband and to have the scheme completed by 2012.  State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_12279">The fee charged for a television licence is €160.  This fee can be paid in one payment in full or in monthly, quarterly or half-yearly instalments.  There was one increase in the television licence fee in the period 2007-2009, it being the last adjustment to the licence fee which took effect from January 1, 2008.  This increase was based on a review of RTÉ's performance in 2006, which was carried out in 2007.  This resulted in an increase in the licence fee of €2 from €158 to €160.</p>
            <p eId="para_12280">The revenue raised from television licence fee sales (including Department of Social and Family Affair's payments to my Department for issue of ‘free licences') in 2009 was €226.2 m.  It is estimated that €222.1 m will be generated from television licence fee sales in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_12282">The Government has set the targets for the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity at 40% by 2020.  The 40% electricity target is consistent with the new EU target addressed to Ireland in the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, which requires Ireland to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 16% of all energy consumed (encompassing electricity, transport and heating) by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_12283">Reflecting the need to support the development of biomass, I announced a Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) of 12 cent per kilowatt hour.  Under the auspices of the Renewable Energy Development Group, which is chaired by my Department, the Bioenergy Working Group is currently finalising a Bioenergy Road Map to 2020 which will underpin the contribution of bioenergy, including biomass to Ireland's Renewable Energy target for 2020.  The Working Group is reviewing the current REFIT for the various categories of biomass Combined Heat and Power plants in that context having regard to the particular challenges for the sector.  I expect the Working Group's report to be submitted to me next month.</p>

            <p eId="para_12287">The Home Energy Saving (HES) scheme is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and offers financial support for homeowners wishing to make energy efficiency improvements.  The scheme was allocated €49 million in 2009.  Applications began to be accepted in late March, following the necessary work to establish the Scheme.  By end-December SEI had processed 40,724 applications.  Some €16.26 million was paid out by SEI by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_12288">The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) is also administered by SEI and is the primary mechanism for alleviating the key underlying cause of fuel poverty which is the thermal inefficiency of houses.  Some €20 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, which included a contribution of €5 million from ESB and BGE.  This enabled energy efficiency improvements to be made to over 19,000 vulnerable homes at a cost of €14.518 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_12289">Funding in 2010 of €13 m for the Warmer Homes Scheme and €29.5 m for the Home Energy Saving Scheme was announced on Budget Day together with €50m for the National Energy Retrofit Programme.  The carryover of unspent funds from my Department's 2009 Vote into 2010 is as set out on page E. 64 of the 2010 Estimates for Public Services and Summary Public Capital Programme.  The application of the carryover to my Department's Vote and the 2010 allocations for each of the Energy Efficiency Programmes will be published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2010.</p>

To this end, therefore, it was necessary that each claim be verified by an on-the-spot inspection. I had initially set the closing date for receipt of applications as 11 December, but subsequently extended it by one week. Immediately applications began to be received by my Department, the necessary inspections were begun, following which the applications were further processed for payment.

            <p eId="para_12375">The Regulations governing the National Reserve provide that, for non-mandatory categories (such as new entrants to farming) the Member State must apply objective criteria and ensure that an allocation of entitlements from the Reserve is not greater than the regional average value of entitlements which in Ireland's case is the District Electoral Division (DED) average associated with the applicants herd number.</p>
            <p eId="para_12376">The Single Payment Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department recommended, and I accepted, objective criteria for the 2009 National Reserve including educational qualifications and an off-farm income limit of €30,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_12377">The National Reserve is a scarce resource initially created by reducing the value of the entitlements established for existing farmers and can only be replenished by the relinquishing of any entitlements that remain unused.  My Department must therefore be prudent is determining how the funds in the reserve are administered.</p>

Payments to REPS 4 participants, amounting to just under €100 million, issued in 2009 to those whose applications required no further examination following the administrative checks.  However, queries arose on a significant number of applications in the course of the administrative checks and these are under examination as a matter of priority.  Further payments will continue to be made as applications are cleared. The information requested is set out in the table:</p>

            <p eId="para_12528">The Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  Where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.</p>
            <p eId="para_12529">The person named was written to on 23 July 2009 and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the numbers of livestock maintained on her farm, as Department records currently do not show the person named as having yet achieved the minimum stocking density.  To date, no reply has been received from the person named.  Upon receipt of a satisfactory response, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date if the applicant is eligible.</p>

         asked the

         the reason an application for an allocation from the national reserve, under category D, offshore island farmers, was refused in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo, in view of the fact that several of their neighbouring farmers in the same district electoral division were approved.

            <p eId="para_12949">The person named submitted an application under Category D of the 2007 National Reserve.  This category catered for offshore Island Farmers whose existing Single Payment is less than €6,000 and where individual entitlements are less that the DED average.  The person named did not qualify under this category, as she was not an offshore Island farmer — my Department's Local Office confirmed this.</p>
            <p eId="para_12950">The person named subsequently appealed my Department's decision on the basis that she lived in a Disadvantaged area and sheep farming was her main source of income.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in an appeal are firstly reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  In this case it was established that the person named could have applied for another category available under the 2007 National Reserve, namely Category C.</p>
            <p eId="para_12951">This category catered for certain sheep farmers for whom at least 40% of their Single Payment was derived from direct payments associated with sheep production (Ewe Premium/Rural Word Premium) during the reference period, their existing Single Payment is less than €10,000 and individual payment entitlements are less than the District Electoral Division (DED) average value.  The maximum allocation under this category was €1,000.00.</p>
            <p eId="para_12952">The person named was deemed eligible for this category and received the maximum allocation of €1,000.  A letter outlining this allocation was sent to the person named on 13 August 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_12953">It should be noted however that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the National Reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him/her.</p>
            <p eId="para_12954">The person named submitted a further appeal on 27 August 2008 again with regard to Category D.  My Department fully reviewed the case but there were no grounds for a change to the original decision in relation to Category D.</p>
            <p eId="para_12955">This case was then forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who carried out a full review of the case.  The Committee upheld the Department decision in relation to Category D stating that the person named did not qualify under this category.</p>

            <p eId="para_12961">Mindful of the hardship and distress caused by the recent widespread flooding, on 27 November 2007 I announced the introduction of the Fodder Aid Scheme, targeted directly at those farmers who encountered damage to fodder in the affected areas.  While I was very anxious that the funding reach the affected farmers as quickly as possible, it was essential that farmers demonstrate that their fodder was damaged and to what extent.  To this end, therefore, it was necessary that each claim be verified by an on-the-spot inspection.  I had initially set the closing date for receipt of applications as 11 December, but subsequently extended it by one week.  Immediately applications began to be received by my Department, the necessary inspections were begun, following which the applications were further processed for payment.  I am pleased to say that payments commenced issuing on 18 December and, to date, payments worth €464,468 have issued to 215 applicants.  Payments continue to issue as individual cases are confirmed eligible.</p>

Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department's website.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.  However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to  give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_12983">I propose to take Questions Nos. 986, 987, 989 to 992, inclusive, 1037, 1067 and 1070 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_12984">My Department provides funding for thirty eight projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas, including those projects specifically referred to by Deputies Broughan, Gogarty, McGrath and Upton.  These projects, through a variety of programmes and activities, seek, in the main, to encourage young people not to engage in drug-taking.  My Department originally took on responsibility for funding these projects through a mainstreaming process, whereby projects on interim funding were assigned to a number of Departments and State agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_12985">Thirty five of the projects are administered by the three VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County and in Dún Laoghaire, while the remaining three projects are funded directly by my Department.  The allocations for the 38 projects over the past three years were as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_12986">2007 — €3,621,000;</p>
            <p eId="para_12987">2008 — €3,715,000;</p>
            <p eId="para_12988">2009 — €3,643,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_12989">Arising from Budget 2010, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced to €2,461,000 in 2010 and to cease from 2011.  I acknowledge the difficulties which this decision will entail for the projects, but would emphasise the fact that the prevailing financial position meant that very difficult decisions had to be made, including that relating to these 38 projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_12990">Notwithstanding this decision, my Department has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution in support of the prevention pillar of the National Drugs Strategy through the following initiatives: — the introduction of a social, personal and health education, or SPHE, curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle, second-level;  — the initiatives under delivering equality of opportunity in schools, or DEIS action plan, and the school support programme to prevent early school-leaving and achieve better educational outcomes for students; and  — the guidelines on substance use policies issued to all schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_12991">The SPHE programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drugs and alcohol issues in schools. It is a mandatory part of the curriculum at primary level and junior cycle at second level.  The substance use modules of SPHE are augmented by two support programmes, the Walk Tall programme at primary level and On My Own Two Feet at post-primary.  The implementation of these programmes in schools is supported by full-time support services at primary and second level, which provide professional development for teachers and advice and support to schools.</p>

Supports targeting children most at risk of leaving school early are currently being enhanced through the integration of the relevant services, that is, the school completion programme, home-school community liaison and the visiting teacher service for Travellers, under the National Educational Welfare Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_13008">The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers.  The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools.  If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties.  There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.  A value for money review was published in July 2006.  The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties.  This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.  While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers ‘‘on call'' all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_13009">The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.  It is expected that this measure will save €0.4 million in 2010 and €1.1 million in a full year.</p>

            <p eId="para_13252">The Deputy will be aware that in all cases of purchasing by schools using public monies, public procurement rules must be followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_13253">The purchase of ICT equipment and associated products and services by the  public sector was identified under the National Public Procurement Policy  Framework as one of those areas where economies could be achieved. EU Directive 2004/18/EC provides for the use of Framework Agreements by the public sector.  The public sector utilises such frameworks to facilitate greater flexibility in the acquisition of goods and services, and support more responsive pricing mechanisms that deliver better value for money. In this regard, four distinct National Frameworks for the supply of specific categories of ICT equipment to  public sector bodies have been set up by the Department of Finance.  The categories in question are PCs, Notebooks (laptops), Mono Laser Printers and  Colour Laser Printers. The number of Suppliers on each Framework varies; the  number of suppliers for PCs and Notebooks is five and six respectively, and all  suppliers were selected following an open competitive tendering exercise in compliance with EU and national procurement rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_13254">In the interests of achieving best value for money, schools are required to use the Frameworks for the purchase of ICT equipment under the relevant categories  as mentioned above.  Schools can run a mini competitive tendering process by a  simple email "Request for Quotation" to a single central email address, setting  out their requirements. In addition to the core products of PCs and Notebooks,  schools can also request quotations for associated services such as installation. While delivering competitive prices, the Frameworks are also all covered by a three year on-site next business day warranty and support.  Operation of the Frameworks is governed by Vendor Participation Agreements,  through which schools are able to benefit from a range of favourable terms and  conditions, agreed in the aggregate for eligible non-commercial public sector  bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_13255">In addition to the four Frameworks mentioned above, a Framework for Digital  Projectors for schools is in the process of being established. It is expected  that this Framework will shortly become available to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13256">For procurement where Framework Agreements do not exist, schools are required to carry out normal competitive tendering processes under general public procurement rules.</p>

            <p eId="para_13268">As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer. In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure.  Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_13269">In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance.  The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy. The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_13270">Following discussions at the employment control framework monitoring committee, a revised framework has recently been agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance, and has been conveyed to the Higher Education Authority for application in the higher education system. This revised framework provides institutions with a greater flexibility around recruitment in the filling of posts, on the basis of meeting a required overall reduction in posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_13271">It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions, including  Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework. In the case of DIT, I would consider that the extra flexibility now afforded to all institutions, will facilitate them in dealing with the particular issues that have arisen in that case.</p>

In addition it provides for the development of a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the Education for Persons with a Special Educational Need (EPSEN) Act focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_13314">Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_13315">The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_13316">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_13317">In the meantime, a 2.54 acre site was purchased by my Department to supplement the existing 0.48 acre site to provide a site for a new 6 classroom school.  The site purchase has closed and the site is been transferred to me as Minister for Education and Science.  The process of registering the site is underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_13322">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_13323">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_13324">Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_13325">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_13326">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_13346">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework which promotes regular school attendance and tackles the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that every child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_13347">In May 2009, I announced plans for the integration of educational services under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) with effect from the 1st September 2009.  The integration brings together the Home School  Community Liaison (HSCL), the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the  Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST) as well as the National  Educational Welfare Service under one common management team thereby providing for a single, more focused, strategic direction to tackle attendance, participation and retention at local, regional and national levels reflecting equally the nature and strength of each of the services.</p>
            <p eId="para_13348">The Board has a full time Educational Welfare Officer addressing school attendance issues for all schools on the Northside of Limerick City.  The EWO works as part of a local team and in collaboration with a number of agencies in the area including; SCP, HSCL, VTST, Health Services Executive, the Gardaí, and local Youth Initiatives.  Visiting families in their homes to offer advice and assistance is one of the primary forms of intervention of the NEWB.  The  Moyross area of Limerick is designated under the Limerick Regeneration  Programme.  The EWO is also involved in a number of local initiative addressing educational disadvantage.  These include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_13349">Moyross based weekly NEWB advice and support clinic</p>
            <p eId="para_13350">Member of Northside Youth Forum (targeting young people at risk)</p>

            <p eId="para_13352">Active Member of Regeneration schools groups</p>
            <p eId="para_13353">The NEWB has advised that it received the correspondence, referred to by the  Deputy, in December 2009.  The correspondent expressed concerns about local children who were allegedly involved in anti social behaviour and who were allegedly out of the education system.  The NEWB together with other agencies in Limerick is following up on the educational welfare concerns raised in the correspondence.  The Board also informed me that in its response it advised the correspondent that issues of anti-social behaviour should be referred to the appropriate authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_13501">The Deputy will recall that measures had to be taken in the Budget to safeguard the future payment of income supports in the welfare system by reducing the levels of payments.

            <p eId="para_13502">The Millennium Partnership Fund, introduced by the Government from 2000, was disbursed by local Partnership Companies in disadvantaged areas, mostly in the form of small grants to individual students to cover costs of items such as books and travel.

            <p eId="para_13528">The average annual rental cost for a standard temporary classroom unit for  07/08 school year was €15,428. The average cost for the same unit in 08/09 was  €15,125, a reduction of almost 2%.  The cost per unit varies significantly  depending on the location, size, type and age of each unit.   Another factor  which needs to be considered is that in 07/08 the VAT rate for rental of  temporary accommodation was 21%.  In 08/09 this rate rose to 21.5%.  Therefore,  a portion of the savings in rental costs was offset by this VAT increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_13529">The amount spent on the rental of temporary accommodation in 2008 was almost  €53m.  In 2009, expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation fell  significantly to €39m, a saving of €14m over 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_13530">One change in policy that has been implemented is to grant aid the purchase  (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such  accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. Furthermore, since July  2008, it is my policy to offer schools being approved for grant aid for  temporary accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a  permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.</p>
            <p eId="para_13531">These policies will reduce the usage of temporary accommodation and,  particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs and have contributed  to the saving of €14m on annual expenditure on rental of temporary  accommodation in 2009 as compared to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_13532">In addition, my Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new  procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view  to achieving best value for money. Work is well underway and the firm of  specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit  of my Department. The review incorporates the development of standard  specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual  terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual  local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department  and school authorities. My Department has received a draft of a new contract  for the provision of temporary accommodation which is currently under  consideration. The work on the development of standard specifications is also  well advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_13533">Another strand of the review is negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out  existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate. An  initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been  identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental  contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_13534">A number of these prefabs have now been bought-out and negotiations are ongoing  with a view to ending rental contracts for as many schools as possible in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_13535">In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek  competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of  competitive market prices.</p>

            <p eId="para_13560">To date, the English language sector has been regulated on a voluntary basis by  the Advisory Council for English Language Schools, a company limited by  guarantee which operated under the aegis of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_13561">As I announced last year, under the new framework for promotion and regulation  of international education, the forthcoming amalgamated qualifications agency,  and, in the interim, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI),  will have responsibility for regulation of international education programmes.   As part of this, the staff and functions of ACELS transferred to the NQAI on 1  January 2010.  The NQAI, under the ACELS brand, which continues to have strong  international recognition, will now provide the voluntary quality assurance and  inspection scheme for private sector English language schools. Schools which  comply with the ACELS quality assurance and inspection scheme are approved by  my Department for the purpose of providing English language programmes in the  private sector.  The conditions for recognition of schools are available on the  website www.acels.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_13562">In April 2005 my Department established an Internationalisation Register which  sets out programmes approved for the purpose of access to work by students who  are citizens from outside the EU, EEA and Switzerland. Under the immigration  regime, such students will only be given access to work if they are attending  full time programmes on the Register. The criteria for inclusion require that  the programme be full-time, at least 15 hours per week for a minimum of 25  weeks, and lead to a nationally recognised award, or its international  equivalent. Language programmes which meet the duration criteria and are  approved under the ACELS quality assurance and inspection scheme are also  eligible for inclusion on the Register, provided they offer assessment for  students at the end of the programme using recognised language proficiency test  instruments. The criteria for inclusion are included in an Information Note,  along with the Internationalisation Register, on the Department's website at  www.education.ie. The register is updated on a monthly basis. Responsibility  for the register will shortly be transferred to the National Qualifications  Authority of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_13563">Government recently approved the General Scheme of the Qualifications  (Education and Training) Bill, which provides for the amalgamation of   organisations involved in qualifications and quality assurance in higher and  further education and training (i.e. the National Qualifications Authority of  Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further  Education and Training Awards Council).  The Bill will provide for the setting  up by the new agency of a Quality Mark and Code of Practice for the provision  of educational services to international students. Education and training  providers, including language schools, will be able to apply for a Quality Mark  based on their compliance with the Code of Practice, which will cover such  issues as treatment of fees and support services for international students.  Additional measures will apply to providers of English language courses.</p>

            <p eId="para_13579">The new post-primary school project for Ballinamore, Co Leitrim, is one of  eight schools which I approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be  procured via Public Private Partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_13580">This bundle is in the pre procurement stage. Detailed output specifications and  Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) are being finalised and outline planning  permission has been received in the case of seven of the eight schools.

            <p eId="para_13870">My Department is actively engaged in a programme of administrative and  legislative reform of student grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_13871">A business process re-engineering exercise is being conducted in respect of the  administration of student grants. This exercise, being undertaken as part of  the Government's Transforming Public Services initiative, will involve an  analysis of the existing schemes, services, processes and procedures to  identify the improvements that can be made. It is designed to effect an  enhancement both of the quality of customer service and the efficiency and  value for money of service delivery. Alongside this initiative, the Department  is engaged in the development of a new, more user-friendly application form for  student grants. As part of the overall programme of reform, it is planned to  make application forms available a good deal earlier in the year so that  students can submit grant applications following completion of the CAO process.  It is also planned to introduce earlier closing dates so that the process of  assessing grant applications can be brought forward significantly to enable  early decisions on grant applications to be made by the awarding authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_13952">A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non-examinable subject  at junior cycle was implemented, phased over a 3 year period, beginning in 2003, supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development for teachers. No date was agreed for implementation at senior cycle, and issues concerning the inclusion of PE as an examination subject at Leaving Certificate level remain to be addressed. In the meantime, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has made proposals for a fundamental re-structuring of senior cycle into subjects, short courses and transition units. The proposals included the provision of PE as a subject, and the inclusion of a short course in Sports Studies. It was considered that the inclusion of PE as both a subject and  Sports Studies short course could only be examined within the broader context of plans for senior cycle reform generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_13953">The Council has continued to undertake further analysis and development work with schools on the issue of senior cycle reform. It currently has a specialist committee working on a syllabus for Leaving Certificate Physical Education.  When revised proposals are submitted to my Department, the implementation implications will be examined in the context of the overall priorities and resources available to the education sector at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_13954">This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a new school building or major refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design, and new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13955">A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in  2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_13956">So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the second ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched by the Minister for  Children and Youth Affairs found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across the 40 participating countries in being physically active for at least 60 minutes per day for over 4 days per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_13958">As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for ensuring that child protection requirements are complied with rests with the school board, the principal and the staff of each school. The Inspectorate of my Department undertakes whole-school evaluations in line with its quality assurance remit set out in Section 13 of the Education Act 1998. The WSE process involves evaluating schools under the areas of management, planning, curriculum provision, teaching and learning and student support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13959">The evaluation procedures include a specific review of school policies in the area of child protection. This review involves checking that each school has formally adopted the child protection guidelines as recommended in Children  First and in the child protection guidelines of the Department of Education and Science. Confirmation is sought from the school authorities that the child protection procedures have been brought to the attention of management, school staff and parents and that a copy of the procedures has been provided to all staff (including all new staff). The procedures also involve checking that a  Designated Liaison Person (DLP) has been nominated by the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_13960">The review of a school's child protection policies does not rely solely on the formal confirmation provided by the school authorities. Where necessary inspectors examine the minutes of board meetings, the recorded details of the adoption of the school's child protection policy and official school documentation naming the Designated Liaison Person (DLP). Inspectors may also follow up on any issues with members of school management and staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_13961">Following the checks made by the inspectors in relation to child protection the  relevant findings are included in the WSE inspection report which is provided  to the school's board of management and published on the Department's website.  In addition, the Inspectorate reports its findings to the Schools Division of the Department for follow-up where necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_13967">While Boards of Management have the legal responsibility for the management of schools, I took a view that given the exceptionally difficult and widespread weather conditions that were being forecasted at that time, a central and early decision was required in relation to school closures.

            <p eId="para_13968">This decision was a reasonable and pragmatic decision based on the weather forecast at that time and in a scenario where up to 70% of schools had closed in any event.</p>

This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or when the pupil has left.</p>
            <p eId="para_13976">SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. Furthermore schools can make applications at any time with the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static for a school year in the same way as are for example classroom teaching posts.  The NCSE is independent in the making and issuing of its decisions. Given all the factors involved it is not possible at this stage to predict an outcome of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_14004">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1092 and 1093 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_14005">I am aware of the recommendations of the Children's Mental Health Coalition.  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is  designed to promote positive mental health. It is already supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide  training and advice for schools and a resource directory.</p>
            <p eId="para_14006">Its aim is to foster personal development, health and well being of children,  to help them create and maintain supportive relationships, and develop the  skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_14007">From the beginning of primary schooling children learn, in an age-appropriate  way, how to identify, explore and express feelings and emotions, how to  communicate with others, to resolve conflict and to respect difference, the  importance of caring for one's body, treating oneself and others with dignity  and respect, and how to identify people, places and situations that may  threaten personal safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_14008">The SPHE modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and  integrating, handling conflict constructively, bullying, dealing with peer  pressure, coping with stress, emotional health and well being, influences on  decision-making, and relationships and sexuality education. In third year, an  awareness of the range of agencies who can help students in difficulty is  promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help. SPHE is  designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach  which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_14009">All post-primary schools also provide a guidance and counselling service for  their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this  provision. The service includes the provision of individual guidance and  counselling for students either at critical stages in their education or at  times of personal crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_14010">Schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14 to 18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland on an optional basis as a  module in the Transition Year Programme, an element of the Leaving Certificate  Applied Programme, a component of the SPHE programme or an element of other subjects such as Religion or Home Economics.</p>
            <p eId="para_14011">The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operating within my  Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support  the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary and  post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_14012">The implementation of the SPHE curriculum has been supported by national  programmes of professional development for teachers at primary and post primary level provided by the curriculum support services. These services continue to be maintained in the current school year, but my Department is not in a position to expand them at the present time.</p>

            <p eId="para_14017">The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published  prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the  Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the  Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_14018">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the  context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to  give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_14021">All students who are eligible for means tested student support have the student  charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational  Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee  grant they are entitled to.</p>
            <p eId="para_14022">The student services charge is collected by each individual institution and the  Higher Education Authority (HEA) is currently compiling the 2009/10 enrolment  figures so as to determine the total income generated from the student services  charge by the institutions for the current academic year.  I understand that,  as up to date student number returns are not yet available for all  institutions, it is not possible to supply a breakdown by institution.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_14025">The latest Retention Report published by the Department of Education and Science provides data on the cohort of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 2000 and 2001 most of whom completed their senior cycle five to six years following the year of intake. This is the fourth such report tracking pupil retention and the trend is showing yearly improvements in retention rates — rising from an estimated 81 to 85% for entrants to second level in 1996 and 2001 respectively. It is compiled from data on the Department's Post Primary  Pupils Database and tracks students in State aided schools (with an estimate of  those attaining their Leaving Cert in private institutions). It does not take  into account students pursuing other educational pathways such as Youthreach or apprenticeship training. Retention rates of pupils in Second-Level School   Cohort can be found on my Department's website —<i>www.education.ie</i> under Statistics. </p>
            <p eId="para_14026">Average retention rates to leaving certificate for Cork City and Cork County  for the 2001 Entry cohort were 77.1 and 83.0% respectively. Data relating to  the cohort of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 2002 and  2003 will be available later in 2010.  Note that these rates do not take into  account pupils who leave the State-aided schools including publicly funded  fee-paying schools and move to non-aided second-level education providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_14027">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school  leaving. This includes the work of the National Educational Welfare Board,  established under the Education Welfare Act, 2000, to monitor attendance and  help to get young people back to school. Enhancing attendance, progression,  retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS. Targeted interventions  include the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison  services, visiting teacher service for Travellers, additional funding for pupils at risk of early school leaving and alternative curricular options.</p>
            <p eId="para_14028">From 1st September, 2009, a single co-ordinated School Support Programme  involving the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, the School Completion  Programme and the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers has been integrated  under the National Educational Welfare Board. This development puts in place  structures to facilitate closer integration of the services at local, regional  and national levels, increase effectiveness and help bring about real and  meaningful improvements in services, to confront in a cohesive way, the  underlying causes that impact negatively on the school life of children,  particularly as they relate to school attendance, retention and attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_14029">My Department has also widened the range of curricula available to students by  promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate  Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.</p>
            <p eId="para_14030">I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts  in recent years to keep more young people in school and I will continue to  prioritise further progress in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_14055">The 700 schools referred to by the Deputy were identified in a survey conducted  by my Department in 2005.  The data from this survey has since enabled, my  Department, through its Teacher Education Section, to make additional resources available to provide targeted training in the Stay Safe Programme to these particular schools.  To date more than 500 of the 700 identified have accessed training to support the implementation of the Stay Safe programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_14056">More up to date information in relation to the implementation of Stay Safe is  being gathered and will be compiled as part of the wider LifeSkills survey  which is currently being undertaken by my Department.    In June 2009, my  Department wrote to all primary schools asking them to complete a Lifeskills  Survey.   The survey covers a broad range of areas including implementation of  Stay Safe.  To date responses have been received from 2,542 primary schools and a reminder has issued to those that have not yet responded.</p>
            <p eId="para_14057">Notwithstanding the current position, the Deputy will be aware that I have  recently stated my intention that Stay Safe should be made mandatory for all  schools.</p>

In anticipation of the review and recent updating of Children  First, my Department wrote to all the education partners last Autumn inviting  submissions from them on potential changes that might be desirable to my  Department's existing child protection guidelines to schools. The education  partners were also invited to participate in a working party to review the  guidelines and the working party commenced its work before Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_14059">Ensuring that the Stay Safe Programme is implemented in all schools as part of  a comprehensive set of practices, procedures and guidelines to ensure child safety is important and it for this reason that I have stated my intention to have it included as a mandatory requirement for all schools in any revision to the current arrangements that emerges from the working party.</p>

            <p eId="para_14089">A major capital project at the school to which the Deputy refers is currently at an early stage of architectural planning. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_14090">The proposed building project will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_14091">Turning to the issue of the prefabricated temporary accommodation at the school, in 25th March 2009,  in response to a question raised by the Deputy highlighting the costs of rental of temporary accommodation for schools, I advised that my Department had commenced a review of this area.  I explained that a firm of Chartered Quantity Surveyors had been engaged to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money and reducing overall rental costs for schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_14092">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department's review of the provision of temporary accommodation in schools is well underway.  One aspect of the review involves the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buyout and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_14093">A further strand involves negotiations between the Chartered Surveyors and prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate. An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts. A number of these prefabs have now been bought-out, including the prefabs at the school referred to by the Deputy, and negotiations are ongoing with a view to ending rental contracts for as many schools as possible in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_14094">The Chartered Surveyors carried out a site visit at this school on 26th June,  2009 and provided my Department with a report confirming that the units are in good condition and well maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_14095">On 9th December 2009 the school authorities were informed that my Department had decided to purchase the temporary accommodation units and that this initiative was undertaken to achieve better value for money.  They were also advised that this change in the funding arrangement for their temporary accommodation would not affect any application the school may have for permanent accommodation under the School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_14099">In the current difficult budgetary climate, there will be challenges for our universities in prioritising and managing budgets to maximum effect. In that regard the HEA is working closely with the institutions to effect economies across all levels of activity. I understand from the HEA, who are in consultation with the universities in the matter, that whilst they envisage that there will be some reduction in the number of e-journals available, they are satisfied that they can ensure continued access for all our university students and staff to the most relevant publications across the science, technology, social sciences and humanities domains.</p>

This scheme is currently being piloted in a number of schools.</p>

The Act sets out the role of the NCSE in this regard. In June 2007, Part 2 of the Act was commenced for children less than 5 years of age. Since then, the NCSE has processed 1,462 requests for assistance for such children following receipt of applications submitted by Health Service Executive Assessment Officers nationally.</p>
