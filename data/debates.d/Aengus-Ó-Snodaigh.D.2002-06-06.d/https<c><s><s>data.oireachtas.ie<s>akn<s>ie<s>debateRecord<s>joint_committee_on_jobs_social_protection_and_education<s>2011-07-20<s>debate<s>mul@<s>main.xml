          <p eId="para_25">Before the meeting begins, I wish to raise an issue I also brought up when acting as a substitute at a meeting of the Select Sub-Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While I am aware that officials do not comment in meetings like this, would it be possible to have their names displayed?  That would be nice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_26">The general rule is that when the Minister is present, he or she addresses and takes all questions and gives all answers when he or she can.  It also is open to a Minister to revert with information afterwards.  This is the reason officials' names are not displayed.  However, as the Deputy is aware, all members have been invited to visit the Department next Wednesday, 27 July 2011 to meet the various officials who will be present on the day.  We should take up that offer as a good way to get to know people.  Certainly, when officials attend in the absence of a Minister, their names always are displayed.  I am sure they would love to take all the questions.  We also can forward their names to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">Before we begin, I must again note that members agreed at the first meeting to turn off their mobile telephones.  Although no one disagreed, mobile telephones have been buzzing and so on.  I accept they are not always on the Opposition side of the room and sometimes are on this side but mobile telephones must be switched off because recordings of members' own contributions are being affected.  Consequently, they will not be available for the record or may not be used in other situations.  Telephones must be switched off, as having them on silent mode no longer is good enough.</p>

I am sure we can work together productively and efficiently, as there are many issues members wish to address.  I thank the Minister for attending at short notice.  While I accept we have only an hour in which to discuss this subject, the Minister has attended at short notice.  The idea was to invite the relevant Ministers before the joint committee for a short discussion before finalising the work programme.  I invite the Minister to begin her contribution.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
          <p eId="para_34">Thank you, Chairman for the invitation and am delighted to meet the committee again.  I confirm and reiterate that any committee member who wishes may visit the Department to meet and have discussions with the officials.  As I will not be present, members can ask them whatever they wish and perhaps can find out about the Department's works and all the changes that are taking place at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Second, on foot of Deputy Lawlor's request, seated beside me are Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department, Brian O'Raghallaigh, the assistant secretary in overall charge of budget and finance, Kathleen Stack, another assistant secretary who deals with a wide range of issues in the Department and Claire Conway, an assistant principal officer on the finance side of the Department.  When members visit the Department, they probably will meet some of these officials again and can then talk to them on a one-to-one basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">I was asked to attend to address the issue of priorities for me and the Department and I again thank members for the invitation.  When I appeared before the select committee last week in connection with the Department's spending Estimates, the discussion inevitably touched upon issues that members considered should be priorities for my Department.  For example, the issue of reducing waiting times for claims decisions on appeals was mentioned by many members.  This is a key priority for me, together with four other key priority areas.  The first concerns my Department's role in securing economic recovery through the stimulus effect of social welfare payments, which maintain economic activity, as well as the contribution of social welfare to the achievement of fiscal sustainability in this country in order that we recover our economic sovereignty and independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The second priority refers to what is technically called activation.  It pertains to getting people of working age back into work training or education, as opposed to simply being in receipt of a social welfare payment.  It also aims to maximise employment, to tackle fraud and abuse and to implement the other commitments, such as reforming rent supplement, in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">My Department's overall objective is to promote active participation in society through the provision of income supports and other services.  These services impact on the lives of almost every person in the State.  For example, in 2010 the Department processed some 2 million claims and made more than 84 million payment transactions.  More than 6 million telephone calls were received in headquarter sections and almost 935,000 control reviews were conducted.  The latter are designed to stop fraud and to ensure payments go to the people who are properly entitled to them.  In 2011, 1.4 million people will receive a social welfare payment each week.  When qualified adults and qualified children are included, a total of more than 2 million people will benefit from weekly payments.  In addition to this, child benefit payments will reach nearly 600,000 families with nearly 1.12 million children every month.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">Given that scale of business, it is a major challenge to provide a satisfactory level of service to the public in all parts of the Department at all times.  One of my priorities is to improve processing times, especially in those parts of the Department which are problematic.  It is not acceptable that people have to wait 4.4 weeks on average to have a claim for jobseeker's allowance decided, nor is it acceptable that people have to wait 27 weeks on average to have an appeal determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">These problems arise from the large increase in the numbers of claims and appeals being submitted as a result of the economic downturn.  People who never expected to be unemployed are now unemployed and finding themselves resorting to income support from my Department.  Staff numbers have increased as a result of redeployment from other areas of the Civil Service such as the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Property Registration Authority.  However, while staff numbers have increased from 4,439 at the end of 2007 to 4,836 at the end of 2010, an increase of 8.9%, this has not kept pace with the increase in workloads.  For example, the number of claims received in local offices during 2010 was 548,500, compared to 302,200 in 2007, an increase of 82%.  Similarly, the number of appeals lodged with the social welfare appeals office in 2010 was 32,432, compared to 14,070 in 2007, an increase of 130%.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Several initiatives have been taken to improve matters, including the introduction of more streamlined business processes, new computer systems and the appointment of an additional nine appeals officers, representing a 31% increase.  These were some of my first actions as Minister.  Much progress has been made as a result of these initiatives and through the sheer commitment of staff to providing the best possible service in these circumstances of unprecedented increases in claim numbers.  For example, the number of people awaiting a decision on a claim for jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance is 31,000, compared to 44,000 a year ago, a reduction of 30%.  I attach a high priority to making further progress on further improving claim and appeal processing times this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The Department is pursuing its overall objective of promoting active participation in society in the context of the programme for Government which includes several commitments specifically relevant to the Department of Social Protection and which determine my priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Getting the economy back on its feet is the overriding concern for the Government.  One of the core commitments in the programme for Government is the restoration of fiscal stability.  Overall Government spending in 2011 will be approximately €18 billion more than this year's overall Government income.  That level of Exchequer borrowing is clearly not sustainable.  The total income the Government will get from tax and PRSI in 2011 is €42 billion, of which my Department is expected to spend more than €20 billion, nearly half.  Accordingly, the transition to a more balanced budgetary position simply cannot be made without affecting social welfare spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">This fiscal imbalance is due to many people losing their jobs in the past four years.  Along with the collapse of the banks and the construction sector, there has been a fall in tax revenues and an increase in social welfare spending.  As the economy recovers, we will see a reversal in that trend with a positive impact on the fiscal deficit.  If a person loses his or her job and goes on social welfare, the average cost is €10,000 per annum plus the loss of tax and PRSI.  If the person is the breadwinner for a family, the cost is higher due to the additional payments for dependants.  If we get that person back to work the gain is significant with a reduction in direct payments and an increase in tax revenue and spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">In the meantime, however, as people spend the income they receive in social welfare payments, it maintains employment and sustains economic activity at higher levels than would otherwise be possible.  Social welfare amounts to 16% of gross national product.  One can see what the social welfare spend means to local businesses and shops.  It is an important economic stimulus.  This economic stabiliser effect is an important and positive contribution to economic recovery, provided of course it takes place as part of a viable overall plan leading the economy back to its full growth potential within a reasonable period.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The funding agreement with the EU and IMF commits the Government to a further adjustment of at least €3.6 billion in the 2012 budget including a reduction in expenditure of €2.1 billion.  The Department of Social Protection necessarily has a major contribution to make in achieving a more balanced budget as it accounts for 39% of gross current Voted expenditure, equivalent to 16% of gross national product.  The exact level of contribution that spending on social welfare will make to the overall reduction in expenditure will be decided by the Government later this year, informed by the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure under way in all Departments.  Another part of the funding agreement with the EU and the IMF commits the Department to developing a comprehensive programme of reform that can better target social support to people on lower incomes while at the same time ensuring that work pays for social welfare recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">An interim report is due by the end of 2011 and a final report by March 2012.  This work will build on three reports published by the Department in November 2010, which dealt with child income supports, payments to people of working age and disability allowances.  It also will be informed by the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure in respect of social welfare spending.  My priority will be to ensure that the required reduction in expenditure on social welfare is achieved in an equitable and fair manner between this year and 2012.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_51">In relation to my third priority, activation and maximising employment, we have halved the amount of employers' PRSI payable on employees and the recent social welfare legislation reinstated the national minimum wage.  The national internship scheme, JobBridge, was launched last month to give thousands of unemployed people work experience.  This initiative involved an active collaboration with the private sector.  A steering committee headed by Mr. Martin Murphy of Hewlett-Packard also included other people in industry in commerce in Ireland.  We have received a significant amount of offers from employers and a number of interns are approaching hosts as part of the process of matching candidates with positions.  I have also established an advisory group on tax and social welfare which will harness expert opinion to investigate the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection system with the objective of ensuring work pays, recommending cost-effective solutions to employment disincentives and overcoming poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In regard to identifying specific practical institutional and administrative improvements to our operations, the changes which the Department is undergoing would be very challenging for the commercial sector.  We are taking into the Department up to 1,000 community welfare officers who were previously employed by the HSE.  They are a fantastic resource for activation, counselling and interviewing because many of the supplementary payments they administered will now be provided through local offices with improved turnaround times.  We are also merging with the Department the employment services side of FÁS and up to 800 people will be involved in that process in the coming year.  It is a significant challenge for an organisation that employs 5,000 people to take on an additional 1,800 staff and the Secretary General and the officials in charge of our transformation agenda are working flat out on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Our objective is to provide an automatic process to guide individuals who present at social welfare offices.  It will profile applicants according to their education and experience.  If an applicant is young and an early school leaver, I am anxious that he or she would be advised to consider education and training options rather than going straight onto social welfare.  As someone who worked in education for more than 20 years, I make no apology for that.  If young people cannot find jobs in the current difficult market it is critical that they are given opportunities to train or get involved in education in order to have opportunities to become financially independent when the recession ends.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">I will respond to questions members may have about fraud and abuse but I have already taken on additional powers to integrate task forces comprising social welfare inspectors, gardaí and Revenue and customs officials to address this issue.  Defrauding social welfare is a criminal activity and serious amounts of money are being made by the small number of people who attack the social welfare system for personal gain.  We are drawing up a fresh action plan on fraud and I hope the committee will be in a position to get an in-depth briefing from the departmental officials who are dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Other commitments include reform of rent supplement.  If members have questions on this issue, I am happy to respond to them.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_57">I thank the Minister for providing her statement to the committee in advance.  One of the highest priorities for her Department is making further progress on improving claim and appeal processing times.  Most of us have tabled parliamentary questions dealing with individual cases which are taking too long to process.  She noted that nine appeals officers have been put in place and I hope this will bring results in the coming months.  We should not accept a situation whereby domiciliary care and carer's allowance applications and appeals are taking up to one year to process.  I ask that some type of performance indicator be put in place to measure improvements in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">In regard to economic recovery, the Minister's priority is to ensure the required reduction in spending on social welfare is achieved in an equitable manner.  As head of one of the largest spending Departments, she will have to play a role in meeting her commitments in terms of Estimates and budgets.  What will be the impact of the programme for Government on staffing numbers in the Department?  Are there plans for redundancies or lay-offs in light of the proposal to reduce public sector staffing by 25,000 over a period of five years?  I ask for an assurance that such reductions will not impact on the services or facilities offered by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">I welcome the continuation of the last Government's policy of integrating FÁS and centralising services and supports for employment activation.  I hope these efforts are proceeding apace and that more information will be made available in the near future.  Given that the transfer of staff must be almost complete, I expect we will be able to learn more about the mechanics either today or in the near future.  The measures on internships and reducing PRSI and VAT rates are welcome but they have been described as modest.  What other measures are planned for the specific area of activation?  I am interested in a joined-up approach to education, particularly with regard to preschool and younger children.  If children's allowance is to be means tested or savings are to be made through better-off people not receiving it, the savings should be put towards preschool education because experts tell us the most important aspect of education is not primary, secondary or third level but preschool.  Other European countries have made great strides in this regard.  I hope the committee will take on board a commitment to work with the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills to make huge strides in improving facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The programme for Government has high aspirations for tackling fraud and abuse.  Answers from departmental officials at the previous meeting indicated we are only 10% ahead of what was achieved last year in this regard.  In her responses at the previous meeting, the Minister indicated she is measuring her commitment to maintain rates against the ability to make further savings in this regard.  If there has been an increase of only 10% can the Minister maintain this commitment?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_16" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_61">I thank Deputy Cowen.  I appointed nine extra appeal officers within a month of taking office.  Already we have seen a reduction in the waiting list for appeals on jobseekers payments.  It has reduced by 11,000 compared to this time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">As the Deputy knows, issues arising with regard to carers often have to do with how aspects of the case, such as medical evidence, are presented.  We have a twin strike strategy, part of which is ensuring initial applications are better made with all of the data complete which will enable more decisions to be made at the initial stage rather than a higher level of refusals.  At present, there is a relatively high level of refusals at the initial stage because the medical evidence and paperwork are inadequate.  This may require more co-operation and interaction with doctors who provide the medical evidence.  If we had clearer decisions at the outset of cases which would qualify but are badly presented it would reduce the total volume of appeals.  Having extra appeals officers with a lower level of appeals would allow us to deal with them more quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">With regard to staffing numbers, lay-offs and redundancies the programme for Government includes a requirement to reduce staff numbers in the Department but this is back-loaded over the period of the programme.  There will be modest reductions in 2011 and 2012 with a more significant requirement in 2013.  There is general recognition of the current demand level for services in the Department and the work of the Department.  In the budget for this year and in all of the economic planning documents the previous Government submitted, the estimated average number of people who would claim jobseekers payments this year was 405,000.  The actual average number of jobseekers in the seven months of the year to date is 445,000.  This is a difference of 40,000 per month on average.  Last year, the previous Government forecasted a decrease in economic growth rates, but included in these economic growth rates was a higher level of employment which, unfortunately, did not turn out to be the case.  This is part of the reason for the difficulties with the Department's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">When the integration of FÁS is achieved in the Department - a huge amount of work on this is ongoing and I will meet people from FÁS who are coming to the Department - we will move to having a national employment service or a public employment service.  At present, its clunky title is the national employment and entitlements service, NEES.  This will provide the basis for the integration and the holy grail of a one-stop shop for joined-up welfare, advisory, job placement and training placement services in the framework of a single organisation, preferably located in a single building.  This is achievable in some areas.  At present in Dún Laoghaire, we are working on the new profiling system which will allow people to be referred to FÁS far more rapidly than they are present.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">I share the Deputy's view on the jobs initiative.  I would be happier with far more money to spend on far more jobs initiatives.  When the employment services side of FÁS joins the Department it will include the community employment scheme and local employment services, LES, with which I am sure many people are familiar.  We probably need to think in terms of social employment schemes.  If we have a gap in employment it is essential that we all work together to identify areas where people could work.  Already, I have received representations from Social Justice Ireland on its thinking.  I know other organisations are also thinking about how to generate more activity and employment for people who, unfortunately, find themselves without a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I strongly agree with the Deputy's comments on preschool.  A standard to take from the Finnish banking collapse in the early 1990s is that one of the ways in which that country created social or State-funded employment was to create a quality preschool employment system.  I have been interested in this for decades.  This quality preschool employment system in Finland fed through to its educational activities at all levels.  At present, Finland receives approximately 100,000 visitors a year from throughout the world who go to examine its education system because the outputs it has produced have been striking.  Due to my personal involvement in education I have had many opportunities to speak to people from Finland.  Perhaps we can come before the committee again to discuss it in detail.  Other measures taken by the Finns were to invest in technology and change how mathematics were taught.  People such as engineers were brought into classrooms to revolutionise the approach to mathematics.  There are lessons we can learn from that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_67">I will have another opportunity today to ask questions of the Minister so I will keep this as brief as possible.  I welcome the presentation and acknowledge the fact that staff in the Department are working under huge pressure.  Last week, the Minister came before the select committee and there she acknowledged that approximately 30% of the Department's budget went on older people through pensions and services.  She failed to mention to us that later that day she would slash the household benefits package, despite committee members asking about it.  If the likes of such an announcement is due later on the same day the Minister is before the committee, I hope we and the Houses will be informed of it at that stage instead of learning of it from the website.  The Minister stated that the announcement was tied to a decision of the previous Government, but her approach was mean-spirited and no one was expecting the scale of the cut.  Are further cuts, in particular to the 30% of services for the elderly, due before the next budget?</p>
          <p eId="para_68">I argued activation measures with the previous Government.  What will be their outcome?  According to newspaper reports, three people per week are receiving reduced social welfare payments for refusing to accept supposed job offers or activation measures.  Given the scale of the jobseeker's allowance and the number of people involved, some 440,000 per month according to the Minister, surely this proves that the majority of people are not in a position to be offered jobs.  What constitutes a realistic offer must be defined, given that there are few jobs available.  Many of the courses people are being sent on are chaotic and ill conceived.  Someone who came to my constituency office recently went on a warehousing course that did not have a Safe Pass element, which meant he could not accept any job offer upon completing the course.  Beyond that, his course certificate would not arrive until five months later.  We need to root out all of these problems.  What measures will be taken to ensure the courses offered are realistic as opposed to merely intended to remove people from the live register for a few months?  People should have realistic job opportunities at the end of these courses, which should not be stopgap measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">I would like to tease out a number of other issues with the Minister but, given the short time available, I will leave it at that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_70">I do not deny that the Minister's brief is a difficult one.  Not by choice, many people have found themselves on the dole line or must get jobseeker's allowance.  This is my first opportunity to disassociate myself from the Minister's comments on people treating jobseeker's allowance like a lifestyle choice.  Since her remarks, I have spoken to many people who are angry that this has become the main element of the Minister's brief in the past week.  I have spoken to neighbours and friends who have lost their jobs during the recession and cannot find others.  The tag of "lifestyle choice" has devastated them.  Parents want their children to work, but they need jobs to do that.  We need to be careful about the type of language we use in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The Minister stated that there are nine extra appeals officers to deal with the backlog.  While this is welcome, there is another side to the coin.  I used to work in a semi-State company.  When one is under pressure, facing a large queue of angry or upset people can be difficult.  The Minister was CCed in on a letter I received from someone who, like many others, believed he or she had been badly treated at a counter.  People are under pressure and not everyone is acting badly, but we should consider how front line staff deal with that pressure.  They are not receiving extra staff, yet they are trying to tackle a difficult situation in which many people are applying for jobseeker's allowance or other benefits for the first time.  We should consider how to support our front line staff so that people do not feel as bad when they walk away from the counter.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The elephant in the room is jobs.  Another Minister will attend shortly to address this matter.  Does the Minister, Deputy Burton, believe it will be resolved in the next two, three or four years?  The Minister's budget is coming under increasing pressure, which will put greater pressure on her to cut social welfare payments.  Like Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I asked her whether there would be cuts next year, to which she replied she could not comment.  That afternoon, though, she made her announcement.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">I hope the committee and I will have an opportunity to discuss the reduction in the household benefits package.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The Department of Social Protection is one of the major bulk purchasers of a wide range of important utility services, particularly for older people, from the ESB, Bord Gáis, RTE, coal suppliers, liquefied petroleum gas suppliers and so on.  When I entered the Department, I was astonished to learn that, despite spending more than €500 million on purchasing utilities, we effectively receive no discounts.  Perhaps we could pursue this matter collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">One of last week's cuts to which members referred was a better deal from Eircom in respect of telephones.  I will explain.  Believe it or not, and it probably applies to half the people in the room, including me, but a person can rent his or her telephone handset for up to €2 per month under the deal with Eircom.  One can buy a nice handset from any supermarket or electrical supplier for €20 or €25.  If one bought them in bulk, I suspect one would pay €10 each.  One of the Senators in attendance could probably indicate the bulk price.  It is amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">When someone becomes a pensioner at 66 years of age, his or her handset is rented for the rest of his or her life at roughly €2 per month.  The cut was about getting a discount from Eircom.  It is a bit of an achievement, not a cut.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">The reconfiguration of this important part of the household package will save a significant amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The second change related to smoky coal and smokeless fuel.  An additional €3.90 was being paid for smokeless fuel in smokeless areas.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has made a good proposal to extend smokeless fuel areas to incorporate practically the whole of the country during the coming period.  Doing so would have required a large increase in spending by my Department.  However, examining coal merchants' prices for smokeless fuel and smoky coal shows there is little difference between the two.  The previous Government acknowledged this to be the case.  This was one of the changes made.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">The third change relates to a reduction from 2,400 to 1,800 per month in the number of ESB-equivalent units.  More than 20% of people, particularly older people, use approximately 1,400 units per month.  They will get 1,800 units per month from the Department.  I hope we will not have a severe weather event three years in a row but if there is, we will look at the issue in that light.  I assure the Deputy that community welfare officers have the authority to make additional fuel payments.  It does not give me any pleasure to be involved in any action of restriction or cutback, particularly with regard to older people, but there is a profound case to be made for getting much more value from the €500 million spent by the Department as a bulk payer for utility services.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The reduced social welfare payments power was introduced in last year's Social Welfare Bill, and it commenced in April after I became Minister.  I strongly feel there is an obligation on a person receiving a jobseeker's payment.  Such people are entitled to receive the support of the State because they are unemployed and, as Deputy Joan Collins noted, the employment issue is a genuine difficulty.  I agree with such sentiments, as I have noted before.  However, if somebody receives a jobseeker's payment, that person also has a responsibility in a social contract and must actively engage with opportunities.  I do not apologise for saying that.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Deputy Ó Snodaigh has stated that some of the training courses are not good and the Minister for Education and Skills will come before the committee shortly.  We must improve those training courses, some of which are unacceptable.  Like Deputies I have spoken to many people who have had good and bad experiences on training courses and in education.  In this country we must have a conversation to change our concept of social protection.  The social contract is effective during one's working life of approximately 40 years; a person contributes tax and PRSI, and if that person falls into unemployment the system is there to provide income support.  A person has a responsibility to take up training, employment and work experience opportunities.  We want to make that process meaningful and I agree with Deputy Joan Collins's argument that we should reform and expand such opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">I have been delighted with the support of the private sector for the JobBridge programme.  It is not perfect but there are more than 700 very good quality and interesting internships on the website.  There were some posts advertised that should not have qualified as internships, and we are constantly monitoring the website so we can remove those advertisements.  There are important opportunities and a wide range of small, medium and large employers across Ireland have offered opportunities for the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">This is a start and we will need time to get numbers up.  We must reconsider the role of community education, which is very valuable in local communities and in social employment.  This is as opposed to simply paying people social welfare and not giving them an opportunity to contribute to society and the local community.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I thank the Minister for attending the committee.  I asked the Minister about the possibility of tweaking the jobseeker's allowance so that people who may get a couple of hours work every week would not be penalised.  Could that be considered generally?  I have a number of ideas regarding social welfare fraud as I was doorstepped for 45 minutes by somebody who worked on the bottom rungs of the social welfare system.  I often wonder if we get value for money from the inspectors.  For example, there are 11.5 inspector positions serving Kildare but only 30 inspections were conducted last year, yielding ten infringements.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">A number of reports were published for November 2010 that will have a bearing on the comprehensive review of expenditure.  Is the documentation on the website or can it be e-mailed to me?</p>

As with other representatives, I am concerned about the number of refusals for carer applications, disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance.  Despite the number of refusals some 50% are overturned on appeal, which is a concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">With regard to the transfer of the community welfare officer programme, it has been indicated that this will, in effect, create a new organisation providing efficient and complimentary income, maintenance and related services to families and children, people of working age and retired and older people.  That is exactly what community welfare officers do now.  Will a new role be defined for them?</p>
          <p eId="para_90">We would need five hours to discuss everything in this document, particularly social welfare fraud.

I have referred to the position of one gentleman umpteen times and I have written to the Minister several times, receiving the same pat letter in return.  This 92 year old will be dead by the time he gets a result from his appeal.  I am utterly frustrated by the process.  I appreciate that the Minister has appointed nine extra people but this would have been the first topic I raised after my election and nothing has happened.</p>

Recent information I received indicated a high level of success with appeals.  Will the Minister confirm the 40% figure?  It seems that 40% of those 32,000 appeals related to bad decisions.  Is there a process within the Department to review decisions based on successful appeals, perhaps examining procedures and, if necessary, retraining deciding officers?</p>
          <p eId="para_96">My constituency includes Dublin Airport and I meet many people working there.  There is anecdotal evidence that non-Irish nationals are coming and going while collecting social welfare payments.

Has the Department considered examining the link between the numbers of people on welfare who are also suffering anxiety and depression?  I see a correlation between the two in those who come to my constituency office.  I refer to the long-term unemployed in particular.  We must ward against this and put in place preventative measures.  These people are framing their lives in a welfare dependency mode.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I was alarmed, as I am sure was the Minister, by the discrepancy between PPS numbers and the population, amounting to 2.6 million people.

In areas of high unemployment with young men out of work as a result of the contraction in the construction industry, much of the work that can be done in these communities, such as environmental enhancements, allotments, community gardens and working with schools so they can see the nature, plants and vegetables part of their primary school curriculum operating in the real world, does not fit the mould of the community employment schemes, even though the latter are valuable.  The Minister should invite suggestions from communities, which are keen to be involved in such schemes and activation measures.  Rather than trying to fit the existing mould, we should create a structure around the ideas and enthusiasm people have about making a positive impact in their communities.  We should structure schemes around the ideas people bring in rather than the other way around.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_107">We could have separate meetings with the agenda set by each of the questions raised.  I am anxious that members of the committee who want to meet departmental staff and take an interest in specific areas can be facilitated.  I am on a steep learning curve because of the enormous complexity and breadth of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Regarding Deputy Lawlor's comments on social welfare fraud, we will launch a new drive and an action plan against fraud from September.  I would like to see the social welfare equivalent of a fraud squad.  The important thing is that inspectors revisit and make connections.  There should be a knowledge and a confidence in the community that people defrauding social welfare will not have a free ride on the backs of those who are working and elderly people.  In many ways, it is the money of elderly people that is being taken and it leaves less money for them.  Away from party partisan lines, we could share much of our knowledge and experience.  Regarding Senator Kelly's comments, I hope to launch that in September and I would welcome an opportunity to revert to this point.  The headquarters of the Department dealing with fraud are in Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford.  It may be possible at some stage to meet the staff involved in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The critical point concerns the comments of Deputy Brendan Ryan regarding Dublin Airport, which is near my constituency.  I am familiar with his concern that people may be coming to and from the country but not living and seeking work in this country.  Therefore, they do not qualify for payments but they are on our books.  We need joined up interaction between the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  I met the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to discuss their interaction with us with regard to social welfare fraud.  The Revenue Commissioners collect PRSI on behalf of the Department.  Regarding the Customs and Excise, there is quite an amount of fraud along the Border.  Joint patrols and joint action teams are vital in combating fraud, and sharing intelligence and information is vital.  In Australia, if one is in receipt of income support, there is an entitlement to have sight of one's bank account.  Ireland does not do that but if large transactions are going through bank accounts, perhaps there should be a warning to alert people so that large transactions can be checked.  Other countries have adopted various techniques and every penny saved in this area can go to someone entitled to a legitimate payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">One of the critical points about Deputy Lawlor's comments is that the vast increase in applications means inspectors have to do more paperwork and processing.  Under the new action plan, I hope to have more inspectors freed up from desk jobs and contacting individuals and employers to ensure they are employing people registered for social welfare purposes.  Many Deputies have raised the following point privately with me and I do not have an answer to it.  There is a problem in our system in that if people work for short periods of one month, it is easy to sign off but it can be difficult to come back into the system.  People are fearful they will lose their status, particularly if they have medical cards and rent supplement, and they tell me they will have to go back to square one.  We need to examine this but I do not have an answer.  It is worth examining because we must encourage people, even if is just one month's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Regarding Deputy Conaghan's point on working opportunities and Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor's point on schools, we need to put on our thinking caps.  Deputy Joan Collins asked when the employment situation will turn around.  In modern economies, employment tends to follow economic growth with a lag.  Sometimes one gets what is known by economists as jobless growth.  We must intervene and re-examine community and social employment schemes.  I have had quite a number of meetings with Social Justice Ireland on how we might do this and give people who want to work a chance.  Employers also have a responsibility to give people an opportunity, particularly young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The appeals case Deputy McFadden raised is scheduled for appeal in the next two weeks.  I will give her more advice at the end of the meeting.  Several other Deputies raised the social welfare appeals system.  Payments for carers, for example, are based on medical evidence.  If the evidence is inadequate, it goes to appeal at which better medical evidence is usually produced.  This results in the appeal being successful.  The success rate stands at 52%.  If the Department got a better first application, better decisions would be made at the initial stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Senator Kelly asked about the role of community welfare officers.  The way social welfare is moving means many more payments are being made directly.  The time for old style supplementary welfare allowance payments made temporarily while allowance decisions were being decided is being reduced.  The community welfare officers being transferred to my Department will be an important resource.  They are experienced and used to dealing with people on a one-to-one basis.  As well as issuing supplementary and emergency payments, they have an important role in interviewing and advising people to find a path from unemployment into education, training and work.  Many of the FÁS employees also have skills in that area too.  As the OECD states on moving to an activation system, advising and helping people to get into employment takes time.  It takes people of a certain maturity, experience and training to assist in this.  Many of the new officials coming into the Department will have these skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">There was a suggestion by Deputy Joan Collins that some people were treated roughly in social welfare offices.  Social welfare staff do their absolute utmost to treat everyone with respect.  They have faced a tremendous increase in the numbers of people they face.  Training has been made available to assist staff in dealing with those attending social welfare offices who may be upset and unhappy at being there, having never been in one before and faced with a new system.  We will certainly try to improve our communications but senior management has ordered that everybody is to be treated with dignity and respect.  In the majority of cases they are.  If people feel they have been badly treated, they can inform Deputy Joan Collins and we will look at how we can improve.  The staff have been working very hard and pride themselves on the quality of treatment they give to people.</p>

This would have to be paid for which would mean a major change in the system.  Self-employed people pay social insurance for the old age, widow and widower's pension but do not contribute for unemployment or illness benefits.

With the permission of the Chair, I will refer briefly to the letter I sent to the committee secretariat some days ago, which, I understand, was circulated to members.  We have listed our nine priorities, literacy, the education (amendment) Bill, qualifications and quality assurance (education and training) Bill - introduced the next day, further education, teacher education, options for higher education.

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_126">I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and their colleagues from the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister has dealt with the Estimates and has taken questions in the Dáil so most of the issues have been covered recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">At the previous meeting my colleague, Deputy Conaghan and I raised the need to give further education an identity of its own.  We raised this during Question Time as well.  It is unsatisfactory that it is literally appended on to the second level sector.  In the context of the establishment of a skills agency and rationalisation of vocational education committees, is the Minister considering a specific further education sector?  If so, would that encompass adult literacy, community education, back to education initiatives and Youthreach?  The delivery of those services has been exemplary in recent years, it is a very cost effective model and it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">In the circulated script, the Minister refers to a 750% increase in the number of appeals on enrolment policy.  Is the figure for the success rate of appeals readily available?  My understanding is that in the past a very small percentage of decisions were overturned on appeal.  I do not know if that is accurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The Minister hopes to have legislation on the rationalisation of vocational education committees through the Oireachtas during the course of 2012.  Will that mean the new entities will be established in 2013?  I reiterate my party's support for the overall proposal to establish 16 VECs, but whether we agree with the particular entities, we agree with the rationalisation of the VECs.  The message needs to go to the personnel who work in the VECs that their employment is secure and those currently employed will not lose their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">I welcome the publication of the literacy strategy, and the need for a wider community approach to improving children's literacy and numeracy skills.  The emphasis is on the importance of the parents' positive role which is necessary to enhance their children's interest and aptitude towards reading and maths.  One issue that my colleague, Deputy Michael Kitt has raised is the investment in libraries.  The network of libraries and their infrastructure has been considerably enhanced in recent years.  We need further investment, but it would be useful if the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills could take a joint approach.  New library facilities have been established in my county and I know they are heavily used.  It is very important for children, who may not have access to computers or reading material at home, that they should be able to avail of these facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">A new pilot patronage model was announced in 2007, the community national school.  I understand that the five schools established in the greater Dublin area under this model have been working very well.  Has any research been undertaken on the success and value of the new community national school model?  I advocated previously that the vocational education committee should be considered for the patronage role at primary level.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_50" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_132">I will ask Deputy Cannon to deal with the first item, further education, for which he has primary responsibility.  I will deal with the other issues briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">All committee members may not be aware that a discussion document prepared in the Department was issued quite recently to all the education partners and stakeholders on the issue of enrolment for primary and post-primary schools.  We have asked all those we have contacted - members should feel free to respond as individuals or parties as they choose - to make submissions by 28 October.  This has been driven by several issues - we do not have the statistics on the rate of successful appeals, but I will have that information communicated to the Deputy.  Essentially a problem has arisen when people who have moved from one town to another go to put the child's name down for secondary school and find that children have been on the list since they were three or four months old.  That is certainly the experience in parts of Dublin.  There are issues about fairness and whether the children of teachers in the school should have priority.  We can understand that siblings should have priority and in the North of Ireland we have seen the disruption of families when some children qualify to go to one school and not another, although that system is in the process of changing.  It is not that the Department wants to start directing schools as to how to enrol students, we want the maximum level of autonomy in how pupils are enrolled but the issues that have arisen have led to a massive increase in litigation.  I do not have the statistics on the outcome of those cases, but I will send the information to the Deputy.  It is a problem, and we hope that at community and local school level we will get a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">On the rationalisation of VECs, I acknowledge the work done by my predecessor and Deputy Smith's colleague, the then Deputy Batt O'Keeffe who initiated the rationalisation of the VECs.  It was published during the time of his successor, the then Tánaiste and Minister, the former Deputy Mary Coughlan.  The configuration was 16 new combinations from the 33 existing vocational education committees.  I accepted that rationalisation but disputed some of the configurations, for example, Tipperary was being split into two different configurations, one with Waterford and the other with Clare and using the GAA colours I have put Tipperary North and South into one VEC.  I did likewise with County Cork, combining the county and city VECs to come up with the same sort of configurations.  The 22 chief executive officers with permanent job status must be accommodated into 16 posts and there are ongoing discussions between them and their representative organisation and management in the Department to see how they will arrive at a resolution so that we can identify 16 lead CEOs for the new entities such as Cavan-Monaghan in Deputy Smith's case.  When that is done, and it is at the discussion stage currently, a decision will be made on the location of the headquarters for the new VEC entity.  There is no question of anybody currently working for a VEC losing out as a consequence of the rationalisation.  If they are permanent employees they will remain permanent in the system.  If they are temporary, it will depend on the demand for labour and that will be dealt with in the normal process and they will retain all the rights they currently have.  None of the existing rights that anybody in the system has will be threatened as a result of the proposed integration.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">In respect of future legislation, I intend to bring the heads of the Bill, that is the draft legislation, to this committee so that we can talk through it together rather than presenting members with something that has gone through all the process internally behind closed doors between the Department and the Attorney General.    On this side of the bench, there is reluctance to open it up again, not necessarily from the politicians but having regard to the nightmare of negotiation Secretaries General and officials have gone through with the Attorney General and others.  Rather than go down that route I will bring to the members a draft form known as the heads of a Bill and, with their agreement, we will discuss it.  Some of the issues will not be contentious but there will be some meat, so to speak, on the rest of it and political input will be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">When the heads of the Bill are discussed we will then put it into legislative form and I expect it will be enacted as early as possible in 2012.  Once that happens, the two committees, whether it is Carlow-Kilkenny, Cavan-Monaghan or whatever, will meet as one committee in an enlarged form and will continue to meet.  There will be no reduction in the numbers.  Anybody currently a member of a vocational education committee, VEC, will remain a member of a VEC even if that VEC is now co-joined with another county until the local elections in 2014.  In 2014, the legislation will have provided as to what the size of the committees will be in the various configurations related in part, I suspect, to population but that is something we will discuss together.  Everybody currently on a VEC, and I speak specifically about county councillors who are elected as the cycle is with the county council elections, will be in place until the next local elections.  I have had some experience in the past regarding mergers.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I take the point about the literacy strategy and investment in libraries.  In some counties there is a better relationship between library services and schools.  Many of the members, like me, are graduates of local authorities and they will know that the libraries are very different now from what they were years ago.  There is the full spectrum of IT including electronic, video, DVDs, talking books and so on in addition to access to computer terminals.  It is easier to do it if a school is in the middle of a town that has a library than one located in the countryside but I would urge closer co-operation between libraries and the VECs.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">On the question of education in the community national schools and the VECs, I am not aware that a comprehensive evaluation has been done yet on that.  They have not been that long on the ground, so to speak, but we are monitoring the way they function.  I am waiting for the forum on patronage to conclude its deliberations before we make any decision on how the community national schools will function alongside other patron bodies.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCannon" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_51">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
          <p eId="para_139">I agree with Deputy Smith that serious fragmentation is occurring within the further education sector and that has been the case for many years.  Within a very short time, having assumed the role in my portfolio and having attended a number of functions, particularly awarding certificates to those who have gone through our further education system, it soon became apparent that the fragmentation the Deputy referred to is very much present within the system.  There is also a very large amount of unnecessary duplication even within towns and counties, all funded by the State, in terms of different bodies delivering effectively the same kind of further education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The Deputy is correct that there is no over-arching vision or one single entity charged with delivering further education and training.  It is a system that has almost grown organically in recent years and in general, and certainly in the case of further education, it is appended to our VEC system across the country.  If we are serious about lifelong learning and the priority we should afford to lifelong learning it is essential to have a dedicated single body with an over-arching vision as to the reason we want to provide further education, what we need to deliver from it and how we should go about doing that.  That must factor into the up-skilling and training sector also.  A great deal of discussion and study is occurring within the Department on how we provide that over-arching vision and who will be responsible for making and delivering the vision.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The Deputy also spoke about literacy.  I met the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, two weeks ago and it highlighted for me the real challenge within the further education system for people whose literacy skills are very low.  It is often the case that the people with whom we seek to interact are those who left school not long after their junior certificate.  We have a large cohort of people within the ranks of the unemployed, particularly those from the construction sector, whose skills levels are quite low.  They left school during a time when the construction sector was booming and assuming it would be there forever.  We now find it is not.  It is a major challenge to interact with those people and to retrain them and allow them the opportunity to get back into the workforce, restore their dignity and begin to make a contribution to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">NALA pointed out that many of those who begin to interact with our further education and training sector have very low literacy levels and NALA suggests that we incorporate literacy modules into almost all our training programmes for those who need to access those modules or perhaps seek to retrain our instructors and tutors in our further education and training sectors to be able to deliver literacy intervention, if it is required, in the classroom or the lecture room.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The Deputy's points are valid and I hope that within a short timeframe we will be able to produce reports and suggestions as to how we can provide that over-arching vision, and who will deliver it, and seek to interact in a meaningful way with the large number of people who need to access further education and retraining.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_52">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_144">I have several questions on the programme and on the Minister's contribution.  The first is on the literacy aspect, which I suppose is a broader issue.  There have been major changes in Traveller education with the loss of 800 primary and post-primary posts, all senior Traveller training centres are due to be phased out by 2012, the link with many from a Traveller background in regard to literacy and so on.  Will the Minister examine that as a separate issue in the literacy debate?  How does he intend to address the issue of the changes signalled in regard to Traveller education, which is a major issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_145">We spoke about the governance issue during the debate on the Estimates in respect of some of the universities and what appeared to be abuse and waste of funding in that regard.  Does the Minister intend to examine that area as part of his programme during the year?</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The Minister spoke about the importance of having a fair and transparent system of enrolment.  We would all agree with that but one of the difficulties is that if a child has specific needs, that creates problems in terms of trying to get into the system.  That leads me to my next question.  While the Minister was away there was a Private Members' motion on the area of special needs assistants, SNAs, and the difficulty regarding that in the education system.  As elected representatives we all get representations on certain difficulties that some families face in that regard.  Does he intend to examine that area?  There are many statistics in the value for money report, which I understand is two years old, but it also mentions the pressure being put on the system in that regard.  Does the Minister intend to examine that whole area to ensure that rather than the schools taking on the pressure of the SNAs, a separate structure, whether it be under the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, or some other structure, would take some of the pressure from schools?  That is an area the Minister might examine.  I am keen that come September this committee would examine that area because that is when the difficulties arise and we can get a better sense of what is happening on it.   My colleague will ask some questions later on.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The Minister also referred to the literacy model and support.  In my local authority area a successful model, the connect programme, has been introduced in schools.  It is IT-based and support comes from the local authority.  Has the Minister been in discussions with other local authorities to roll out similar programmes?  The programme to which I refer has won awards.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">On initiatives, the Minister referred to the school book programme, recycling books and so on.  Another initiative announced last year concerned school uniforms.  Groups like Barnardos and others raised the issue.  Is it something the Minister can pilot?  We all know many families will face huge difficulties due to the recession in terms of funding their children.  The cost of sending a child to school has sky-rocketed.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">I refer to institutes of technology and universities, to which the Minister referred.  We need joined up Government policy on this.  Many institutes of technology and universities recruit students from abroad, such as China and so on, to try to match funding.  Many buildings are lying idle in NAMA.  We need to think outside the box.  Using such buildings would supplement the local economy, help the education system and bring more students into the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_53" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_150">The Deputy has covered a number of issues.  If I respond very quickly to them he should not take brevity as simplicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I cannot stress how important I consider literacy to be.  The Constitution recognises the primary role of the parent as the educator of children.  I have said loud and clear on many different occasions that a child who goes to bed at night without having had a story read to him or her is a child that is being deprived of a unique experience.  All the educational specialists - there are qualified teachers at this meeting - will point out that, by the time a child for whom discourse, reading and learning are part and parcel of the everyday experience and a child who does not, unfortunately, have that experience arrive in junior infants the gap has opened up between them.  Parents have a role in this and I would like to see schools engaging with parents and telling them how they can help.  Some parents may not have had a good experience of school and may feel intimidated about it.  I will not start talking about this because I will not stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">We will not test children.  There is a professional aversion among some teachers, and it is not confined to Ireland.  The British experience under New Labour was far from successful.  If one is cooking one tastes the mixture to see if there is enough salt or spice.  If we are to have standardised measurements in second class, fourth class, sixth class and second year it makes sense to measure how well a child has learned, so that when that child moves with an educational passport, to use a colloquial phrase, when he or she arrives in a new post-primary school with a set of books, a uniform and a passport, the teacher can know if the child has a difficulty with mathematics, reading or whatever.  The child who could be in a class of up to 130 pupils would not have to wait until Easter before the teacher finds out that there is a difficulty.  As some Deputies and Senators will know the brilliant and very weak children very quickly manifest themselves.  They are not the issue; it is person who is sliding under the radar who does not surface but who needs help.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Children go to school to learn to read so that they can read to learn.  By the time a child goes into first year if he or she cannot read at the level at which he or she can continue to learn, he or she is in the departure lounge.  By the time he or she is in second year and is 14 or 15 years of age, he or she is heading towards the exit.  It is a tragedy.  The committee should feel free to invite people behind the literacy strategy to come before it.  When the draft document was published last November it got an enormous response.  The people involved will be more than happy to discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">On education specialism and Travellers, the most suitable approach is to mainstream such children in the education system.  We have received that advice from professional educators.  We are trying to include them in DEIS schools and our preference for further education is for Travellers to be involved on the senior side.  They should be given some degree of priority and preference.  Keeping them separate was a policy initiated before my arrival and the arrival of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, that we have inherited.  I do not agree with it and that is why we are mainstreaming those children.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">The governance of higher education was referred to briefly.  There is concern within the Department, which I share, about payments that we believe should not have been made in the manner in which they were.  We have asked the Comptroller and Auditor general to conduct a complete examination of what has happened over time and to give a report.  When we receive that we will decide how to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, dealt with the debate on SNAs last week and I will ask him to speak, if he wishes, on that issue.  The system has been capped at 10,575.  It has increased a thousandfold from when it was introduced.  There is a great deal of discussion within the professional educational community, including teachers, on the appropriate use of them in the classroom and how they can be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The value for money report stated quite clearly that the original mission of the SNA as envisaged has drifted.  I will allow the Minister of State to outline where we go from here.  We have 4,000 primary and secondary schools, 10,500 SNAs and about 60,000 teachers.  We have to consider how we redeploy resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">On school books and uniforms, I met the Society of St. Vincent de Paul recently.  It has done an enormous amount of work and is probably better equipped to report the difficulties at the coalface for families struggling to pay for both.  We are examining both issues.  In the census form that goes to primary schools which has to be filled out in October each year, as some committee members will be aware, we are asking 3,200 primary schools for the first time if they have a school book lending scheme and, if so, how it functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">We need to see what is out there.  We will write to all 730 post-primary schools asking what schemes they have.  I met two representatives of the school publishing system.  The jobs and employment component is on the publishing side.  Most of the printing is done elsewhere.  We discussed the revisions of textbooks which prompt a change in books.  There will be no initiative this year because we need to get data on lending schemes and how we can co-ordinate activities with the publishers.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">While we set curriculums at national level and the State Examinations Commission sets exams, schools and teachers have a degree of discretion in the books they select.  On school uniforms, we need a commonsense approach.  I would be interested in suggestions from members.  If schools can decide to have grey, maroon, blue, green or red-----</p>

The Minister stated he would undertake a national campaign to alert parents to the importance of reading to children and I ask him to do that.  I refer to the appointment of classroom assistants.  The former Minister said she would introduce community employment schemes and in my view this is a very good idea, particularly in large classes and in junior infants classes.  I ask the Minister to look again at the role of the SNA, special needs assistant, as it needs to be expanded.  I ask him to write to school principals because many parents have not been informed of the supports available next September to their children with special needs.  This is very unfair on parents.</p>

Previously if a gaelscoil had 15 or 25 students, it could apply to become a gaelscoil in a locality but I believe the Department is carrying out surveys.  In general, gaelscoileanna are not the majority desire in an area but they usually attract significant demand once they are up and running.  We would not like to see that excellent stream hampered in any way.  Some secondary schools, the gaelcholáistí, do not have textbooks in Irish for a number of different subjects.

Reading is the key and I welcome his strategy.  Will he consider asking the NCCA to devise guidelines so that second level teachers are required to teach a learning how to learn component, independent learning skills, in each subject class?  This is why rote learning is emphasised above those critical skills.  That is a critical question.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">The Minister is still short of time and therefore we are still in a rush.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I am delighted with the Minister's renewed focus on literacy and numeracy.  I reiterate the question.  The Minister rightly said that learning to read is critical to reading to learn.  We have a problem at second level whereby the system is reliant on grinds to get children over the bar, so to speak.  There is something fundamentally wrong with a public education system, with the amount of investment of resources allocated to it, in which grinds are so prevalent.  I spent €75 a week last year to get my own son through the junior certificate.  It is wrong at every level.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">First, will the Minister ask the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to provide guidelines to ensure that each subject teacher adopts learning how to learn strategies and approaches, and practises them in the class with the students, by subject?  That will ensure the children will acquire independent learning strategies as opposed to rote learning strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Second, regarding school libraries, I understand from many sources that schools need help setting up and maintaining class libraries because space is a consideration and they often do not have room for a school library.  Would the Minister consider giving support in that area by tying in the librarians, the teachers and the parents because as he said, a child who is read to at home is at an incredible advantage?</p>

They are not the top students but they are the students who fall gradually into the section that will need help.  They can read but they do not read.  Will the Minister examine measures that could help in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I thought there was a God when I heard the Minister's proposals to introduce 50% continuous assessment in the junior certificate.  We know children learn differently and perform differently in internal examinations.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">Would it be possible to make career guidance teachers available to students when the leaving certificate results come out?  While there has been much talk about special needs assistants, there is a real need for adequate resources to be provided for occupational and speech therapists in schools.  There are not enough adequate places available for children with moderate special needs who leave school, particularly in south Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.</p>

I am delighted to be a member of this committee having worked for 32 years in first, second and third level education.  I am interested in the Minister's literacy and numeracy project in that it includes auralacy, as it is extremely important across education.  A great let-down in the university system is that one does not have to be qualified to teach in one.  Senator Quinn also referred to the level and quality of teaching in universities and I am delighted this is part of the Minister's agenda.</p>

Will this be reviewed with their time in Gaeltacht areas increased and changes made to when they go there?</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Regarding the balance between research and teaching, various university principals claim ideal college lecturers would teach 40% of the time, research another 40% of their time and make themselves available to students for the remaining 20%.  Research is not confined to people in laboratories.  One must renew oneself as a teacher as do politicians or retailers.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Research in that sense is as much applicable to someone teaching history as to someone developing cutting edge technology.  Science Foundation Ireland and the PRTLI, Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions, made moneys available in an innovative way in that it forced collaboration between different institutions and departments with some very good outcomes.  There are mixed views as to the balance between the payback from the commercialisation of research products to enhancing the ability of a researcher or their collaborative efforts.  The jury is still out as these are relatively young programmes but they are infinitely better than what preceded them.  International indicators show we are very high up in specialist research areas, even world leaders in several of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Based on the value for money report on special needs, how we assist children with special needs must be revisited.  As a non-professional educator, I am hearing conflicting opinions on this matter.  The value for money report called for a review of the programme.  The special teaching assistants, which is a different matter, is an issue that could be raised.  I would welcome an input from the committee in this regard.  It can take the views of and question all the specialists in this area and form its own review.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">I am familiar with the school in question in Donaghmede.  There were 13 ABA, applied behaviour analysis, schools which dealt with autism teaching on pretty much a one-to-one basis.  The staff were not qualified teachers but more qualified specialists and psychologists.  After a long four-year negotiation between different players in the education sector, those 13 schools have been mainstreamed.  The staff are paid as teachers.  I had the honour of re-opening the Drogheda ABA school as a mainstream one.  This is an area where there are divided opinions, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Regarding Senator Healy Eames's questions, part of the strategy for literacy and numeracy is to extend the three-year teacher training programme for primary to four years, with the final year being set in the classroom.  Teachers have to go back to learning how to teach.  Regarding Senator O'Donnell's similar question on college lecturers, the Hunt report specifically stated lecturers also have to learn how to teach.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">If the spend on grinds by Senator Healy Eames to get her son through the junior certificate is indicative, it would be an interesting statistic to present to the teaching profession as to why so much money is spent on grinds.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_212">It will start with the next cohort of students.  With a massively increasing school-going population, we no longer have the luxury of people describing themselves as history teachers.  I want to hear, "I am teacher who currently is teaching history".  A history teacher must have as much responsibility for literacy as distinct to getting the facts correct for, say, the date of the Battle of Clontarf.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">There has been mission drift in the teaching colleges.  There used to be a point where people were called to training, as the phrase went, with a two-year course at Mary Immaculate College or St. Patrick's College.  While it is welcome that most teachers now have a university degree and teacher training is part of the university system, they must get back to the skill of teaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Mr. Harold Hislop, chief inspector, and Mr. Alan Wall, director, Department of Education and Skills, told this committee in January why more boys than girls are reluctant readers of school library books.  Most books in school libraries are romantic stories.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">Most of the books tend to be female orientated.  Mr. Eamon Murtagh, assistant chief inspector, told the committee more technical books tend to attract boys.  For example, guys can drone on for hours about football with endless statistics trotted off which shows they can demonstrate an enormous amount of knowledge storing.  Boys would more than likely prefer to read sports annuals, for example.  The balance of books in school libraries needs to be examined.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">It is more a question of fiction over fact.  Young men, whatever their interests, are more inclined to read books based on fact rather than fiction.  This is what is coming through on the specialist advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">On reform of the junior certificate, there has been a mistake in the way matters have come out and I must accept responsibility for that.  We are not saying that one can teach only eight subjects in the junior certificate curriculum.  A student can study a number of subjects, but will be examined in only eight.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I would like the marking system to revert to what it used to be, where there was honours, pass and fail and where there would not be the 5% gradations that exist in the leaving certificate, because it is not the same as the leaving certificate.
