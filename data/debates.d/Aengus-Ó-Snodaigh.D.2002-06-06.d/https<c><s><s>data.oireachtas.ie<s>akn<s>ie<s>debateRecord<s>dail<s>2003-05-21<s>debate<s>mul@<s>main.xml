          <p eId="para_1">On 4 June, at this very time, students will be one hour into the leaving certificate English examination. They will be marked for clarity and conciseness in their replies. Between now and then, uncertainty is hanging over those 50,000 students and their parents regarding a Government proposal to reintroduce third level fees. They do not know if they will have to pay fees to go to university.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">I ask the Taoiseach again today to remove the uncertainty that hangs over those students and their parents, in advance of the report from the Minister for Education and Science, by stating that third level fees will not be introduced in the forthcoming academic year, irrespective of the discussions at Cabinet or the contents of the Minister's report. I do not want the reply the Taoiseach gave yesterday but a straight answer. Will he state that the Government does not intend to introduce third level fees for the academic year starting this autumn?</p>

          <p eId="para_5">With equal clarity I remind the Taoiseach that the Tánaiste said this would have been better discussed internally before the public discussion. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, said he is completely opposed to this, as did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Government Chief Whip, herself an esteemed member of the teaching profession, said we need clarity on this now. With this proposal the Taoiseach has created uncertainty for thousands of students and their parents. The proposal is doomed to failure. Will he abandon ship, forget the proposal and tell the people his Government has no intention of introducing third level fees? The Tánaiste said the property tax of 1980 caused  more fear than the tax it collected and that we must not do that again. Will the Taoiseach show leadership of his Government and tell the nation that third level fees will not be reintroduced?</p>

          <p eId="para_6">At risk of repeating myself, as I have said on numerous occasions we spend €380 million on student supports at third level, which is a sizeable amount. The free third level fees scheme cost €240 million last year and will cost more this year. The Minister for Education and Science, as part of his expenditure review, is looking at how best to use his resources and at how best to improve access to third level education. He has been looking at a number of issues in an education review for the last few months and in the figures already available from that review, 97% of children from the higher managerial groups receive a third level education. The figure for the lower socio-economic group is 21%, while in many disadvantaged communities the figure is as low as 5%. The Minister has been looking at what he can do in the future to deal with access and his review is almost complete. In the normal course of events the Cabinet will make a decision and that will be conveyed to everyone. Hopefully, that will be done before the leaving certificate starts.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_13">According to reports the Government is contemplating the reintroduction of fees at a very high threshold. It is clear the amount of money saved is derisory, with the most recent figures from the Revenue Commissioners suggesting only 3% of income earners admit to an income of over €100,000. If the argument being made relates to equity, then why, during the five years of the boom, did the last Government not improve the Breaking the Cycle programme or the Early Start initiative? Why, in the immediate wake of the general election, did it restrict budgetary funding for the access programmes for school retention? Why was nothing done to improve the chances for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get into education? It is derisory to suggest that the purpose is to tackle inequity in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">My understanding is that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will put forward a loan scheme in his memorandum. This is a smokescreen. He will bring in a loan scheme which will have the sup port of the Progressive Democrats who have taken to absenting themselves from the House. That loan scheme will put people on moderate incomes in hock. There will be a brain drain as a result of it and what happened in Australia will happen here where young, skilled and educated people, which our economy needs, will emigrate. That is what is wrong with a loan scheme which is being contemplated by the Government, which has the support of the Progressive Democrats and which will save the Minister's neck. It is a disgrace because it will impose significant hardship on ordinary people.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I reiterate that no decision has been taken to reintroduce fees for third level education. A review on access is taking place to see what we can do to try to improve the opportunities for people in working class areas – people who have not had an opportunity to participate in third level education since the foundation of this State. As I said, participation by the upper echelons of society is 97%, while in the lower echelons of society, it is 5%. Over the last few years we have been endeavouring to try to change that. We have been working through first and second level education.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">Overall funding is up 94% in the last five years. We were spending €2.9 billion on education but we are now spending €5.6 billion. Many of these young people have now come through good first and second level education. They want an opportunity to get further education and it is right that we should look at these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">We have considerably increased the amount of money for the capital programme – by 50% for capitation funding and 94% for capitation funding for post-primary schools. Right across the board, this Government has put considerable resources into education. There is still a difficulty in one area, namely, access for people from lower groups to third level education. It is right, and it would be totally irresponsible of the Government, not to look at this issue to see whether it is possible to find an easy solution. The Australian example may not be right. I remind Deputy Rabbitte – obviously, he does not know – that Australia has the strongest economy in the world, growing at a considerably faster pace than those of Japan, the United States or elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">Its education system is considered to be good, as is ours. To try to use that argument does not hold up.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We have also moved from a position where there were only 40,000 people in third level education to a position where there are 120,000. For  the first time people who get the necessary points do not have to go to an English university. One of the dilemmas only a few years ago was that people did not have the opportunity to go to third level in this country. We have addressed that issue and it is now resolved. There is more than an adequate number of places in our third level colleges. We now have about 27 third level colleges of one form or another. There is one issue left at which to look. These are the facts. Whatever about the resolution, Government must look at this issue. Yesterday, I heard people say that only a few people earned over €100,000. At least Deputy Rabbitte has looked at that overnight. About 50,000 people earn over €100,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Does the Taoiseach not know that we have the second lowest spend in Europe, as a percentage of GDP, on education and that only Greece spends less? He said 50,000 people earn over €100,000. Indeed, 56,000 people admit to incomes of over €100,000 and not all of them, by any means, have students likely to go into or in third level education. In so far as we have figures, we have the Clancy report for 1992-98 which covers only two years of the free fees. It shows that for the lowest socio-economic categories, there was almost a doubling of participation rates from 12% to 22%. It will take a generation to know the impact of the removal of fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about timing. Why choose the time when 50,000 young people are about to sit their leaving certificate to create this anxiety and concern?</p>

          <p eId="para_37">As I stated at the outset, there has been no decision to reintroduce fees for third level education. What is awaited by people outside this House, who will take an interest in these matters, is a review to see if we can do anything to improve access for people who do not have opportunities. There are 19,000 additional students in full-time third level education while part-time enrolments are up 41%. Our young people are not emigrating. I do not know what period Deputy Rabbitte is talking about but I remember when over 50,000 people per year emigrated, when the advertisement was that we had the best and the brightest, although they were all on their way to the airport, and when people in third level education had no opportunities in this country. People are now working here – there are 600,000 more people at work – and people have an education.</p>

When last in Government, the parties opposite spent a lousy €0.5 million on disadvantaged education but we are now spending €26 million. We have put money into third level education. Those opposite should be honest, as we will be. Those opposite only care about the people who are wealthy and those who are already in third level education. If one is disadvantaged, living on the margins and on welfare, the Labour Party and Fine Gael do not care two hells about one. Those opposite should just be honest.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">Given that the reintroduction of third level fees is a non-starter, I will address a separate issue. Last week I welcomed the Taoiseach's statement that he is in favour of  the rights of representatives of people in the Six Counties to have access to this House to participate in debates concerning the Good Friday Agreement and other related issues. Does the Taoiseach share my concern that people in the Six Counties who aspire to national democracy rather than to the link with Westminster are now left with no parliamentary forum in which to be represented? They are doubly disenfranchised by the suspension of the Assembly and the cancellation of the elections which were to take place on 29 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Does the Taoiseach accept that there is no apparent disagreement among the parties in this House regarding this proposition? Given that there is unanimity that it should apply to all MPs north of the Border, the House must be put on notice that Sinn Féin will utilise its Private Members' Business time in the coming week to facilitate a debate on the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and related matters. In light of that, will the Taoiseach progress his commitment of last week and seek the agreement of all party leaders in this House to invite the presence of all the MPs elected in the Northern constituencies? There is no other step required. The matter is firmly in the Taoiseach's hands and he has the opportunity to proceed. I would like him to confirm that he will avail of this opportunity to move matters forward with the alacrity that the present political vacuum in the North requires and demands.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I replied to Deputy Ó Caoláin on this matter last week. The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution reported on it well over a year ago and all parties outlined their positions at that stage. There were some procedural issues to be resolved, as I understand from the report prepared at that stage by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. There was all-party agreement in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">The procedures have to be put in place – they are unlikely to be put in place by next week – and, as I indicated last week, I agree with them. If they can be put in place over the next period, we should be in a position by the next session to have the participation of people in debates on the Good Friday Agreement and other relevant issues in the House and committees, as per the agreement set out in the Lenihan report, as it became known. I have no difficulty with that. We had a debate to discuss the issues, but I have no difficulty with and welcome another next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">The Taoiseach's response indicates that there is a lesser likelihood of the accommodation of Northern representation here in the coming week. Will the Taoiseach re-examine that because all that is required is confirmation from the leaders of all the parties in the House and for him to instruct the House to make the necessary facilitation for the visiting Members of Parliament from the north of  Ireland. What is required, therefore, is the political will and determination to proceed without further delay. I do not believe that circumstances in the North, owing to the suspension of the Assembly and the cancellation of the elections, are helped by further delay in accommodating the representatives of the disparate opinion in the North. Will the Taoiseach undertake to contact the British Prime Minister to request and demand, on behalf of the people of this island, that the elections that have been cancelled be rescheduled for a date before the end of June 2003?</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I have already disagreed with and expressed my disappointment at the decision of the British Government to postpone the elections. To remind the Deputy, I do not have the power to instruct the House on the matter but can only make suggestions and proposals to it. In this case, an all-party committee, with which we have all agreed, has provided the blueprint according to which the House should proceed. There is political agreement on that already but to accommodate the Deputy's proposal, the House would have to make some quite significant changes in its normal procedures that have not been set out previously, although I agree with the House making these changes. However, I cannot change the position over night. In the Government's view and, I think, the view of everybody else in the House it was wrong to cancel the elections. I agree with the principle of representation for Northern parties in this House and in committees to debate the Good Friday Agreement and other issues, which is what the report is about.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_66">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 18, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Following from the completion of the ratification process for the new agreement, Sustaining Progress, the mechanisms for monitoring and overseeing its implementation are now being put in place. The mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of the agreement are provided for in the agreement itself and they are set out in paragraph 1.9, as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_68">a Steering Group for the Agreement representing Government and four representatives from each of the social partner pillars, will be established with overall responsibility for management of the implementation of the Agreement;</p>
          <p eId="para_69">the Steering Group will review, monitor and report on progress in the implementation-progression of the wider policy framework at the quarterly plenary meetings;</p>
          <p eId="para_70">social partners will be engaged by relevant Government Departments on specific policy proposals, on the basis of the agreed terms of engagement set out in the Agreement;</p>
          <p eId="para_71">any issues or difficulties in relation to engagement on issues covered by these chapters can be raised with the Steering Group. The Steering Group may make recommendations as appropriate to ensure the effective delivery of the spirit and intent of the Agreement; and</p>
          <p eId="para_72">the Steering Group will also identify, prioritise,timescale and agree those issues which require further study or examination within any of the relevant Institutional Arrangements identified in the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">As Deputies will be aware, my Department exercises the main co-ordinating role for the overall implementation of the Agreement in this respect. In this context, my Department has written to each of the social partner pillars inviting them to put forward their nominees for the steering group, as proposed under Sustaining Progress. The steering group, which is chaired by my Department, has overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the programme. I attended the inaugural meeting of the steering group on Monday, 12 May, where the  approach to its challenging work programme was discussed and agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Ongoing quarterly reviews are also provided for at the Sustaining Progress plenary meetings. The inaugural plenary meeting, which I will be attending with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance will take place in July. A particularly significant review will take place when the terms of the pay agreement fall due for consideration in 18 months. This will provide an opportunity to take stock of the environment and of progress achieved in relation to the overall goals of the agreement and to consider any opportunities arising to refocus and reprioritise action as improvements in the overall economic climate and the availability of resources might allow.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">In addition to the annual plenary meeting, I also meet representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis. In this context, I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at their request, together with my colleague the Minister for Transport, on Thursday last to hear at first hand their concerns regarding the development of transport policy. The meeting provided an opportunity for a full and frank exchange of views and the discussions will be continued at official level.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">The pay agreement that forms part of Sustaining Progress provides for the continuation, with an enhanced role, of the National Implementation Body, which was established under the PPF to ensure the delivery of the industrial relations stability and peace provisions of the new agreement. The body, which is chaired by my Department and represents Government, IBEC, CIF and ICTU, meets as necessary to review ongoing disputes of major national importance. Meetings of the body also provide an opportunity for informal discussions of the broader issues around the social partnership process for the employer and trade union representatives. The NIB has met on a number of occasions recently in the context of industrial action being taken in a number of areas of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Liaison officers have also been nominated by all relevant Departments and they will have particular responsibility for supporting the implementation of the terms of Sustaining Progress, and implementing the consultation arrangements appropriate to their Departments. In the case of the community and voluntary pillar of social partnership, the member organisations are those that have endorsed Sustaining Progress. The membership of this pillar has changed as a result of members' views of participation in social partnership under the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government and the decision of two organisations not to accept Sustaining Progress. The community and voluntary pillar now has 15 member organisations which have endorsed Sustaining Progress, part 6, on an individual basis, and nine organisations representing the areas of older people, disability, housing, children, rural,  local, voluntary and care. My Department met the pillar to explain the arrangement to support the Sustaining Progress agreement and the social partnership process more generally. This gave me an opportunity to meet the new member organisations of the pillar. The organisations which did not endorse Sustaining Progress are not members of the community and voluntary pillar and will not participate with social partners in the various mechanisms set out in the agreement. However, they will have the opportunity to contribute to policy development as part of the consultation process with the voluntary sector, as is the norm in areas of concern to them. Their views will be taken into account in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Finally, in response to Deputy Joe Higgins's question about the National Social and Economic Council, the council has completed its term of office and a new council will be appointed soon. The previous council agreed to undertake a study of housing policy and the secretariat is progressing this pending the appointment of a new council for which nominees have been sought from the social partners.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">Is the Taoiseach not concerned that Government actions are responsible for at least half of the serious increase in inflation? Is he not concerned that under the benchmarking agreement this money is channelled into public service pay resulting in the withdrawal of public services in hospitals, the non-implementation of schools programmes, and a complete slow down in the provision of public services? Does that not cast serious doubt upon the State's ability to deliver in respect of the promises and commitments which this Government has given?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_43">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_80">The benchmarking process which followed from the PPF ensured that there would be no special increases in that period and that an independent review would examine public service pay against equivalent sectors outside the public service. That process went on for almost two years and was reported on. The matter was discussed and came into the partnership talks. Deputy Kenny suggests that we should not have used our resources to pay the individuals concerned in this costly process. However, this was an accumulation of a three year period during which they did not receive special payments as would have happened under the old arrangement. The categories were independently verified. Benchmarking is not linked to pay alone, it is linked to the verification process which is operating, as agreed, a new stringent mechanism whereby change, in some cases substantive, is provided for across a range of areas that have been identified. Part of that mechanism operated in the PPF but this is a far more rigorous assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">On the inflation issues, some Government decisions led to a part – not half or anything close to that – of the inflation mechanisms.  Under the social partnership process, and generally, the Government is engaged in a campaign to deal with inflationary pressures as far as possible across all areas and, hopefully, it will be successful. The first two meetings of the group on inflation focused on the factors underlining inflation and existing programmes and policies designed to reduce it. The group has also held meetings with representatives of the CSO, the Competition Authority and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The group will be developing proposals to bring to Government to provide for sustaining progress and inflationary measures. Apart from those suggestions, the Government is involved in an anti-inflationary package.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_44">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_82">The CSO figures indicate that indirect taxes contributed directly to 1.4% of an increase in inflation and other charges levied by the Government brought about an increase of 0.8% in inflation, which is over 2.3%, approximately, of an increase directly attributable to a Government action. I did not say that payments should not be made. Is it not a fact that we do not know the basis upon which benchmarking was introduced? We do not know what the evidence was. How can the Taoiseach monitor changes if we do not have confirmation of what was to be changed? Is it not a fact that having had these discussions and introduced benchmarking, money is now being sucked into the public pay domain to the detriment of the delivery of effective public services, frustrating members of the public when services they should receive are not being delivered?</p>
          <p eId="para_83">In respect of the national implementation body, could the Taoiseach give an update on the introductory meeting in respect of the settlement of the public health doctors dispute, now in its fifth week?

          <p eId="para_101">There is no point in my saying it is and the Deputy saying it is not. The reality is that most of that information is in the public domain. The benchmarking report was published. It was debated last year at every congress in the country. Every union group outlined its submissions in the public domain. The analyses were published in every newspaper. The matter has been a source of debate and discussion all over the country. To say that nobody knows what the body benchmarked against is simply untrue. Regarding the verification process, the performance verification groups will differ in several ways. Deputy Kenny made a point about the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and the groups will be far stronger than they were under that. It was necessary that they had what were dubbed "policy assurance groups". They will contain more independent representatives and monitor the implications of modernisation initiatives more closely and robustly. The chairs of the  groups of the sectors and the representatives of the management and unions will meet to ensure a consistent approach across all sectors. Adherence to agreed procedures and industrial peace is required, and that is set out in the performance verification groups. Members do not need me to go through it all again, for it is in the public domain, but I can do so if people wish me to.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">On the disputes mechanisms, the national implementation group has examined the public doctors' dispute and made its views public. It asked the public doctors to go to the Labour Relations Commission. I understand the final session regarding that dispute is to take place at the Labour Relations Commission tomorrow. It is true to say that they have not had much progress or success in it. I do not want to pre-empt tomorrow's discussions, but discussions have not gone particularly well to date. One hopes that tomorrow might be better. The other dispute has been a subject for the Minister for Agriculture and Food. The national implementation body has not been involved in it.</p>

The report has been made public, but the basis of some of the calculations – the comparitors and all the rest – has not been put into the public domain, and the surviving members of the benchmarking body made the point on the day of publication that they would not make it available. Was the Government or the Department of the Taoiseach consulted about that, and did they agree with the decision?</p>

          <p eId="para_104">The Deputy is right that the benchmarking group, in its final report, said that it would not include all the assessments, calculations and work that it had carried out. However, it put a very substantial part of the basis for its work, report and thinking into the public domain. The cases that were put forward and the analogues and comparisons that were being used are fairly clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">If I recall correctly – and I am relying on memory here – only two relatively small issues were disputed regarding individual grades which had difficulties with the comparative analysis. All the other data were resolved satisfactorily between negotiators from the report published. It was not a source of dispute except for those two areas, where the benchmarking body had said that it would not put its working papers in the public domain. However, it published a considerable amount. I cannot recall the two grades, but I remember that there were disputes on two specific issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The body dealt with the issues comprehensively. From the report and the cases put forward, it is not difficult, except in those two cases, to understand the logic it followed. I do not feel there were any outstanding difficulties.</p>

Does the Taoiseach think it is satisfactory that there is no body of work that people concerned with these matters can analyse to their own satisfaction? Were he, his Department or any of his Ministers advised in advance that it was the benchmarking body's intention to immolate itself immediately after the report's publication?</p>

It put in an extraordinary amount of effort and time and did a good job. It felt that it should not publish all its calculations, background work and papers. It had shown the comparitor grades, the analogue cases and the basis of its work and felt that it had done enough. In reply to Deputy Rabbitte's second question, I have been through the six months of discussions on the pay talks, and there was no objection from any of the bodies about their not having got satisfactory information, except a reference to two grades that came out at the start. There was no demand for the benchmarking body to give out any other additional information. All I can tell the Deputy is that it was not an issue.</p>

I know that he is right to say that the benchmarking body felt that it should not make the data available. However, I am asking the Taoiseach what he thinks, not what the benchmarking body thought. Is he satisfied that those data should not be available, and did he, his Department or his Government have any advance notice that it was the intention of the persons sitting on the benchmarking body not to make that information available? The time will come when academics and others will go back over this issue and examine it.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that over the period of social partnerships, profits have increased much more rapidly than wages? Internationally, Ireland experienced the largest growth in profits since 1987 among all of the European member states, and greater than Japan and United States. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that during the 1990s, output per head almost doubled while, between 1985 and 1999, unit labour costs fell by about 20%?</p>
          <p eId="para_132">In that context, does the Taoiseach recognise that the percentage wage increases in Sustaining Progress cannot and will not keep pace with inflation? Does he recognise that the increases already provided for are being wiped out by inflation created as a direct result of the Government's policies regarding VAT increases, the increased cost of medicines, outrageous insurance costs, transport costs and spiralling rents and mortgages which are leaving workers and their families unable to meet the costs of day to day life?</p>

          <p eId="para_133">No, I do not agree. We have just been talking about increases under benchmarking which are far in excess of inflation. The estimated cost of implementing benchmarking increases is somewhere in the order of €565 million for the first year and €825 million for next year. The percentages are quite substantial as there is about €1.5 billion tied up in regard to the public service alone. The rate of increase across all sectors is such that if inflation had not been so high, the House would not have agreed to these increases, which relates to the point made by Deputy Kenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Benchmarking is a separate issue in the context of some people having fallen behind over several years. If anything, we are trying to maintain our competitive position. There are no circumstances in which pay rates could be higher as that would be extremely damaging to the economy, and I hope we will reach a position where they will be lower. Otherwise, competitiveness will be lost, which causes the loss of jobs and activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">As we know, profits will be down this year because economic growth is down in Ireland as it is in every country. The type of wealth generating activity of recent years is no longer evident. I  reiterate that the Government, with the social partners, will do all it can in a number of ways to drive down inflationary pressures in the economy, including in the professional and retail sectors and any other area where it is possible.</p>

Does he agree that this cost was not factored in, whatever he knows about the mechanisms which went into arriving at benchmarking? Accordingly, does the Taoiseach agree that it is time to look again at the make-up of the membership of social partnership, and that the social, environmental and sustainability expert bodies would be considered part of it rather than hiving them off under the title of Comhar, which is not involved at the talks? Will the Taoiseach seriously take this on board, given the enormity of the financial burden on the horizon and considering the record of the country overall and the Government in particular?</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Given that food prices in Ireland are considered to be higher than anywhere else in the EU, will the Government accept responsibility for taking action on that issue? Farmers are getting less and less for their produce while consumers are being asked to pay more. Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government has some responsibility in this regard? A Cheann Comhairle, you sent a Parliamentary Question back to me stating that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no responsibility for the price of food.

          <p eId="para_144">That might be a little unfair. On inflation, I have seen the reports and, even though it is not agreed by the retail bodies, producers or employers that Ireland is the most expensive country, with the Competition Authority, the CSO and the social partners working together to analyse and make decisions, we can implement measures to try to force prices down. While there are issues on which different sectors do not agree, they are all committed to do what they can to drive down prices. Comparative analysis has been carried out, which is why the CSO is on the working group on prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">The Government is committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable  housing. A number of initiatives have been outlined, including Part V of the Planning and Development Act, an agreement that we will work with the parties to ensure the maximisation of the output from the affordable housing schemes and consideration of issues regarding the CPO rules, how the arbitration process works, the Kenny report, rezoning and the use of State lands. That is on the social side but there is a knock-on effect both under local authority schemes and the Part V changes for this year which will help in terms of social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">My view is that it will take a number of years to work up the affordable housing element of it. There will have to be intervention in a number of ways; it will not happen easily. It will take some time to pull through a number of the issues listed in Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">On the simplification of the CPO rule regarding rezoning issues and some of the issues surrounding land on the State register, a number of those issues will need to work before we will get more affordable housing. By affordable housing I mean housing we can try to target towards young people, and those not so young, who are trying to get on to the first step of the housing ladder. The real benefit for them is to deal with the land issue. Not much can be done in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Many examinations are ongoing but my own view is that the only way to get this done is by trying to provide land at a cheaper price to the construction industry to allow people buy houses at a lower price that reflects the value of the land. Many studies have been done in that regard and it will mean the State having to help, directly or indirectly, in the supply of that land. It will not happen any other way. It will not be easy to do but people working together can find ways of doing it. It will not affect the upper end of the market but it can dramatically affect the lower end of the market for people who are trying to come into the housing net for the first time.</p>

What transpired from the Taoiseach's discussions with Mr. Begg on the health services? Did the Taoiseach know at the time there would be job implications like the 161 jobs that will go at the Mater? Was that issue discussed with Mr. David Begg?</p>
          <p eId="para_162">In terms of the discussions with congress about the 10,000 houses to which Deputy Allen referred, is there is any clarity in terms of the provision of those houses? What did the Minister of  State, Deputy Noel Ahern, mean when he said that we would be selling off State property to private developers? If we have State property to sell off, why do we not give it to local authorities? Why are we selling it off to private developers? What is the thinking behind that?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">My meeting with David Begg was to do with transport-related issues. Congress and the affiliate unions had asked for a meeting on transport issues so we discussed transport-related areas. That is not to say we will not have meetings about other issues but the one I mentioned last week was on transport issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">On the question of affordable housing, as I just said in reply to Deputy Allen, we are talking about affordable housing as distinct from social housing. The affordable housing initiative in Sustaining Progress is geared at individuals who would, in the normal course of events, purchase their own houses but who are having difficulty because of the price of houses. They are not like those on the social housing waiting list who it is hoped will benefit from the successful initiatives under the 1999 local authority scheme. All planning permissions now have to comply with Part V but that is in respect of social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">One of the issues being examined as regards affordable housing is making available or selling the State landbank to developers at more attractive rates so that we could have control over the price of land for each unit of housing which would reduce the overall pricing. That is what they are examining. That would be done in an effort to take some of the State landbank, land that would be held—</p>

If it was a joint venture under Part V, with some lands for local authority housing and some for affordable housing, it also could be sold. However, in particular they were looking at trying to drive down prices for people who want to buy their own house, which is classified as affordable, and to try to influence the market for first-time buyers. That is the initiative they are examining. The register of all State lands has just been completed by the Office of Public Works through the  Department of Finance. That is what the Minister of State was referring to – rather than each Department and agency selling off land.</p>

Is he also aware that one in three PAYE workers are paying tax at the higher rate of tax and yet 25% of the highest earners pay no tax at all? The pattern appears to be that the Taoiseach does not agree with me on these questions but I will ask it once again. Will he agree that this new pay agreement can only fail in the absence of a fair and equitable tax system?</p>

The approach taken by the employers has created a lot of bad faith. Will the Taoiseach agree it is vital to provide the reforms in the Department of Health and Children, and in other Departments also, if partnership agreements are to be sustained into the future? What kind of reforms does the Taoiseach intend to institute in the Department of Health and Children?</p>

I am aware that there are disputes concerning issues which go back to 1994. A review which was supposed to take two years was not completed until 1999. I know there is ill feeling on both sides about that issue. On the other hand, I do not wish to say anything which would make matters worse. I told the management side several weeks ago, a message I repeated at a meeting earlier today, that it should try to address the various anomalies, particularly the out-of-hours issue which is a major point of contention in this dispute, and make reasonable offers. Without wishing to be difficult, I repeat that substantial sums of money are involved in the dispute. The current offer would mean raising salaries from €82,000 to €111,000, with increases ranging from €11,000 to €29,000, which are substantial sums of money. While I am not trying to simplify the matter, a substantial offer is on the table.</p>

It was meant to take two years and I am not in any way condoning the fact that, instead of being completed in 1996, it was not completed until 1999. The reason lay on the management side. I do not think there were difficulties at political level during that period. However, both sides are involved. I would not have a difficulty if, as part of the package, they also tried to deal with reform issues. They are important people and I hope they will be able to make some progress tomorrow.</p>

Deputy Paul McGrath recently received information under the Act which exposed deception within the Department of Education and Science in the way the schools building programme was being implemented. To be consistent with our opposition to any changes in the Freedom of  Information Act and in the public interest, I must oppose the proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">I am bound to agree with Deputy Kenny as we currently have before us a glaring example of the reason the Government wants to ringfence its decision-making process. The public should be able to see the papers prepared for the introduction of a loans scheme for access to third level education, which will cause intolerable hardship for many ordinary working families who will take up the option of approaching their bank, building society or credit union to raise money to put their children through third level education. We will not be able to see the relevant documents now because the 30 year rule will apply or the information will be stamped "ongoing" by the Secretaries General of the relevant Departments. This is a backward step for the reason given by Deputy Kenny, namely, the Progressive Democrats Party colluded with the Fianna Fáil Party in shutting out reasonable access to information. It is a disgrace and to be consistent we must continue to oppose it.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Only a couple of minutes ago we encountered difficulties while trying to get behind the mechanisms for making decisions on the benchmarking report. It is important, when we consider No. 12, that we take into account the probability that information will not be available and what this can mean. For example, it recently emerged that some of the funds generated by the plastic bag levy go towards incineration. That information came out as a result of a request under the Freedom of Information Act. It highlights a perverse notion of incineration as a type of recycling. We should revisit that issue again. It is not satisfactory to take the motion without debate because there is an agenda within the Government to try to present a spin which hides some of the more mistaken decisions which have already been made and which will continue to be made unless freedom of information is available.</p>

While ordinarily I would not object to the content of what is proposed, I join with the other Opposition parties in reaffirming our deep felt concern at the Government's continued tinkering with freedom of information. That principle has long been affirmed in the House and we should ensure that continues not only on the basis of the substantive Act as introduced, but that it grows and flourishes.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently announced the establishment of a reserve Garda force. Last week the Minister for Defence was unable to say whether that would require legislation. Yesterday the Taoiseach was unclear as to whether secondary legislation might be required. Has he spoken to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about this matter? Will secondary legislation be necessary? Will the roles and responsibilities of persons who serve in this force be defined? Will the force be put in place this year? Will it be necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure these people do their jobs?</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Regarding amendment No. 1, section 25 of the Bill replaces section 5 of the Fire Services Act 1981 with a new section 5 that updates the penalty provisions of the Fire Services Act and brings them into line with current practice. It also gets rid of the complicated procedures for dealing with offences set out in the old section  5(3) of the Fire Services Act. This procedure involved the DPP and the defendant's right to trial by jury in the criminal procedure legislation of 1967. This was a very cumbersome, complex and lengthy process which hindered the effective enforcement of the new penalty provisions of the Act. In short the local authority could not take enforcement proceedings in serious offences under the Fire Safety Act. They went to the DPP and there were delays in enforcement. This is much too serious to allow lengthy delays. Section 30 amends section 20 of the 1981 Act to insert a new section 20A.</p>

This is to ensure that the penalty section of the Fire Services Act is amended so that it can be prosecuted as a summary or as an indictable offence. It came from the professional advisers in the Department. It will allow us to update the fines to €3,000 and €120,000 for the summary and the indictable offence.

Very few of the cases passed to the DPP see the light of day because of the lengthy process of dotting every "i" and crossing every "t". Based on advice, this amendment simply includes the new closure order as both a summary and indictable offence. It is no more or less than that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_393">Sometimes when amendments come back to the Dáil from the Seanad they relate to fairly minor technical matters which could not have been foreseen or arise from some substantial issue that arises from the debate in the Seanad itself. The Minister is proposing quite a significant change in the law. If this arose from the professional advice available to the Minister, I am surprised this was not flagged at an earlier stage. It comes before us quite late in the day and it is incumbent on us to understand the exact import of this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Do I understand the Minister to say that a local authority – in effect the chief fire officer of such a local authority – can now take a prosecution in the Circuit Court under the Fire Services Act for an indictable offence without recourse to the  DPP? Will such cases be tried without a jury? What offences are embraced by the proposed change? Is it just the offences that were traditionally covered by the Fire Services Act or is it intended that the new offences, provided for in the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill will also be covered? For example in the case of a person operating an indoor event without a licence on whom the local authority serves a closure notice which is not complied with, it is now intended that the local authority can prosecute that without reference to the DPP.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">On earlier Stages, I raised concern about how the indoor licensing legislation might be used. A large public meeting might be organised, perhaps at short notice and perhaps on an issue where communities are in conflict with a local authority on an issue relating, for example, to service charges or a major planning issue and the numbers attending the meeting might exceed the threshold allowed for in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Is the Minister of State telling the House that in the case of a meeting to protest at something the local authority has done, the local authority can, without recourse to the DPP, serve a closure notice and prosecute the organisers of the event leading, perhaps, to prison sentences or sizeable fines? Similarly – I instanced this at earlier stages in the debate – if a university students union, for example, organises a lunchtime concert and does not apply for a licence a closure notice could be served on the students and the same thing could happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">It is important that we understand that this is not a minor matter. It is about local authorities being given the power to prosecute. We all think that what is envisaged here is the prosecution of a rogue operator of a premises who piles large numbers of people into a premises which does not have fire escapes and in which exit doors are locked and so on. None of us has any disagreement with such a person being pursued in court as expeditiously as possible. Unfortunately, this legislation has a wider remit than that and the House should understand clearly exactly what the Minister of State is proposing, particularly as it has arisen at a very late stage.

          <p eId="para_398">My professional advice is that the closure notice should be incorporated into the section, with a view to ensuring that cases could be brought before the courts and dealt with more speedily. The amendment simply includes the closure notice in the penalties section of the Fire Services Act. We are dealing now with Part 3 of this Bill, which does not deal with indoor events but with the fire services legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Many of the questions raised by Deputy Gilmore are those I raised myself at the time and I was convinced that this is in the best interest of public safety. We are unanimous regarding the importance of public safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I hope there is no ambiguity. This measure relates to Part 3 of the Act and the Fire Services Act. Anyone who seeks to justify the existence of the Seanad might remember that this matter was raised in that House, not by Opposition Members but by the Government. This gave the Government an opportunity to improve the Bill. Had this gone through we might not have had the opportunity to deal with the matter for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Minor offences will always be dealt with in the District Court and serious offences in the Circuit Court before a jury. There is nothing new here. It is exactly the same as if the measure had been passed in the Dáil. The closure notice was simply included at that stage as a summary offence and we now want to ensure that it can be an indictable offence as well.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_402">One thing has changed since the last time we discussed this Bill. Grumbles of discontent have been heard from the promoters and operators of events. I sense that this will continue and intensify. One very salient point has been made. The passing of this Bill may well see a significant increase in ticket prices for indoor events. I am concerned that there may be a €10 or €20 increase in ticket prices to comply with the red tape and bureaucracy which this legislation is foisting on us. Of course there is a need to provide greater fire safety and protection for citizens but that does not mean we have to place a restrictive layer of bureaucracy on to existing legislation. We are much better off licensing buildings in which events take place than imposing significant bureaucracy every time an event is held. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, that this could represent an insurmountable obstacle to holding events, whether by a student body, a religious body or any body in civil society that wishes to host an event.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Why is the Minister not coming at this from a building point of view rather than from an event point of view? That is how things work in other countries and I believe they work better. That would ensure that we do not have more red tape and an increase in ticket prices. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this?</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_404">Deputy Cuffe refers to the possibility of prohibitive costs, and so be it, but public safety comes first. I am not particularly interested in the additional cost because safety is of paramount importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">It will not be necessary to have an application for each individual event. There can be a multiple application and there need only be an additional €500 for a single event. There is no question of even considering that. The event will be licensed and not the building. That is the right way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I hope promoters will incorporate the additional cost of the licence into their profits rather than pass it on. Whoever pays, it is a small price to pay for public safety.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">With respect, a Chathaorligh, pigs might fly. To envisage a promoter not passing this cost on to the consumer is expecting too much of a promoter. Is this best practice abroad? Can the Minister of State say this is exactly the path that other countries are going down in ensuring fire safety? I am not convinced it is, from my limited knowledge of how things operate outside this country. I may be speaking with the professional bias of an architect and a town planner but I believe a building is either safe or it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">To look at every event on a one-off basis will place a stranglehold on every group in civil society which wishes to hold an event or a concert or have an impromptu celebration. We are renowned, as a nation, for being able to host an impromptu event at short notice, whether to welcome Seán Kelly back to Dublin after winning a sports event or to express concern at a new imposition at local level. We tend to host events on a very quick basis within a matter of days and that will be prohibited by this legislation. It is more akin to public order legislation than fire or public safety legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">We all agree with the Minister of State that safety is the main concern. However, could there be a conflict of interest in the local authority being the body granting licences? Some events which would require a licence might be contrary to the wishes of the local authority, such as a public meeting on incineration. People at such a meeting could be very upset with the county manager adopting a waste plan after getting the authority to do so from the Minister, for example. The local authority might not want any fuss or bother about such a plan so one could have a conflict there. The authority might not want a very contentious meeting to  take place; it would not be a fire safety issue but a meeting to prevent an incinerator being built, pardon the pun. There would be a conflict between the local authority and the organisers of an event, therefore the local authority, through the fire officer or someone else, might not be the proper authority to decide on allowing such an event to take place on the grounds of public safety.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">We are not dealing with indoor events but Part 3, which relates to the amendment. The licensing system only applies to large scale events with 1,000 people or more attending – the number is lower for children. We are implementing the Hamilton report and best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">There has been no problem with the outdoor licensing system. People will be able to attend events which will be well managed from the crowd control and safety point of view. Regarding the local authority having a vested interest, there is a structure in place allowing one to appeal a decision to the District Court within weeks. As a result of an amendment we accepted from Deputy Gilmore we changed the timescale by one week. This applies to crowds of 1,000 people and unless the crowd is bigger than that there is no need to apply for a licence. I cannot see the local authority acting on foot of vested interests. It is unlikely that over 1,000 people will want to attend an indoor event to protest or express their views about incineration but they may appeal the authority's decision to the courts in any case. I do not believe, however, a local authority would put vested interests before the common good.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">I will stick to the Bill. I am concerned that the amendments were introduced without any explanation whatsoever of what went on in the Seanad. I did not know why the Minister moved the amendment in the Seanad – whether it was an amendment from a Senator or the Department itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">This Bill has had the longest incubation period I have experienced, going back to the tragic events of 1996 which led to the decision to set up a working group to examine safety at indoor events. We all accepted the contents of the reports in principle and the Bill is based on those reports. We had long and exhaustive sessions in the House and some of us sat through every line of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I am also worried about the vested interests of the local authority but, on balance, I accept the arguments of the Minister of State. I reject out of hand any assertion that there should be blanket rules for venues rather than events. There is a hell of a difference between a sit-down musical like "<i>Les Misérables</i>” in The Point and a rave concert at the same venue. There must be differ ent rules for different events. We cannot have blanket rules, as that would be a fatal flaw, and thankfully we have not allowed that to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the point I made earlier, that the changes he is introducing today apply only to the original Fire Services Act rather than the new provisions of the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Minister of State referred earlier to the co-operation he received from the larger Opposition parties regarding the legislation. I remind him that the issues we are discussing were the subject of amendments tabled by Deputy Allen and me on Committee and Report Stages. My amendments attempted to address the issues of whether we should be licensing events or venues. I felt we should licence venues rather than events, albeit with different categories of events being provided for. I made the point then and reiterate now that there is a very serious danger that the legislation will licence out of existence the organisation of entertainment and social events generally. We already have a problem in that voluntary local events are no longer being organised because of insurance problems and fewer will be organised because of the requirement to get a licence for each event months in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">That will contribute to the growing consolidation of general entertainment events being centred on public houses and places where alcohol is available. If one raises the threshold for the organisation of events outside that area one will send more and more of it into the pubs. It is very difficult to find an indoor entertainment of any kind which is not associated with a pub.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">It will also make entertainment increasingly a domain of commercial activity. Fears have been raised that ticket prices and access to entertain ment generally will be more restricted and based on price, and those fears will become a reality. We are all for safety, an issue I addressed on Second Stage, but parts of the Bill are cases of regulation running wild with itself. The net effect will be to reduce the range of options for indoor entertainment and activities which are likely to be organised in the future. I am satisfied with the response of the Minister of State to the specific amendments before us.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_430">I appreciate the interest Deputy Gilmore has taken in this Bill. We are talking about a threshold and there is no need to apply for a licence unless it is for more than 1,000 adults. The threshold will be set out by way of regulation and, at the request of Deputies on Committee Stage, I indicated what the regulations would specify, which is, 750 adults. We covered the occasional meeting which might take place in the various universities and we overcame that issue. Some 1,000 adults is the figure. In the cases of pubs, I do not know too many which would accommodate 1,000 or 750 adults. The Deputy would have had reason to criticise me at a later stage had I not introduced this amendment to include this as an indictable offence. Amendments Nos. 2 to 14, inclusive, are related and all apply to section 30 regarding the closure notice to be inserted in the Fire Services Act 1981. The amendments have been recommended by the Parliamentary Counsel and have been accepted by the Seanad. They are mainly textual or technical amendments to improve the text of and to provide for greater clarity in the provisions of the Bill. The amendments remove commas or insert the word "sought" after the word "obtained". They are fairly minor, technical amendments but are important to the text of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Amendment No. 5 removes an inaccurate reference to the prescribed manner as it is considered that this may lead to confusion as nothing is prescribed nor is proposed to be prescribed in relation to this matter. Amendment No. 7 is required to deal with an issue of duplication. Subsection (7) is being repeated in section 11. The amendments are to improve the text of the Bill.</p>

It concerns a matter arising out of Committee Stage. As I understood, there was agreement on all sides to try to find a remedy to the question of a pardon. This matter relates to section 5. I would have tabled an amendment if I had known that the Minister was not going to come back with an amendment of his own. The amendments which have been tabled are short, technical amendments and there is no reference to this matter. It has left us in an unsatisfactory position. I thought there would have been a development on this issue. There is precedent for pardons to be granted, that is, in the context of the legislation arising out of the "Tallaght two" case – the 1993 Act. I would have thought the Minister would have come up with something along those lines but, unfortunately, he has not. I find the situation unsatisfactory and it makes it difficult to proceed with legislation without this matter being addressed in a formal fashion. Perhaps the Minister might comment on that.</p>

It is an Executive matter under the Constitution and is not something which should be legislated for in this way. It is doubtful whether it would be advisable or desirable that an attempt should be made by legislation to coerce the President or the Government to give the President advice to exercise the power of pardon in any particular circumstance.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">The 1993 Criminal Procedure Act specifically makes provision for the power of pardon to be exercised by the Minister for Justice. As I understand, it was brought in on foot of the Tallaght case where there was a perceived miscarriage of justice. Sections 2 to 6 allow the application of the courts, while sections 7 and 8 offer an alternative mechanism to apply to the Minister for Justice with a view to pardon. He may pro ceed through a committee or some other mechanism and may grant a pardon in these circumstances. Precedent has already been established and the Minister would not be creating precedent if he went along with what was all-party agreement, as I understood it, on Committee Stage. Both the Government parties and the Opposition felt that something should be included in the legislation which would seek to resolve the difficulty we are encountering.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">Perhaps I could help to clarify the matter by reading Article 15 of the Constitution. It states</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the President, but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I understand that the only circumstance in which a law can confer the prerogative of mercy on anybody else is in respect of commutation and remission. The right of pardon is vested exclusively in the President, who, under the Constitution, operates exclusively on the advice of the Government. I do not understand from my knowledge of the law – and nobody has suggested otherwise to me – that it is possible for me to create a statutory right of pardon or that it is possible to direct by legislation how the Government should or should not exercise that power.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">Amendment No. 1 deals with certain technical aspects that would have to be considered if the Bill were to be recast along the lines which Deputy Costello and I proposed on Committee Stage. I know certain groupings of amendments have been suggested, but amendment No. 1 changes the definition section. This would be  changed if the alternative approach proposed by the Opposition were accepted by the Minister. This leads us to question whether we should consider the core of the Bill at this stage or merely mention it. Can I deal with the core point?</p>

This would affect the entire Bill. We want the Bill to be recast. There are 61 amendments tabled, many of which are related to the desire of the Opposition to have direct incorporation of the convention into domestic law, as opposed to the indirect approach adopted by the Minister.

          <p eId="para_473">Amendment No. 1 indicates that the interpretation section would need to be changed if the fundamentally different approach I advocate is adopted, which is dealt with in more of the 61 amendments before the House. I do not intend to trouble the House unduly once we clarify the central issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It is ironic that it has taken us 50 years to deal with the question of incorporation. Most of those interested in the human rights area are very happy that it is being dealt with at this stage. There is not a universal welcome for the approach we advocate but there is an almost universal criticism of the manner in which the convention is being incorporated. Effectively, we are not incorporating the convention directly into domestic law, as many of us would wish. If it were to happen, we would have to make the necessary amendments, including amendment No. 1. The perfectionists would prefer the convention to have been adopted as part of our Constitution. This is dealt with at length in the report of the constitutional review group, which outlines an approach with which I agree. However, it is not the approach that has been adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">If we are not to amend the Constitution, most people will want to see the convention adopted directly as part of our legislation. That is the view of almost all involved in this area, except for Deputy McDowell, both in his former role as Attorney General and now as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. His approach is essentially that outlined in the Bill, given that the amendments are not accepted. It is regarded as a minimalist approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The amendments I and others have tabled, including amendment No. 1, provide an alternative menu for the Minister. I have no real expectation that he will dine off that menu but it is my role and function to provide it. It is also important to point out that the approach I propose is largely that of the Law Reform Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Law Society, the Bar Council, the National Union of Journalists and many NGOs which have made submissions in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I do not intend to rehearse their arguments except to focus on a central point. Having been through four days on Committee Stage debate I object to the lack of effective remedy arising from the way in which the Minister has drafted the Bill, which will be the law of the land if the amendments we have tabled are not adopted. The Bill as framed does not provide an effective remedy for somebody whose rights under the convention are infringed. Article 13 of the convention pro vides that there has to be a right to an effective remedy: "Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity."  There is no effective direct remedy from the courts, no provision for an order for release or an injunction and there is no provision for the courts to allow damages. I know how warmly the Minister feels towards the constitution, and it is a warmth I share.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I support the Constitution but it is a basic principle of Irish constitutional law that where there is a right there should be a remedy. This is the core issue: <i>ubi jus ibi remedium.</i> That was the old rule of law and we are not following it in this legislation. The Minister can, and will no doubt, point out that the Bill provides for an application to be made to the Attorney General for the Government to make an <i>ex gratia </i>payment. With respect, that is not a right. We are taking from the courts the right to provide a remedy and we are providing instead for a Government where “in their discretion, they consider that it may be appropriate, to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of compensation.”  This is my core objection to the manner in which this Bill has been framed. It should be recast and the amendments we have put down should be accepted. Amendment No. 1 would involve a change in interpretation of provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Why is the Bill before us now? The convention dates back to 1953. Fifty years later we are dealing with this Bill probably because of the Good Friday Agreement. I accept that we have fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Constitution and interpreted by the courts. Possibly because we have had such a strong constitutional position in relation to fundamental rights it has not been relevant to incorporate the convention into domestic law. However, we provided in the Good Friday Agreement that the Irish Government was to take steps to "further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction", that it must take into account the work of the Oireachtas All-party Committee on the Constitution and the report of the constitutional review group and must bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Today we are carrying out an act of completion, to meet an obligation under the Good Friday Agreement, but in the context of the points that I have outlined we are not doing it as effectively as we should. This is also relevant in that under the Good Friday Agreement there is a proposal for an all-Ireland charter of rights and we will have to consider what that will include. From that point of view the European convention will play an important role as something that can be shared by both parts of the island. That is the relevance of our incorporating the convention in an effective way into this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">We are saying that direct incorporation is the way to do it rather than producing an Act "to enable further effect to be given" which is what this Bill is doing. We are not directly incorporating the convention, we are merely providing that in interpreting and applying any statutory provision or rule of law a court shall, in so far as is possible, subject to the rules of law relating to such interpretation or application do so in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention provisions. The central amendment is that the convention provisions should have the force of law in the State so that everyone within this jurisdiction would enjoy the rights and freedoms specified therein. That is the core issue as between the Government and Opposition and it is on that basis that the interpretation provisions highlighted in amendment No. 1 need to be amended. That is why we need to deal with it at this stage. On that basis I make a final effort to urge the Minister on the road to Damascus to consider direct incorporation.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">He, virtually alone, is in favour of the indirect approach outlined in the Bill. He went to great lengths to discuss it with many people and many groups but he has failed to convince anybody, including the Opposition, of the merits of his approach. He is the Minister and he clearly has his mind set on this approach but I would be neglecting my duty to all those others who have urged a different approach if I did not make one last effort to try to convince him that the direct incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law is the right and proper approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_484">It is not often that I agree wholeheartedly with a colleague in Fine Gael but in this instance my party does so. The best way of dealing with the convention is to adopt it directly as part of our domestic law. What we see is a very watery approach to what is a very important convention. I know there is a concern about the supremacy of the European Convention on Human Rights, but to give effect to it, it is better to adopt it as part of domestic law. That would mean that a violation of a convention right would constitute a violation of domestic law. If there is a conflict with other laws, the Judiciary would be a suitable vehicle to resolve the issue at stake. There are significant problems with the Bill, first with the issue of definitions, which should be broadened to include all bodies with public functions, whether they be schools, the Civil Service, Departments or hospitals. The actions of those bodies are already subject to the Constitution, and since the content of the convention is similar, those bodies should be included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">There is also a problem with the remedies included in the Bill. They are not effective enough, and whatever is said about the Minister  having experienced a conversion on the road to Damascus, the reality is that many people in Ireland will have to head along the road to Strasbourg, not having an effective remedy in this State. The European Court has time and time again held that the possibility of getting a discretionary payment does not constitute an effective domestic remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">There should be a guaranteed system for the payment of compensation as of right by a body which is independent of the Government. As Deputies well know, the Attorney General is not as independent of the Government as we might like. We feel that individuals should not be subject to the discretion of the Attorney General in this instance. The Attorney General only recommends to the Government that it provide for a possible <i>ex gratia</i> payment, and we do not feel that that goes far enough. We also feel that the whole concept of monetary relief is not necessarily the most appropriate form in many instances. For instance, a person in a psychiatric institution might well not be seeking money but release from the institution, and that appears not to have been covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">There are also problems with the declaration of incompatibility. A declaration of incompatibility will not invalidate the rule of law to which it pertains and does not oblige the Government to amend the offending provision, so one might have a situation whereby the applicant will go to the Supreme Court, get a defective remedy there, and then have to go to the Strasbourg court citing the lack of an effective remedy at home in Ireland. Another issue is that of proofing. The Bill does not provide for any obligation to screen legislation to see if it is compatible with the convention. A certificate of compatibility should not prevent legislation being found incompatible with the convention at a later date. We feel that proofing should be carried out by the committee here in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Free legal aid is important and we would like to see the Government extending it to convention cases. Hitherto it has, generally speaking, not been provided for constitutional actions, and we feel that a person should be able to exercise his or her rights regardless of means. Looking at the cases over the years, one sees that a lack of finance has prevented cases from coming forward. Free legal aid should be provided in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Many NGOs and other groups in civil society have set out specific problems with the Bill's provisions as formulated. There are defects in individual provisions, but the main point is that people will get minimal redress for violation of their rights under the European Convention at domestic level. For instance, the Irish statute might simply be declared incompatible with the Convention, and the person might get an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, so there is no definite right to compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">There is nothing to fear if we incorporate the convention into Irish domestic law. Instances where a court is likely to find a measure consti tutional but contrary to the convention will surely be rare. The convention is in some respects superior to the Constitution. Article 10 dealing with free speech is an example. We must ensure the most effective incorporation and bringing the convention into Irish law is the way to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">If this Bill is passed, people will still have to go to Strasbourg, and that is an unacceptable incorporation or adoption of the convention in Ireland. We could deal with the issue by holding a referendum. We had one to give the courts the power to invalidate legislation as being incompatible with the treaties of the European Union and perhaps we should consider another. The proposed incorporation of the European convention does not go far enough. It should be directly incorporated into Irish law. People will still have to tread the long road to Strasbourg, something that imposes a significant penalty on individuals. We are concerned that insufficient action is being taken to incorporate the convention and legislation directly incorporating the convention into Irish law is the way forward.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_492">The issue that we are discussing is the kernel of human and fundamental rights contained in the convention. Our attitude to them says much about us as a country, what we want to achieve and our position on human, civil and fundamental rights. It has taken us over 50 years to introduce the convention into Irish law. We still have not done it, and the Bill has already spent over two years in the Houses of the Oireachtas without coming to fruition. That certainly says something about our international commitment to doing our best to ensure that our system of human rights is second to none and that we follow best practice. On that basis alone, surely we should make certain that we have at least the standards of other countries in the European Union or the Council of Europe, yet we are the very last to introduce this into legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">It is very important for us that we be seen to adopt best practice as it is something we are quick to talk about internationally. We pay lip service to Amnesty International and the wonderful work it does for human rights throughout the world. We quote the United Nations everywhere and stand under its mandate. We stand for human rights and see ourselves as a small country with a commitment to them. However, when it comes down to it, we do not incorporate the convention into domestic legislation. We are not doing it here. We are introducing a minimalist version of the European Convention on Human Rights, and that is not good enough. We should be introducing a maximal version.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">There are a number of reasons for that. I have already said that we like to see ourselves projected as a country that stands up for human rights across the globe. We have a fine record from East Timor to various African countries. In the context of this country's peace process we are endeavouring to achieve the rule of law and order, ensuring that there is no further discrimi nation on this island, that the old days are gone and that we have as many cross-Border activities reflecting co-operation as possible in order that we can have a system in the country which elicits maximum identification and support. We should have examined this issue in the context of ensuring full incorporation of the Convention on Human Rights in both Northern and Southern jurisdictions. However, we are developing them in a very dissimilar fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The issue is very symbolic of what we are trying to achieve regarding Northern Ireland: ensure that human rights operate right across the board, both south and north of the Border. For that reason, we should ensure full incorporation. The fact that the incorporation taking place provides very limited remedies, as has already been stated—</p>

      the measures he has taken over the past 12 months to address the chronic traffic congestion in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_497">The Government has been pro-active in its response to the challenge of traffic congestion in Dublin and has shown its continued commitment to enhancing transport infrastructure in Dublin through unprecedented levels of investment. Within the national development plan, a wide range of initiatives have been taken to upgrade transport infrastructure and services and to reduce congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Dublin Transportation Office policy document, "A Platform for Change", sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area in the period to 2016. As part of the DTO strategy, a number of major public transport improvements are currently under way, and these combined with traffic management measures and improvements to the road infrastructure in the Dublin area are expected to have significant impact on traffic flows in Dublin in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Demonstrable improvements in public transport arrangements and services have been achieved since 2000 under the current national development plan. There are now nine quality bus corridors in place in Dublin and I have recently asked the relevant authorities in the Dublin area to bring forward plans to double this number. Six of the existing QBCs have been  reviewed to identify areas for further improvement. A quality bus network project office has been established to speed up the introduction of additional bus priority measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Since 1997, Dublin Bus has embarked on a major fleet replacement and expansion programme. By the end of 2002, the fleet capacity of Dublin Bus increased by more than 23% compared with 1999. As a consequence, more than one third of the Dublin Bus fleet is now low floor and fully accessible. Bus Éireann has also significantly increased its capacity on commuter routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Major capacity improvements have been made to suburban rail services, with a significant increase in capacity on the Maynooth line in 2001. In addition, there has been almost a 50% increase in the number of DART cars since 2000 with a further 40 DART cars ordered which will be delivered next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The DTO traffic management grants are funding measures such as the strategic cycle network, pedestrian routes, computerised traffic signal control systems, travel and parking information systems and the development of local integrated land use and transport framework plans. Already, there are more than 170 kilometres of dedicated cycle-ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Taxi numbers in the Dublin area have increased in excess of 200%. Later this year, Irish Rail will bring into service 76 additional railcars for operation on Dublin suburban rail services while next year the Luas will become operational. In 2005, a further 40 DART cars will be put into service. Projects worth some €1.4 billion are currently under construction in the Dublin area.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_504">I thank the Minister for his reply. Deciphering what the Minister said, the only thing to happen in the past year was a 200% increase in the number of taxis, a matter we will come to later. In light of the fact that there are only four Garda motorcycles to keep traffic moving in the evening rush hour, that there will be traffic chaos at the Red Cow intersection and at Newland's Cross when Luas becomes operational, that both Luas and the port tunnel are running well over-budget and that the port tunnel will not be able to cater for high super-trucks, that the Phoenix Park tunnel has been left out of the strategic rail review and that we are still waiting for the direction signs for Dublin which were supposed to come in last autumn and which the Minister made the city council revise, is it not the case that absolutely nothing has happened in the year since the Minister took office except for the dramatic increase in taxi numbers? Even with that increase, there are no controls or standards in regard to who gets taxi licences.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_386" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_505">In the past year, substantial progress has been made on three big projects which will significantly help the traffic flow. The completion of the Luas, the M50 and the tunnel in the coming years – the M50 project is in the  courts but we can presumably deal with that soon, and the tunnel should be finished in about 48 months – will have an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Nonetheless, I must be honest about this. The number of cars registered in the Dublin area is growing dramatically. In 1993, 25,000 private cars were registered in Dublin city in one year; this year, almost 70,000 were registered. In one decade, the rate of car ownership has grown dramatically, which has to do with lower interest rates and better standards of living generally. However, these three projects will help greatly.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the number of taxis has increased from 3,000 to 11,000 in Dublin city in just over a year. A number of new quality bus corridors have been and are being put in place. These measures will help substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">However, it will be a constant battle. I will not, as Minister for Transport, tell the House that one fine day there will be no traffic jams or traffic. When the Deputy's time comes – or whoever it might be – to be in Government, I wish him luck if he makes the statements he has made today. The reality is that space is tight on the streets and the pace at which motor cars are being bought means that it will be an ongoing battle. We must make the necessary investments and be creative in traffic management to keep on top of this.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">The Minister points out that the opening up of Luas will have a dramatic impact. He is correct in that there will be a Mad Cow roundabout at the M50 where no-one will be able to get through.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Why have the quality bus corridors which have been launched or pencilled in not been opened? There is no co-ordination between Dublin City Council and some of the local authorities around Dublin to ensure that the quality bus corridors are put in place. Will the Minister ensure we can utilise the existing road space by ensuring there is a sufficient number of gardaí on the streets to keep the clearways open and the traffic moving? Will he extend the operating hours of Dublin Port? Those are two initiatives the Minister could have taken in the past 12 months and which have not been taken to date.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_391">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_516">Since outlining my proposals for regulatory and structural reform of public transport to the Public Transport Partnership Forum last November, I have met trade union delegations on four occasions. At our meeting on 4 February I agreed to bilateral discussions between my Department and the trade unions on the reform of the bus market in Dublin. A total of four bilateral meetings were held during February and March.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The most recent meeting with the trade unions took place last Thursday when the Taoiseach, I and the secretaries general of both our Departments met a delegation from congress. At that meeting it was agreed that there would be further contacts between congress and officials from our Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">From the discussions which have taken place, I am acutely aware of the concerns of the trade unions and their members and I hope they also fully understand that the primary objective of the proposals for the regulatory reform of public transport is the delivery of more and better quality public transport services to the travelling public at a reasonable cost to both the user and the taxpayer. The proposals are designed to use competition for the provision of services to stimulate better performance, improved efficiency and better cost effectiveness and to enable taxpayers to see clearly how funding for public transport is being spent to deliver service and to establish a clear link between payments from the taxpayer and performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">While I am anxious to make speedy progress on the implementation of a programme of regulatory and structural reform, I am also anxious to  continue a constructive dialogue with the trade unions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_392">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I am sure the Minister will accept that David Begg is a reasonable person who does not make statements lightly about the danger in which the Minister is putting the national pay agreement as a result of his actions in respect of CIE. Does the Minister accept there is a real problem in respect of the manner in which he is forcing his proposals on transport workers and a real danger that there will be repercussions in terms of national partnership? Does he accept that valid points are being put forward by the unions concerned, not just in their own self-interest but in respect of the points they make about the experience in the United Kingdom, in particular the disastrous outcome of privatisation there and the case being made for retaining public transport services in public ownership? What consideration has the Minister given to the points being made and is he prepared to discuss the points of principle at stake in this whole affair?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_393">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_521">I have made two sets of proposals. One is to open the Dublin Bus market to the private sector by 25% in 2004. I have also proposed that the holding company in CIE will be dissolved and the three companies established independently as State companies so that they can compete with each other and offer alternative services to the public. I have made it clear at all stages that I and the Government fully respect the social partnership arrangements and the agreements entered into, and I have the greatest respect for Mr. Begg. Having dealt with him in the past I know him to be very straight, fair and honest and I took careful note of what he said. I am aware that he has taken careful note of what I said also, which is that these reforms are important for the Government to consider and progress and I do not see any reason we cannot progress them in discussions with the union movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">In so far as there are issues to do with security of employment, pensions and terms and conditions, I have no difficulty in dealing with all of those. We can negotiate them to the satisfaction of the people who work in CIE today. I do not envisage compulsory redundancies of any sort but I envisage reform along the lines I have laid out. Incidentally, I was pleased to see Deputy Rabbitte's speech to his conference in Killarney. The section of the speech did not get to be delivered for time reasons but it was reported in <i>The Irish Times.</i> He is quoted as saying that transport systems can no longer be run for the benefit only of transport workers and that even though they have a vital input, they must be run for the benefit of consumers. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on that. I take that to mean that these reforms are in the interest of consumers and taxpayers and I look forward to pressing ahead with them in full consultation with the union movements as I prepare legislation to bring before this House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_523">The leader of the Labour Party made those comments when he was talking about the importance of putting the consumer at the forefront of public services, and that the consumers' concerns are paramount and not simply the concerns of transport workers. Experience has shown that in the vast majority of cases the most effective public transport system that can be provided is in the context of a publicly owned company. Again I refer to the experience in the UK. Will the Minister accept that part of the reason there has not been any kind of meeting of minds in this regard is that he has never explained exactly what he is trying to achieve. He appears to be hell-bent on competition for the sake of competition and he has not indicated to anybody how he believes the services might be improved by franchising 25% of the bus company in the Dublin area. Yesterday, Dublin Bus representatives appeared before the transport committee. Dublin Bus has done an outstanding job in recent years with modest increases in subvention. Will the Minister explain how he sees the transport system improving purely by bringing in private operators in the complete absence of any kind of regulation in this area?</p>

          <p eId="para_524">Two issues arise. On the UK point, I will try to debunk that myth at some stage because it is constantly trotted out on the floor of the House. The reality is that London city, which is a franchise operation, has a regulator. They go out to tender and they franchise all the routes in London city.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_526">I have the figures for the Deputy. Since that practice started, the number of people using buses in London has increased dramatically and the subsidy per travelling passenger has decreased dramatically. An area on which I agree with the Deputy, and I am not up for it, is that they made a fatal mistake in the UK in privatising the rail track. That was silly because the rail track is a strategic national asset and is better in State ownership. They made that mistake in the UK but if we look at the bus market in the UK, all the results are the same – the numbers of people travelling by bus grew dramatically and that means fewer cars.</p>

      <b>Mr. Eamon Ryan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      when he expects the Cabinet to make a decision on the business case proposal for the first phase of a Dublin metro as presented to him six months ago by the Railway Procurement Agency.
      [13883/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_410">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_541">Last year, the Government agreed that the development of a Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis as a public private partnership. It also decided that a link from the city centre to Dublin Airport was to be included in phase one. Since then, the Railway Procurement Agency has concentrated its work on developing proposals for this phase. A preliminary public consultation has taken place and a pre-qualification exercise for potential bidders was launched by the Railway Procurement Agency in mid-2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">In November 2002 my Department received the outline business case for phase one from the Railway Procurement Agency. The Dublin metro is the largest proposed infrastructure project in the history of the State. Careful consideration of the outline business case is being undertaken. The estimated costs are substantial and a number of additional aspects of the proposals are being assessed as part of my evaluation of the outline business case. These additional aspects concern the potential impact of the project on the general Government balance in the context of the EU stability and growth pact and the legal, planning and technical considerations based on practice elsewhere, particularly in Madrid where the authorities have developed a strong international reputation for the speedy completion of the Madrid metro extensions at relatively low cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I am also considering proposals for legislative change so as to accelerate and streamline the delivery of critical infrastructure projects, thereby reducing the cost of such infrastructure. Following completion of these evaluations by my Department in the coming weeks, I intend to bring proposals to the Cabinet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_411">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_544">The Minister is very concerned about the slow pace at which infrastructure is being introduced. Last year, the Government fortuitously announced three months prior  to the election that it would build a metro. I remind the Minister that it proposed not only to build a section from the city centre to the airport, but a full length system from Sandyford to the airport. His reply was, therefore, incorrect in that respect. The Railway Procurement Agency, a committed and efficient organisation, then went about its work in a highly effective manner and presented a detailed report to the Minister in mid-November.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">We are all concerned about the current delays. Why was the report delayed in the Department for seven months before being presented to Cabinet? The Minister has been giving out about the slow process involved in getting infrastructure built. Surely this case is the best example of this process. The Minister has a detailed report, yet it is clear from his answer that it will not be presented to Cabinet for a month or more. In what month does he envisage bringing the proposal to Cabinet?</p>
          <p eId="para_546">If the Minister is not able to proceed with the project because the Minister for Finance refuses to allow funding to be allocated to public transport or for other reasons, when will he start making alternative proposals? It is not permissible for us to wait until legislation on fast-tracking infrastructure is passed before we approve the project. We cannot allow the current position to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport this morning, we had a further example of what has been happening in Dublin for the past ten years, when another person came before the committee claiming to have found the magic solution to Dublin's transport problems and proposing that a certain type of system should be built. We now have utter confusion and the only person who can sort it out is the Minister by making a decision. When will he make a decision on the metro proposal and bring it to Cabinet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_548">The Cabinet has discussed a metro many times in the past year or two. I should be able to bring a substantive memorandum on the proposed metro to Cabinet in the next three or four weeks. I share the Deputy's concern. I would like to build a metro tomorrow and have it operational the week after. The reality is that the proposal would be the largest infrastructural project in the history of the State. As such, it is a complicated operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">More than 30 parties responded to the pre-qualification exercise launched by the Railway Procurement Agency in May 2002, including a large number of major companies from around the world. The exciting aspect of the exercise was that the same structure appeared time and again in the various expressions of interest, namely, that an internal or external consortium will design, build, finance and operate the scheme and the State would not start to pay for the project until the first train starts to run. I am considering these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I bluntly told the Railway Procurement Agency that I did not accept the nine years timeframe it  stated it would take before the first metro train would run nor the envisaged cost of €4.8 billion, and asked it to reconsider the matter. I invited the person who oversaw the Madrid metro project to make a presentation to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure so that we can see exactly what we have to copy. I share the Deputy's concern. A nine years timeframe and a cost of €4.8 billion is not acceptable to me or the Government. The agency charged with overseeing the process is aware of our position and is considering it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_551">One of the nine years to which the Minister refers will be the year it is taking the Government to decide on what it wants. Will the Minister consider publishing the report so that we on this side of the House who add to a healthier debate have access to its contents? Everyone is operating in the dark which adds to the confusion. Various details and conflicting figures on what the project would cost have been leaked to the newspapers. It is about time the Minister published the report or at least provided copies of it to the Opposition spokespersons on transport so that we can join in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Will the Minister consider alternative, possibly cheaper, options such as the construction of a single bore tunnel as opposed to a twin bore tunnel, which could significantly reduce costs? In addition, if it transpires that the Government cannot afford a metro system, will he present or recommend to Cabinet alternative schemes such as the proposal to roll out the Luas network in four or five additional lines, as proposed in the Dublin Transportation Office's Platform for Change plan? This option was part of plan B in the document in which it was proposed that we move to other public transport projects in the event that we cannot afford a metro system. Does the Minister have a second option along these lines to propose to the Cabinet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_414">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_553">I am strongly of the view that if we proceed with the metro proposal, we should do it properly. While I am not an engineer, it strikes me that a twin tunnel is better than a single bore tunnel for safety and operational reasons. In terms of alternatives, it would be a bad mistake for the country if we were to take a cheaper or clearly inferior option which left no room to expand because we were unable to afford an option which was obviously right in terms of the next 20, 30 or 40 years. I will not recommend to the Government an inferior product that will not stand the test of time 50, 60 or 100 years hence.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">There is no report as such. The Railway Procurement Agency made a presentation to me pointing out that there were, as I stated, 30 expressions of interest, outlining the structure of those expressions and detailing the breakdown of the €4.8 billion proposed cost. I can give Deputies opposite broad details of the information avail able on the €4.8 billion figure. This information has been in the newspapers and includes in broad terms risk, VAT, insurance and various other elements. The information is available if the Deputies wish to have it.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_423">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_564">The next discussions on this topic will be at the Council of Transport Ministers on 5 and 6 June. The current indications are that the Council may seek to finalise the mandate being sought by the European Commission to negotiate an open aviation area agreement between the EU and the USA. I am currently reflecting on the position I should adopt at the Council on behalf of Ireland. The main issues which I must take into account are the ruling of the European Court of Justice last November, the impact on Shannon Airport and its hinterland, the impact on tourism of increased access to Ireland, the opportunities for Aer Lingus to increase its business on transatlantic routes and Ireland's wider relationship with Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The current Government policy on Shannon Airport has been in place to assist the development of the airport. I am very much aware of the importance attached to transatlantic services at Shannon by business and tourism interests in the region. This will play an important part in my consideration of the issue and the House can be assured of my long-term support for Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I have asked my officials to examine, with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General, the basis on which the question of a negotiating  mandate on this subject may be resolved at the Transport Council. The advice is not yet finalised, but I understand that as the mandate embraces issues of Community competence and issues in which member states retain their competence, it could be argued that the agreement of all member states may be legally necessary. However, this view may not be shared by the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">While it is important to clarify these issues, it is not realistic to contemplate that any member state would refuse to permit the other member states of the Union to engage in multilateral negotiations with the United States on a matter which they wish to pursue on a multilateral basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_568">We need to bear in mind that the finding made last November did not affect Ireland. Clearly, the Commission is anxious to proceed with a new arrangement between the United States and the European Union, which could be detrimental to Shannon Airport if it is not handled properly by the Government. The Minister said he is anxious to move forward in terms of expanding transatlantic services. What plans does he have to expand those services on a year-round basis? That is the key issue for Shannon Airport. As regards balanced regional development, the people of the mid-west are positive about the issue. It is important to get the best possible deal for Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">As regards the hub concept, there is a view in Brussels that Shannon Airport could be used as a hub for transatlantic flights, particularly now that the European Union is enlarging. Will the Government pursue that at EU level and ensure it is put on a statutory footing? Many promises were made in the past. The Minister will soon be appointed president of the Council of Transport Ministers and he will carry the flag. Shannon Airport would be an ideal hub. It does not have congested skies and it has the necessary infrastructure, air bridges and parking facilities. What does the Minister think of that concept?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_577">The bypass is on the way. Shannon Airport has a tremendous future. The hub concept the Deputy mentioned is a runner. I know the Deputy has felt strongly about that for some time. It is realistic to think of Shannon Airport as a hub between East and West in the context of new members of the European Union. I know the authorities in Shannon are actively looking at that and I will help them in any way I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">It is worth pointing out that Aer Lingus has indicated to me that it would, given the right circumstances, commence new services on two new routes, possibly to the east and west coasts of the United States. The company proposes to commence a further two new routes with one additional aircraft, bringing a total of four new United States routes into operation. It tells me it could do that over a 12 month period. It is worth noting that Aer Lingus has put on offer to Shannon Airport substantial new business but, unfortunately, it is connected with the issue of the bilateral agreement. Perhaps Aer Lingus and the airport could discuss that further. Aer Lingus has also told me that it would like to co-chair with its United States partner, American Airways, to serve a range of other United States domestic points. That means the Aer Lingus flight code could serve those points on American Airways aircraft. In the longer term, Aer Lingus has indicated to me that it sees significant prospects for opening further direct routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">It is clear there is a strong natural transatlantic market for Shannon Airport going forward. With the right support locally and nationally, a dynamic and efficient airport can move to the forefront of airports internationally. There is a lot of excitement in terms of Shannon Airport and there is a lot of new business. I look forward to working with Shannon to get that new business for the airport.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">Aer Lingus is a small airline and we are a small country. US airlines do not have to travel into Ireland. The big carriers in Europe, such as Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways, could take over the European scene. Is there a danger in that regard? There is not any guarantee that Aer Lingus will get extra routes to other destinations, although it says it wants to get into 12 or more destinations. Will the Minister push the hub concept at European level? It would be a good move for Shannon Airport if the hub concept could be put on a statutory basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">I will promote that at European level and during our Presidency. However, the hub concept is not based on a legal document, but on a commercial decision. A hub becomes a hub because airlines negotiate to fly in and out.  I will work with Shannon Airport to achieve that.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 84, 88, 93, 136 and 157 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">As regards the restructuring of the CIE companies, I established a restructuring implementation group to oversee the restructuring of CIE. I met with the boards of CIE and its subsidiaries during December and January and discussed the restructuring proposals with them. At present the focus is on the detailed preparatory work required for the restructuring. I will bring a progress report on the work undertaken to date to Government in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">As regards my proposals for the appointment of an independent regulatory authority and the introduction of competition into the bus market in the greater Dublin area, I have already outlined details of my discussions with the trade unions in my earlier reply. During this period my Department has continued with its preparatory work. While it would not be appropriate to go into detail pending completion of this preparatory work, consideration by Government and further discussions with the trade unions, I will try to respond in general terms to the questions raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">My November 2002 proposals for the reform of the Dublin bus market involved the phased introduction of tendering by an independent regulatory authority or regulator for the exclusive provision of bus services on particular routes or in particular areas. In addition to the benefits outlined in my reply to the priority question on the reform programme for public transport, this would allow for a direct comparison of services provided by different operators, including Dublin Bus. The detail of how tendering might be implemented is still under consideration, including the deployment of staff, buses and garages. It is my understanding that virtually all Dublin Bus routes require subvention and, therefore, cross-subsidisation is not a material issue. Tendering of a package of routes would allow for internal cross-subsidisation between profitable and non-profitable routes to be taken into account in tender pricing.</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_595">As regards the point about cross-subsidisation, I would like to hear the Minister's view on one of the main points made by the transport unions about the proposal to privatise 25% of the routes in Dublin. Does the Minister accept that the routes which will be of interest to private operators will be those which are profitable and  that there will be a certain amount of cherry-picking, as is always the case in such situations? If Dublin Bus loses those profitable routes, it will seriously diminish its ability to cross-subsidise the socially necessary but unprofitable routes? Does the Minister accept, therefore, that that will result in a net loss to the taxpayer in terms of revenue and that eventually it will result in a situation where a higher level of subvention will be required to keep the socially desirable routes operational? I would like to hear the Minister's specific views on that because he has not addressed that point in any forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">As regards a regulator, does the Minister accept that the most urgent need in the transport industry is to appoint a regulator? We already have a free-for-all in relation to the bus services outside Dublin. A bus regulator must be appointed as a matter of urgency to stop the same thing happening in Dublin, which could lead to chaos. What is the Minister's timescale for that?</p>

I can look at that again if the Deputy wishes. A franchise is not head to head competition as such. One competes to win the franchise on the route. While CIE would not be eligible to compete for those in the initial stages, I do not see any reason Dublin Bus could not tender for those routes when the market is properly opened up later on. If it is a loss making route, one tenders for the taxpayers' subsidy. That is a well known structure around the world.</p>

Does the Minister further agree that a primary requirement, other than the appointment of a regulator, is a greater Dublin land use and transport authority? It is included in the legislative programme but the Taoiseach stated earlier there is no sense of urgency about it in the Minister's Department because he is proceeding with other legislation first. However, an overriding transport and planning authority has not been established to decide which bus routes are needed and which ones are selected for franchising. We will, there fore, not get anywhere. I do not see how the Minister can introduce a franchising system unless the proper transport and planning authority is in place. That legislation, and not the legislation being introduced before it, should be a primary concern of the Minister's.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I accept appropriate consideration must be given to their role, but the Deputy's view is also valid. I try in so far as I can, in formulating my proposals, to ask what does the taxpayer and the consumer want from his or her transport system. I then bring the proposals to the unions, IBEC and the other players, and usually, though not all the time, that is when we experience heavy weather. However, my starting point always in the transport brief is what does the travelling public require. Deputy Rabbitte was correct about the valuable input of transport workers. However, while we take their viewpoint on board, it is not the only one. The transport system is not only in place for those who operate it but for the consumer. The House should continue to send that message. I agree with the Deputy in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">With regard to the land use authority, I have informed the Deputy once or twice previously that the reason I am holding back on the legislation is that it is an enormous overlay authority. It is supposed to regulate taxis, buses, sign off on the development plans of seven county councils, second guess those councils and order them around by telling them they cannot have a zoning plan here and a housing development there. I reflected on the time it would take for that monstrous legislation to see the light of day following the resolution of all those issues. I have been asking myself what is the need for an eighth authority to tell the seven local authorities what they know they should do in terms of development. If I sense in the coming weeks that I can knock the legislation into shape, I will try but I have deliberately held it back.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">I take it from the Minister's reply to Deputy Shortall that he is considering appointing a regulator. It would be a positive development to provide such co-ordination.  Everybody agrees competition is needed. Does the Minister agree a quality service that will deliver for the consumer is required if he is to succeed in achieving his targets? For example, competition was introduced on bus routes in County Cavan but, ultimately the consumer did not benefit. Regulation is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">There are proposals for the establishment of five agencies to regulate the bus sector in conjunction with the Department. If the Minister adopts that mechanism, it will cost millions of euro to run per annum and the consumer will have to pay for deregulation and competition without receiving a net benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I acknowledge the demands for the appointment of a regulator. I will move the appointment up the agenda and bring it before the House. The reason we have held back on it is that the regulator needs to have a market in Dublin to regulate and if we ended up in a scenario where the Dublin market had not opened, the regulator would have nothing to do. However, I take the point that if we go down that route, it would be wise to press ahead and appoint the regulator so that he or she can implement whatever market opening the House agrees. I will try to press on in an orderly fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Members think I am hung up on competition but this relates to a question of choice for the consumer. If the travelling public has choices, they can dictate which routes and companies they want to support. That will mean they can vote with their feet and that is the best from of control of public expenditure at the end of the day.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">As regards appointing the regulator first before proceeding, I will have to reflect on that to see whether it is the wise course of action. My original intention before this discussion was that the regulator proposals and the market opening would happen at the same time. The regulator would start work on the same day that we open the market. I see the wisdom in perhaps fast tracking the regulator but I would want to be fairly sure that in doing so, we would move on to the market opening. Otherwise I will have a regulator with a nice title, a big job and a glossy report but with no market to regulate.</p>

In relation to either Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann tendering for routes, the Minister will have to allocate routes in a transparent way. Can he put those mechanisms in place during the restructuring of CIE? I also ask the Minister to comment on the costs of the letters of comfort that are currently with CIE employees and on the impact that will have because there is no point making savings in relation to tendering and franchising if we are going to cost the taxpayer a great deal of money at the end of the day. Finally, could the Minister comment on the issue of integrated ticketing, which will be crucially important if competition is to be successful?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_643">There are three issues there. Regarding route transparency, a regulator would by statute have to ensure complete transparency in franchising routes. That would be the regulator's legal responsibility. On the letters of comfort, I want to make clear that the figures that  appeared in newspaper headlines recently are totally inaccurate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_645">If anything, the restructuring should save us money without entering into the kind of substantial costs that are envisaged. My legal advice in regard to the letters of comfort is to the effect that there is no such legal duty on the State. The section of the relevant Act says that if a subsidiary company ceases to be then the workers can go back to the main company. However, I am talking about taking out the main company, so workers would stay with the subsidiary companies. Members can see the moot legal point here. Our argument will be that once workers' employment is guaranteed it does not matter whether they work for Iarnród Éireann or a CIE holding company. They are both State-owned companies and, as such, there should be no question of compensation in the sense of letters of comfort. I would envisage and look forward to saving from these schemes, not accruing costs, and certainly not costs of the order I have seen in headlines recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I am fully committed to integrated ticketing and am annoyed at progress so far. The RPA is dealing with it and tell me that the full system is still on schedule for the first part of 2005.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_661">Design and construction of the Dublin Port tunnel is a matter for the NRA and Dublin City Council as project managers. Work is well under way on construction of the tunnel on the basis of the motorway order made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in December 1999. Some 23 months of the 43 month construction contract have been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I am informed by the NRA that approximately one third of the bored tunnel has now been constructed and major sections of the cut and cover tunnels have also been completed. Raising the height of the tunnel at this stage of the project would require reconstruction of works already completed, redesign of work, very significant additional costs and would significantly delay the completion and opening of the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Given the expense involved tunnels are always engineered to optimally provide for their functions in the minimum space safely possible. Internationally, this means that height provisions that might be applied for relatively inexpensive bridge structures on surface roads are rarely replicated in underground tunnels. The height of the Dublin Port tunnel is also on a par with best international practice in terms of tunnel heights. In a survey of 12 international countries, ten of those had height provisions equal to or less than the Dublin Port tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The Dublin Port Company has been monitoring the height of truck traffic on the busiest exit from the port, Tolka Quay, which accounts for more than three quarters of total truck traffic, continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week and has supplied the results of its survey to Dublin City Council and the NRA. Of the total of nearly half a million trucks monitored, 99.4% are below 4.65 metres in height. This equates to an average of approximately 30 over height trucks  per day from about 9,000 trucks. The Dublin Port tunnel as currently designed can cater for more than 99.4% of all truck traffic entering and leaving the port.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The trend in Europe is towards limiting the physical height of trucks on public roads and most countries operate a maximum height provision of just four metres. Given all these factors, I am satisfied with the decision of the NRA and Dublin City Council to proceed with the construction.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">I listened with interest to the Minister's response on the metro for Dublin. We need to look to the next 50 to 60 years and we do not want to build something inferior. Is it not the case that the survey that was done on Dublin Port surveyed one of the four exits of Dublin Port? Is it not the case that 10% of the vehicles using Irish ferries are over the height of the Dublin Port tunnel and that over the next ten years that will increase to 20%? Is it not the case that the resund tunnel connecting Denmark and Sweden, an EU funded project, is 6.1 metres high? I also put it to the Minister that the tunnel we are building has a diameter of 12 metres. All we are looking for is the inner core of that to be extended by 30 centimetres.</p>

          <p eId="para_667">I will certainly check the figures the Deputy has given. I do not have responses to the specific examples he has given but, to repeat, in counting nearly half a million trucks on the busiest exit from the port, the Dublin Port Company found that 99.4% of them were below 4.6 metres. This is the clearance height proposed by the tunnel constructors.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">It is probably worth pointing out that the height of tunnels is, 4.6 metres in Denmark, 4.5 metres in France and Germany and Japan, not that the latter will worry us—</p>

          <p eId="para_670">It is 4.5 metres in The Netherlands, 4.6 metres in Norway, 4.5 metres in Switzerland and 4.9 metres in the United States. Thus, they are virtually all around 4.5 or 4.6 metres. Our tunnel is 4.65 metres in terms of clearance so in international terms this is substantially higher than in most countries.</p>

Given the safety considerations in a tunnel – namely that no traffic can be left in a tunnel and all traffic must exit – is the Minister aware of the serious concerns of certain traffic engineers that there will be severe traffic management difficulties in the port area once the tunnel is opened and significant volumes are coming to the port area without an obvious access or exit point other than the East Link Bridge?</p>

          <p eId="para_681">A traffic management plan will be introduced by the city council around the port area. The port tunnel is a major investment for the people that will deal with approximately 9,000 trucks, which is a significant volume. The Deputy's point about the city centre is one for Dublin City Council. I greatly support the idea and will make it clear to the council that the trucks should not be allowed in the city centre once the port tunnel is open.</p>

The Minister has indicated to the haulage industry that he will ban trucks from entering the city centre. Will he allow those trucks to travel toll free if they stay away from the city centre? In view of the fact that the PD and Fianna Fáil Government is in tatters, will the Minister be around to implement this policy?</p>

          <p eId="para_683">I will take the last question first, if I may. That is a matter for the Deputy's judgment; I plan to be around. It is not fruitful to consider whether mistakes were made. As I have already indicated, the reality is the tunnel will  have a clearance of 4.5 metres in circumstances where most other countries have clearances of 4.5 metres. We very much adhere to the EU norm. I appreciate that the authorities in the UK take a slightly different view of this, as they tend to do about many European issues.</p>

In light of the fact that in Denmark where there is a clearance of 4.6 metres and Sweden where there is a clearance of 4.5 metres, a tunnel connecting those countries has a clearance of 6.1 metres it make logical sense for us to do this. Is it not the case that when the tunnel was originally planned it had the clearance for super-trucks and somebody forgot to put in extractor fans, explaining why we do not have that clearance today?</p>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      if he will report on the recent work of the Task Force on Road Haulage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_522">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_693">In response to fuel cost difficulties and other significant challenges facing the haulage sector in autumn 2000, a task force was  established by the Taoiseach to respond to the problems of the industry. The task force completed its work with the production of a "Programme of Action for the Road Haulage Industry". This document was published by the Department of Public Enterprise in February 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">To ensure implementation of the programme, a steering group chaired by my Department, with representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA), the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, and other Departments and agencies attending as appropriate, is in place. The steering group also provides an opportunity to members to raise and discuss any issues of relevance to the road haulage industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Most recently, the work of the group has been focusing specifically on the problem of illegal haulage. It is estimated that about 15% of haulage vehicles on the road are operating illegally. In addressing this problem, an enforcement forum, set up by the group, which comprises Garda, Customs and Excise and Department of Transport enforcement representatives, meets in tandem with the steering group. It continues to monitor the effectiveness of the enforcement regime and to propose improvements in the system of roadside checkpoints and premises inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">A structured system for submitting information on instances of illegal haulage to my Department is in operation and has recently been enhanced by the introduction of a freephone service for reporting complaints against illegal operators. All information received is investigated by my Departments transport officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"><i>Additional information.</i>The increased co-operation and intelligence sharing between my Department, the IRHA, Garda and other enforcement agencies has resulted in increased levels of detection and prosecution of illegal operators. Just as important, it has facilitated the identification and prosecution of those companies who are illegally employing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The priority now is to build on enforcement initiatives to date by introducing a system of on-the-spot fines for illegal haulage offences that will target both illegal operators and those that employ them. A further initiative due to come into effect shortly is the issue of a clearly identifiable haulage license disc in respect of all authorised vehicles. Such a system of discs displayed on authorised vehicles will contribute to more effective enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Working together in partnership through the programme of action steering group will ensure continually improved targeting and elimination of illegal haulage operations. In this way we can ensure a robust and viable industry that will contribute to the success of those involved in it, and the economy generally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_523">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_700">I thank the Minister for his response. This group was established because of fuel prices at the time. I come back to the issue of the Dublin Port tunnel; if the volumes transported are increased, overall costs will be reduced resulting in improved efficiencies for exporters, which means jobs. While I welcome the introduction of a freephone number, it is just like the penalty points system. We can report all these but very little enforcement takes place which leads to the huge problems with illegal haulage.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Following the proposal by the French Government to introduce taxes on non-toll roads, which will again have a huge impact on exports out of this country, will the Minister ensure this matter is brought up at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers to ensure there is no additional tax on exports from this country?</p>

          <p eId="para_702">Enforcement is always an issue and 15% of haulage vehicles are estimated to be operating illegally. Every pressure will be kept up to tackle this figure and reduce it. In answer to the question about the tunnel, there is no danger to exports or imports from the height of the tunnel. Some 99.4% of all trucks can get through the tunnel and the question is whether we need the other 0.6% in the country. My judgment is that we do not.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_712">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 86, 124 and 161 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I am aware of the recent report of the EU committee on petitions in relation to their fact finding mission to Ireland in connection with the effects of taxi liberalisation. I met with the delegation from the committee on 4 April 2003 and outlined the background to tax liberalisation and the establishment of the independent three person taxi hardship panel to them. I also explained that the panel was established by the Government to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of liberalisation and that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. This position remains unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. Any payments to be made as a result of this implementation will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by taxi licence holders arising from the liberalisation of the taxi market. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons is being progressed as quickly as possible in order to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis. Every effort is being made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of the panel recommendations as soon as possible but I have no current proposals for any payments beyond the recommendations of the panel report.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">On 19 November 2002 the Government approved the establishment, initially on a non- statutory basis, of the office of the national taxi regulator. In this context, the preparation of the necessary legislation to support the establishment of a commission for taxi regulation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">As an interim measure, I have appointed an interim chairman of the commission pending the recruitment of a statutory chairman and Mr. Farrelly has commenced a series of detailed consultations with those involved in the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and other interest groups with a view to assessing and addressing issues relating to standards in the industry. I have indicated that I am prepared to act on any recommendations proposed by Mr. Farrelly for urgent changes to the current regulations on standards proposed following this consultation. I have also asked Mr. Farrelly to progress, as a priority, the implementation of the findings of the panel report.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">As indicated to the EU committee on petitions, I am available to meet with the FAIR group again and would hope to do so at a mutually convenient date in the future.</p>

Following its visit here, the EU delegation stated that the Government has a moral and political responsibility to provide proper redress to families and individuals. Does the Minister agree that €15,000 is unacceptable for a widow with dependants who may be repaying a loan of up to €100,000? The Minister gave a commitment to the EU delegation that he would review the levels of compensation. In light of the fact that over €60 million has been collected through the issuing of licences, will he review the levels of compensation being paid to particular sets of individuals?</p>

We want to engage in this and to come up with a scheme that is fair to everybody concerned, and particularly to those people who have suffered a serious injustice as a result of the overnight deregulation. Does the Minister intend meeting with us to agree a new schedule of payments in the near future?</p>

However, I indicated that there may be scope within the report from the taxi hardship panel, within the overall level of funding envisaged by the Government, to examine what levels of payment can be made as long as relationships between the payments are kept reasonably intact. I cannot stand over any wholesale un-picking of an independent report from a taxi hardship panel that comprised top professional people who, over quite a long period, came up with a report and who recommended payments, not for compensation but for hardship.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_737">This side of the House is anxious to ensure that we have the maximum incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in our domestic law. That is why we want a direct incorporation rather than an indirect incorporation and a full-blooded incorporation rather than the minimalist approach the Minister is taking here. This is the fundamental piece of human rights legislation in the European context and we are now part of the family of European nations. We are the last country in the Council of Europe to incorporate this body of rights into legislation. We should do it to a maximum rather than a minimum degree. We can put in whatever caveats are required but the entire <i>corpus</i> should be in the legislation rather than the interpretative fashion presented here.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I referred earlier to some of the legislation's flaws. The manner in which we are passing the legislation creates the unusual term, incompatibility, which means that we will find on some occasions that the European Convention on Human Rights will be incompatible with our own legislation or <i>vice versa.</i> The cumbersome mechanism which is put in place to resolve that incompatibility is ridiculous in the manner in which it is presented. It is not the kind of legal provision we should make for something as important as the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights. This is a very weak section for dealing with remedies that arise from incompatibilities. It is ironic that Article 13 of the Convention is entitled “The right to an effective remedy”, as it seems the first step we are to take will breach that Article and provide an ineffective remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">How will the Minister respond to that? We have an ineffective remedy in that it only provides for one form of remedy. It does not provide options for any other form of remedy, irrespective of the nature of the incompatibility. Even if the incompatibility exists it is allowed to continue, so even if one gets a remedy the legal defect is allowed to remain, as a defect, on our statutes. There is a total contradiction between what we are seeking to do here and the terminology the Minister is using in the provisions of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">It is not good enough that this is as far as we have got. At this late stage we call again on the Minister's good sense to see if he will accept a nice amendment in my name, which states that the Convention provisions shall be part of the law of the State. A nice line like that would ensure our full commitment to the incorporation of the Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The Minister is to introduce a new Immigration Bill and yesterday at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights we discussed with the Human Rights Commission whether there were any laws, European or international, which might be incompatible with that Bill's provisions regarding carrier liability. We listed the Geneva Convention, international human rights legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights. Depending on the circumstances of a genuine asylum seeker being refused access to the shores of Ireland because of the provisions of the Immigration Bill, it was acknowledged that the Bill could be in breach of several international conventions, including the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">We will have to look at this area also to ensure that the domestic legislation we introduce does not breach our international conventions, even though we are implementing the European Convention on Human Rights in a less than full-blooded fashion. This matter is at the core of the Bill. The debate and decision on this amendment will provide the substance and tenor of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">An issue was raised earlier in relation to the Good Friday Agreement. The rest of the debate regarding direct incorporation will continue as my amendments and others' come up. Previous contributors on direct incorporation have spoken quite well of the need for it and I will expand on the issue later.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The effect of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights is an act of completion specifically mandated by section 9, strand 3 of the Good Friday Agreement, which deals with rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity. It states that the Government will "bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights."  That includes the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">It also commits the Government to "ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain" in the Six Counties.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_746">It says "Northern Ireland".</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_549">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_747">I ended the quotation –"Northern Ireland" if the Minister wishes but at least he knows what it says. The method of incorporation proposed by the Minister does not equal the equivalent level in the Six Counties, Northern Ireland or whatever title he wishes to give that statelet.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The Minister obviously believes his approach is in compliance with the Good Friday Agreement equivalence obligation. The British approach obviously reflects the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy and the fact that they have no Constitution. Nevertheless, the devolved Assemblies are explicitly bound by the Convention and are prohibited from passing any legislation contrary to the Act or Convention themselves. The Human Rights Act 1998 is treated as a constitutional document for the Northern statelet and contains a number of provisions specifically designed to compensate for the limitations of parliamentary supremacy, including wide, positive obligations on public authorities to act in accordance with the Act and Article 6, a wide definition of public authority and an obligation on the Government to declare compatibility or otherwise. There is also a mechanism to vet compatibility and, most importantly, an obligation to take remedial action if the declaration of incompatibility is issued by a court. The Minister's proposals contain none of those elements, hence the concerns raised not only by the Opposition but by all the groups which made submissions to the committee and Deputies to try to ensure best practice. Instead of having less than exists in the Northern state, we should have at least an equivalent level or higher if possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The Minister's approach is minimalist and our approach to the European Convention on Human Rights is minimalist in the extreme in that of all the EU states we have the worst method of incorporation proposed. Ours is the last approach and the most minimalist in the EU. We should  have learned from other countries and adopted best practice; we should have set an example to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">At this late stage I ask the Minister to take on board the concerns we have and to accept some of the amendments we have tabled to try to ensure direct incorporation of the European Convention.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_550">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_751">I have listened carefully to the arguments made in favour of the principle of Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment. This is not the first time I have heard these arguments; I have considered and reconsidered them because they have been made repeatedly both in public debate and on Second and Committee Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">There is a kind of popular cant that the Government is engaging in some way in a minimalist, less than full or inadequate incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. That is demonstrably false. What the Government is doing is full-blooded and consistent and we have gone to the fullest extent permissible under the Constitution. There are many good arguments as to why the way we have gone is dramatically superior to the way others are suggesting we should go. I am proud of the way we are doing it because it is full-blooded, comprehensive, thoroughgoing and fully workable in terms of our court procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">We have to remember that we live in a state with a written Constitution unlike the United Kingdom whose people do not. That written Constitution is unique in the European Union for a whole series of reasons, reasons which sometimes, in the modern babble of human rights speak, are fashionable to ignore. The first and probably the most substantial quality of our Constitution is that it is unamendable save by the will of the people. That means the people – I particularly ask Deputy Ó Snodaigh to bear this in mind – are sovereign in the matter of what is in and outside the Constitution. No Government can amend that Constitution without the people's direct authority expressed through a referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">If we were to say some international convention and its court were to become binding upon the people by way of a constitutional amendment of the Constitution, it would, for the first time, transfer sovereignty in relation to the fundamental determination of our human rights outside this jurisdiction and into the hands of a court not appointed by the people and in circumstances in which the people would not, in effect, be in direct control of the content of our fundamental human rights law. Those who argue for what they call the direct incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law – I believe it is a complete misnomer and misconception – are arguing for the right of a tribunal, over which we have no control whatever, to interpret a convention in a way which we cannot predict and in a  manner which has constitutional effect in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">I will give Members an example. If the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg was to say – I do not believe it will happen, but it could – that in the case of a complex crime, the reasons for a verdict must always be given before somebody can be convicted, it could be argued that the common law system, for instance, of a jury trial in which the issue is reduced to one proposition of guilty or not guilty, would be inconsistent with that jurisprudence. I am not suggesting that this will happen because I think there are plenty of reasons it would not.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">In the last analysis, the choice as to whether we have what we call "jury trial" or require juries to set out long chapters and written judgments in cases is a matter for the people to decide and not for some foreign court. If we were to put into our Constitution a clause in those circumstances which gave equality or even supremacy over our Supreme Court and the existing practice in Ireland, as decided by the people, to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, we would be surrendering our sovereignty in this important matter to a court whose decision would be, effectively, unappealable and irreversible in Irish law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_757">We are not arguing that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_552">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_758">If the European Convention on Human Rights had direct effect in Irish law and if that means that decisions of the court in Strasbourg have direct effect in Ireland – I presume that is what is being proposed – a foreign court, effectively, decides matters, which are of fundamental importance in Ireland, on a right at least equal to and perhaps in a superior way to the way in which the Supreme Court does at the moment. That is a road down which I do not propose to travel and down which the people would say, if they reflected on it for any considerable period of time, that under no circumstances would they go.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The European Convention on Human Rights is not a shadow constitution, was not drafted to be a constitution for any member state of the Council of Europe and was not intended to be incorporated as the constitution of any member state. Each member state of the Council of Europe, which subscribes to the European Convention on Human Rights, is expected to have its own constitution, remedies and system which are expected to be compatible with that convention but not identical to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Our Constitution is, in many ways, vastly superior – this point must be emphasised again and again – to the level of protection of fundamental human rights accorded to citizens of member states of the European convention. I make no apology for that proposition. Irish citizens, uniquely among the states of Europe, have the right of access to the courts of the land to test any legislation or administrative act by reference to a  written Constitution which they alone can amend and change. This is the only republic which accords a direct right of action to every citizen, in circumstances of this kind, to annul legislation on the basis that it is incompatible with the Constitution which the people alone are in a position to change. There are many other systems for constitutional protection in Europe and there are many constitutional courts in Europe but we alone in Europe have a system along the lines of the High Court and its full and original jurisdiction which permits Irish citizens to challenge any law by reference to the terms of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">Giving the convention the force of law in the State would, in effect, turn the convention into some form of quasi-constitution or shadow constitution because what the convention means can only be decided on a day to day basis by reference to judicial decisions and dicta of a court in Strasbourg which is constantly developing the jurisprudence of that convention. It is not possible simply to say the convention shall have the effect of law if at any given stage we, as a sovereign Legislature, wake up one morning to find that the convention means something new or something which we did not understand, has some new implication for civil liberty or that the court in Strasbourg has reversed its decision and stated that some former decision made by it is no longer applicable or is to be substantially changed in the light of changing circumstances. It is not simply possible to say it is an amendment of the law in the same sense that an amendment of the landlord and tenant Act can be passed by this House. It is not of that nature because the jurisprudence and the force of the convention are something which move and develop with time and in ways which no legislature can fully comprehend.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">I will give Members an example. The people of the United Kingdom might have thought that people who lived in the flight path of Heathrow Airport may or may not have a claim against excessive night flights but they would have been very surprised if, in 1950 or 1960, they were told that in the closing years of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st century, the court in Strasbourg would interpret the domestic rights of the citizen of the United Kingdom as being infringed by the operation of the excessive night flights through Heathrow Airport. I do not want to argue the merits of that case save to say that in an issue of that kind, which involves balancing individuals' rights and against a state's right, it is fundamentally a decision to be made by the United Kingdom and its people and not something which most people would have anticipated would fall to be determined by a decision in the court in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Under our Constitution, this House, the Seanad and the President form the Oireachtas, and the sole and exclusive right to make laws for this State is vested in the Oireachtas. This is not some simple monopoly which exists on paper, but the outward expression of that on which Irish republicanism is fundamentally based, i.e. the  sovereignty of the Irish people to determine their institutions and laws and how these should work. We are concerned with the right of the people, through their Legislature, to determine their laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">We have a system in which our courts interpret our law and they do so subject to one overriding rule, namely, that every organ of the State, including the Oireachtas, is bound to uphold the Constitution and that while the people are free to amend it, the bodies with the ultimate right to determine what it means are the High Court and the Supreme Court on appeal. Nobody else is competent to determine what our Supreme Court and High Court can determine in respect of the Constitution and nobody else's interpretation of that document is valid or coercive as a matter of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The courts cannot be instructed by this House to disregard the clear intention of the Oireachtas. It is not competent for either House or both Houses of the Oireachtas to direct the courts to interpret their laws by reference to the decisions of some third party in a way which is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the people. It is not possible or competent for this House to say to the courts, "You must disregard what we are saying if it is inconsistent with what some other person thinks should be the law in either Europe or in Ireland."  The Oireachtas, by virtue of its monopoly to legislate, and the Supreme Court, by virtue of its function to interpret the laws of the Oireachtas and to apply them, are collectively bound to work out fully the will of the people in any given case.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">We are dealing with past law, which is already on the Statute Book. Given the incorporation approach to the European convention, the force of the law in the State, in the sense that that phrase is used here, would amount to a continual, rolling and uncertain amendment of every law of the State depending on the interpretation of the convention by the courts of our country at any given point. If one was to say, "All law in Ireland is hereby amended so that it is fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights," one would be inviting the court to say, in respect of any statute anywhere which is the subject of any dispute in any court, "When the Oireachtas passed Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's version of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001, it gave us the right to reinterpret the legislation in accordance with our view of what the court in Strasbourg would do if it were looking at it."  It would be inviting the courts to say, "Notwithstanding all the previous decisions made about the legislation in question, that legislation now means something different, and if its clear language is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, it does not mean anything at all and will have no force."</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Our Constitution confers on our courts the sole and complete jurisdiction to decide whether our laws comply with the Constitution. However, no court is competent to amend or annul or find  devoid of meaning any statute by reference to some other legal instrument or treaty, save the Treaty of Rome or the European treaties which the people have expressly incorporated into our law and given a constitutional status. Unless we go down that road with the European Convention on Human Rights, for which Deputy Ó Snodaigh seemed to argue, the notion of direct incorporation is effectively creating massive uncertainty over the meaning of all Irish law enacted to this point. More seriously, it is not possible, nor will it be possible, for this House to invite the courts, three years before the enactment of legislation inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights, to disregard that legislation and say that it is of no effect. We are not competent to do so under our Constitution as a Parliament. We cannot invite a court in the future to disregard a future statement by an Irish Parliament of what it believes the law should be by reference to a prior instruction to disregard anything which happens to be inconsistent with Strasbourg jurisprudence. We cannot do so for a very good reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I only say these things because there is a significant misinformation campaign to the effect that there is some constitutional direct incorporation method which I am choosing blithely to ignore and that it is a matter of wilfulness on my part to choose some lesser species of incorporation because I somehow feel more attracted to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">It has been said three times, if not four, that we are doing less than the United Kingdom is doing. Nothing could be further from the truth. If one looks at section 3 of the Bill, one will see that we have instituted a general obligation on the part of every organ of the State, as defined in this statute, to exercise all its functions in accordance with the  European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, we have provided a head of tort, a form of claim for compensation, for anybody damaged by the failure of an organ of the State to do so. Based on all the wisdom poured into our ears by all the experts, is there any Deputy who thinks that a similar form of compensation is available in the United Kingdom?</p>

That is not available to any United Kingdom subject of Her Majesty.

          <p eId="para_779">Including somebody who is – we will come to that in a second. The Irish statute goes further than its equivalent in the United Kingdom because it gives the Irish citizen the right to sue his or her county council, or health board or a vast range of other institutions, if those institutions infringe his or her rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. People argue that we are doing nothing that the United Kingdom has not done and we are not doing everything it has done. That is not so. Section 3 is a radical and far-reaching provision which has no parallel in United Kingdom legislation. I wish someone, at some stage, among all the experts who have been whispering sweet nothings into the Deputies' ears on this subject, might have acknowledged that this is far in advance of what the United Kingdom has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I wish to draw Deputies' attention to section 2, which some describe as being an interpretative mode of incorporation and somewhat less than full incorporation. Section 2 states:</p>
          <p eId="para_781">(1) In interpreting and applying any statutory provision or rule of law, a court shall, in so far as is possible, subject to the rules of law relating to such interpretation and application, do so in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the Convention provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">(2) This section applies to any statutory provision or rule of law in force immediately before the passing of this Act or any such provision coming into force thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">What does this mean? This seems to be derided as a pettifogging instruction, a small section of some Interpretation Act, which is of no significance. It means that every court, in considering every section of every Bill that comes before it, and every statutory instrument that comes before it, and any rule of common law, such as, for instance, the definition of murder, which is half statutory and half common law, or rules, for example, about self-incrimination or spousal compellability in criminal matters, or the rule against hearsay in civil and criminal proceedings, or any court interpreting a statute, a statutory instrument or any aspect of our common law, must interpret that section in a way which is compatible with the convention, unless it is impossible so to do, unless the provision in question would be doing violence to the section and it would effectively be amending it retrospectively to interpret it in that way. That is a far-reaching provision because it applies, in case people forget this, even to the Courts Acts. It also applies to the rules of court which are statutory instruments. It applies in a fundamental and radical way such that our courts from the day that this Bill becomes law will be obliged by section 2 to interpret every aspect of law prior to today, and forward from today, in a manner compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights unless it would do violence to the judge's oath under the Constitution not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Those two sections are a radical import. A point that seems to have escaped many commentators is that already all such laws, common law, statute law and statutory instrument, must be interpreted by reference to our Constitution and it is the solemn duty of every judge to interpret, in so far as he or she can, any such rule of law, common law, statute law or statutory instrument in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. That is a pre-existing and superior duty and canon of construction and interpretation.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">So what does this Bill do? It says that, in addition to the constitutional mode of construction, canon and rule, if there is some other provision of our law which is open to two interpretations, even having regard to the Constitution, it should be interpreted in a way compatible with the convention, rather than in a way that is incompatible with the convention. I mention that point solely because the great majority of convention rights, if not all of them, are fully protected by the Constitution. Whereas people may argue that the freedom of speech provision of the convention seems to be a more ample protection than the Constitution permits or seems to authorise, lawyers are hard pressed to see any proposition which is consistent with the Constitution and inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">There have been occasions – since 1953 less than ten occasions – when the Irish courts have failed to vindicate a person's rights to the extent required by the European Convention on Human Rights while applying the Irish Constitution. There have been ten occasions or thereabouts in 50 years in which Ireland has been found to fall short of the guarantees of the convention. This compares dramatically with other jurisdictions in Europe where the figure runs, in some cases, to hundreds of occasions and in countries which would regard themselves as bastions of human rights protection it runs to many tens of occasions. Ireland's system of protection of human rights has been better than any comparable system under the convention because of our constitutional arrangements. Therefore, when we are looking at some species of case that falls outside the protection of the Irish Constitution but does fall to be protected by the European Convention on Human Rights it must be, in my experience as a lawyer at any rate, a narrow area of human rights protection because all of the major aspects of human rights recognised and protected by the European Convention on Human Rights are either explicitly acknowledged in the Constitution or have been the subject of unenumerated rights jurisprudence by our High Court and Supreme Court in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Regarding the aspect of the argument that is being made for a different system of incorporation, I stress that we are not here dealing with a swathe of human rights law that is being left unincorporated into Irish law. Those who criticise what we are doing should have regard to the following proposition: they must identify first some area of human rights law where the Constitution is inadequate or silent and where there is no possibility of development of the Constitution to protect that area. They must then say that that should be protected henceforth by the European Convention on Human Rights directly because the Constitution is silent in the area. I am not willing to take that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Reference has been made to a declaration of incompatibility. I said in the committee, and I do so again in the House, that such a declaration will only arise where a citizen has challenged a rule of law, either of common law or, as generally understood, the contents of a statute or statutory instrument, first by reference to principles of ordinary construction, second by reference to the principle of constitutional construction and third by reference to its being repugnant to the Constitution, failing at every level, including the High Court and the Supreme Court, to establish its repugnance to the Constitution, those courts having declared it fully consistent with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The courts are now being bested with the jurisdiction to say of such a claim that, notwithstanding the rule being fully consistent with the Constitution, it is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Irish courts are being given jurisdiction to inform the public, and particularly this House, that the law as it stands,  while clearly constitutional, is nonetheless incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The following set of sequences then comes into play. First, the Attorney General will be notified. Second, he will notify this House of the situation and it will then be for it to examine the provision and decide, exercising its sovereign power under the Constitution, if it wishes to retain the law, notwithstanding the judgment of the court because it is constitutional and the people's representatives here wish it to remain, or, alternatively, to amend it and make it compatible with the convention in whatever way the Legislature chooses.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">At that point, the House is put on notice that the law that it has put in place, despite having told the courts that they must interpret it in a manner compatible with the convention, cannot be so interpreted, and remains consistent with the Constitution without being consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights. Under those circumstances, the courts, under this scheme, would send the legislation straight back to this House and ask it what it proposed to do about it. The obvious answer is, if this House is of a mind to amend the law, to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">People have argued that it should somehow be possible for such a declaration to invalidate the law. That is not possible because by the time such a declaration has been made, the court will have found, first, that it is a law that must be interpreted in the way that it has decided and, second, that it is fully compatible with the Constitution. The notion that, at that stage, the Irish courts can somehow be told that something fully compatible with the Constitution can nonetheless be annulled by the courts, set aside or suspended because it is at variance with a decision in Strasbourg is unconstitutional as things stand and surrenders to Strasbourg the decision on what we do with any provision in our law.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Under those circumstances two questions arise, does this Legislature choose to act and what about someone who has suffered damage by being the victim of the application of a law found perfectly constitutional by the Supreme Court? If we said that such persons could claim damages as of right, it would mean that it was open to the courts to punish the State for enacting laws perfectly compatible with its Constitution and award compensation to people whose rights had not been infringed under the Constitution or as a result of the enactment of a law. I repeat that that is unconstitutional. It is not possible for this House to say that the State can be punished for doing things which it is entitled to do under the Constitution by being ordered to compensate people who as a matter of Irish constitutional law have been dealt with perfectly legally.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">That is the reason the sum of money which the Attorney General would assess under the scheme is expressed as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. He is required to advise the Government that if the person goes to Strasbourg, he or she will be  entitled to a certain sum as compensation. When this Bill becomes law, it will state that people do not have to go to Strasbourg because the State will give them the same amount as they would get if they went there. However, we can never cut out the right to go to Strasbourg, and someone might want to get a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights in preference, for instance, to the Irish Supreme Court's interpretation of what the convention requires. We can never cut out the right of application to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to seek a declaration in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">What we can do, however, is say that even where the Supreme Court has examined a matter in the most solemn fashion and declared it compatible with the Constitution, there is a mechanism whereby someone who has lost a case as a consequence can be the subject of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in lieu of entitlement to compensation so that he or she need not go to Strasbourg unless wishing to do so to secure a declaration from the court there. People are entitled to go to Strasbourg. I can never cut off their line of application to the court there – my doing so would be wrong and in violation of the Strasbourg Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">However, they now have available to them domestically the following rights. If any Irish body established under law treats them in a manner inconsistent with the convention, they can sue it for damages under Irish law since there is a statutory duty on State organs to behave in a manner compatible with the convention. If any law still infringes their rights, they have the right to have an Irish court give it a meaning compatible with the convention, unless that is impossible, having regard to our rules of construction, including the clear meaning of the statute. If they go to court and establish that the legal provision, rule of law, statute or whatever it may be is compatible with the Constitution but for some reason not with the convention, they can have a solemn declaration from the highest court in the land laid before their own Parliament and a system of <i>ex gratia</i> compensation from the State without in any way interfering with their right to go to Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">It is important to say that this goes further than that which the United Kingdom offers its citizens, to the utmost limits of what the Constitution allows me without proposing in this House an amendment to it so as to allow compensation as of right or an annulment by the Supreme Court of an Irish law by reference to Strasbourg decisions. I go the whole way, to the very limit. I have not stood back from the system to the tiniest extent. I have taken every step available to me, but still I am confronted by people who say that it is not enough, asking me to state that the European convention should have the force of law in the State. I have told the House before – I will not repeat it now – why that is impossible. It is as if one attempted to say that every past Irish law was hereby amended to make it compatible with the European Convention on Human  Rights. If we were to say that, nobody would know the state of play in regard to any court's decision on Irish law. If it did have the force of law, it would be for the District Court, Circuit Court or High Court to state that the law may appear to say that but, in fact, it was subsequently amended by the version of this legislation introduced by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">That would mean that one would wake up one morning to read in one's <i>The Irish Times</i> or <i>Irish Independent</i> that Strasbourg had handed down a decision of one kind or another. It would be found that a case already before the Circuit Court was stopped in its tracks because the judge would say that he or she read in that day's newspapers that the Strasbourg convention had been interpreted authoritatively to mean X, and the plaintiff's or defendant's case would collapse because the law had changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">A very important point, which nobody seems to remember, relates to the margin of appreciation. The Strasbourg convention was not designed to be a constitution for the member states or to have the exact same result in every member state. It is part of the jurisprudence of Strasbourg that two different states can in certain areas – not on fundamental matters such as torture and the right to self-incrimination and the like but in areas such as privacy and media rights – strike a balance which is, in the judgment of the legislature of those countries, correct for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">For example, the same outcome need not emerge for both Greece and Ireland. I gave the example on Committee Stage that it is entirely possible for the Irish Government to strike a privacy law which would prevent paparazzi taking telephoto pictures of Irish people on beaches in certain circumstances while the Italian Parliament might decide that the rights of the media in Italy made that perfectly legitimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">No uniform rule comes down from Strasbourg. A discretion in that type of area, known as the margin of appreciation, is conferred on member states and their peoples to decide the law as they so wish and to strike a balance, within broad parameters.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">If we were to say that all Irish law is hereby amended to be consistent with the convention, we would effectively give to the Irish courts the margin of appreciation. If the courts say that the law relating to privacy and media rights is hereby amended in a way which is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, we would still be left in an area where it would be possible in some cases for the balance to be struck one way or another. However, we would have collectively handed that discretion in regard to the margin of appreciation to the Judiciary, telling it to make up its mind where the balance lies and not to ask us, as legislators, to take responsibility for it. That is neither right nor proper in the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_804">—it is important that I put on the record my reasoning as to why we are proceeding this way. It is the most we can do under the Constitution and it is full-blooded.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the Belfast Agreement. The Irish Government undertook to have at least an equal protection of human rights south of the Border to that in the North, and we have that. The Deputy should remember that whatever Westminster says, the law north of Border is the law there notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights Act. Our Legislature operates on a different basis in that it must uphold the Constitution. Therefore, every Irish citizen, by definition, has a higher degree of protection south of the Border than that which obtains in the North. Our Parliament is not sovereign, the people are – through the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">We have a system which is compatible with the United Kingdom approach to European Convention on Human Rights matters and with the laws it has put in place, but we go further than the UK in section 3 of this Bill. In those circumstances, the Irish State is not simply complying to the minimum with the Good Friday Agreement but to the maximum. We are delivering in full measure, almost to the point of overflowing, on our obligations under the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Lawyers operating north or south of the Border, from the day when this is made law, will understand that the two systems are very similar in some respects but that the Irish system, not only because of the constitutional guarantees but also because of section 3 of this Bill and the right of action vested in every person in Ireland to sue public organs for failure to deal with them in accordance with the terms of the convention, contains much stronger rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I make no apology for saying to those Members who with good nature and well-reasoned, although incorrect, arguments criticise this Bill for not being what they call a direct incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights that I do not accept the validity of such arguments. As many of the other amendments which flow from this are, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe pointed out, out-workings of this fundamental difference of principle and approach, it was worthwhile having this debate at the outset of the discussion, although I am not denying Deputy O'Keeffe the right of reply. Otherwise, we might find that we had lost our audience, in so far as we have one – one never knows in this place, in bickering about minutiae and coming to the point of principle well into the debate on the amendments to this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">I hope I have made my position clear. I thank the Deputy for the amendment but regret I cannot accept it.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_815">It is exemplified by the reference to the "foreign court in Strasbourg". We signed this convention some 50 years ago and support its provisions. Dismissing the court in Strasbourg as if it was something from Mars with which we would have nothing to do outlines exactly the Minister's approach. I will come back to that in my closing remarks. The Minister covered a lot of ground but there was one area he did not cover very effectively. Perhaps, in the two-minute intervention which he is allowed under the rules, he might deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I said in my opening remarks that, having looked at all the angles, my real objection to his approach is the lack of effective remedy. One of the basic principles of our constitutional law is that where there is a right, there should be a remedy. That does not exist in the context of the Minister's Bill. However the Minister may argue in regard to damages, which we will come to later, what is the position regarding remedies other than damages? The Minister, with respect, has not dealt with that. We talked in committee about injunctions etc. – the Minister may have a response on that issue – which I thought would be covered by way of amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">However, what is the position of somebody convicted of an offence who is in gaol? Can that person get a release under the Minister's approach? What is the position in respect of somebody with a conviction who goes to Strasbourg and gets a declaration of incompatibility? Does that conviction stand? These are the issues that have not been covered by the Minister and are not covered in the Bill. That is the core weakness in the ministerial approach. I ask him to deal with that aspect before I conclude on the amendment when I will deal with the other issues as well.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_818">The Minister has given a strong defence of his position and the Ceann Comhairle was very tolerant because the Minister made a Second Stage speech two or three times. I ask the Minister to depart for a moment from his love affair with the Constitution and his hate affair with the European Union. If we were to directly incorporate the legislation into domestic law – we constantly incorporate international conventions, European Union directives, etc. into domestic law – and an incompatibility were to arise or the norms of the canons of the Constitution were to conflict with some provision in the Convention on Human Rights, what is the problem in dealing with that? We can still go through the procedures of dealing with it and providing a suitable remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Why must we take this interpretative, conditional approach rather than accepting the fullness of the convention and incorporating it into domestic law? I do not understand that. We could have done it in a straightforward fashion and in accordance with best practice. The way we are doing it here is a sort of sleight of hand, with the Minister arguing for it under the pretence of the superiority of the Constitution, which nobody denies. The Constitution is the body of rights that only the people can change. It will always have superiority but that does not stop us from incorporating the Convention on Human Rights into domestic law and dealing with any problems that arise such as a conflict between the various norms of the Constitution and the convention.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_820">The remedy to the constitutional position of the Six Counties or the northern statelet would be direct incorporation into this State. That might solve many problems. The point I made about the Assembly is that it is explicitly prohibited from passing any legislation which is contrary to the convention. That is the position we must take. We also need to take the position of direct incorporation so that when Acts or directives from this Parliament are found by the courts to be incompatible, they can be struck down and discretion will not be left with the Government to decide what to do in such an event. The legislation could continue in operation after a court finding that it was incompatible. Certain rights are more comprehensively protected under the Constitution, which is to be welcomed because a society which has the maximum amount of rights protection is a healthy one. That is what we should strive to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Direct incorporation is not contrary to our Constitution. If we went ahead with the method of incorporation suggested by the Opposition, the Constitution would remain the highest law in the land because individuals would be empowered to have their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights vindicated at a national level and a full range of remedies at the courts' disposal presented to them. The current method is minimalist and I will give examples of that when I deal later with some of the other amendments.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_822">First, when I use the term "foreign" I am using it in contradistinction to "domestic". I welcome all the decisions Strasbourg has made about Ireland. I welcome the Norris decision and the decision in Heaney and McGuinness. I am not in any way resentful of any decision ever made by Strasbourg about Ireland.  Had Deputy O'Keeffe or I been a member of the Supreme Court, I hope we would have done Senator Norris proud in his action at the time without the necessity of his having to go to Strasbourg but we were not and other people were, and that is the way our system works.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Second, in relation to criminal matters – doubtless we will have another opportunity later in the Bill to consider that – somebody who is convicted and in an Irish prison will have had the opportunity to challenge the validity of that law by reference to the Irish Constitution. They will have had the entitlement to have the law by which they were jailed interpreted in a manner consistent with the convention. It is only in the circumstance where somebody says that this criminal law is inconsistent with the convention but the Irish courts say it is fully consistent with the Irish Constitution, which I believe is extremely theoretical and unlikely to occur in practice – Heaney and McGuinness is a rare example of that, that any difficulty would arise. In those circumstances, in a sovereign State we have to decide what to do in these circumstances. Do we amend our law and keep these people in prison or change our law and release them? If they are to be released, they can be released with a pardon. We can expunge their guilt by a President's pardon, which was a matter of discussion at an earlier stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Deputy Ó Snodaigh spoke about full incorporation in Northern Ireland because the statute establishing the Assembly requires it to operate in accordance with the convention. I appreciate that but the very word he used –"statelet"– is the answer to his problem. The Assembly is required to do that because the Act of Westminster says it must. We are in a different position. We are free to do whatever we want to do under the Constitution and we can never surrender that popular sovereignty. Under the Constitution, the sole and exclusive right for making laws in this State is vested in the Oireachtas, and nowhere else, and the only courts that can strike down Irish laws are the High Court and the Supreme Court and only by reference to the terms of the Irish Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">The core issue here is the incorporation of the convention into our domestic law. That is where the fundamental difference arises between the Minister's approach and that of the Opposition. We argued this at length in committee and for me it boils down to the question of the right to an effective remedy. I am not satisfied with the Minister's response on this because I do not understand how we can regard as an effective remedy a situation where, in regard to damages, we have <i>ex gratia</i> payments at the discretion of a Govern ment and, in regard to those who may have been convicted of criminal offences, the possibility that they might be released, again at the discretion of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Article 13 of the convention is clear on the question of a right to an effective remedy. It states that everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority—</p>

          <p eId="para_831">There are other aspects of UK legislation which I do not regard as perfect either. I have a contribution to make on Irish legislation, which is what we are dealing with here. We are not in any way providing for effective remedies as laid down in the convention. From that point of view, there is a basic, inherent flaw in the Minister's approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">I turn to some of the points raised by the Minister. How important is it to have an effective remedy at national level? The Minister is correct that the number of Irish cases brought before the European Court of Human Rights has not been significant. However, our faith in the convention has been vindicated by those cases which were upheld in the court. With the accession of the central and eastern European countries to the Council of Europe, the volume of cases is enormous. I understand 35,000 cases were brought before the court last year, which is all the more reason to strengthen our focus on having convention rights upheld and remedies given at domestic level. This was highlighted time and again in a review of the courts system chaired by the Irish ambassador to the Council of Europe, Mr. Harman. The review also stressed that we need to deal with matters at national level, one of the reasons the Minister's approach to addressing this issue is entirely unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">While I do not pretend to be an expert in this area, I have listened and spoken to people, all of whom have taken a contrary position to the Minister, whose own colleagues on the Bar Council have stressed in writing their "strong preference for the legislative incorporation of the Convention into domestic law in substitution for the minimalist approach adopted in the present Bill."  The Opposition parties which have been using the expression "minimalist approach" did not dream it up, it was used by the Minister's colleagues.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">The statement emanated from the Bar Council. Every barrister appears to be out of step with the exception of the Minister, whose colleagues state: "This requires not simply that the detailed provisions of the Bill as initiated be amended in a piecemeal fashion, but that as a matter of Irish law the Convention be placed in a superior position to ordinary laws subject only to the Constitution, and that it be capable of direct enforcement by means of all appropriate judicial remedies before the Irish Courts."  Essentially, the range of amendments which I and my colleagues have tabled are designed to achieve this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The Minister highlighted what he considers to be the awful impact of direct incorporation of the convention. It has not caused problems in other countries. As I understand international law, there are two approaches to incorporation, the direct one known as the monist approach and the dualist approach. We are in the latter category as we have decided on the manner in which we want to incorporate the convention. The kind of approach we oppose has been adopted in many other countries, including Germany and Italy which appear to offer appropriate comparisons from our perspective.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">They addressed the question of how incorporation would affect prior and subsequent legislation. With all due respect to the Minister, this matter can also be addressed here. Even the basic rules of jurisprudence would cover it in that later law has precedence in the case of conflict. This rule applies to all laws passed here. The basic law of jurisprudence would also cover the direct incorporation of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">In relation to future legislation, conflicts are likely to be rare and Members of the Oireachtas and the Attorney General would be aware that we had adopted the convention. In addition, a statement of compatibility is to be included in legislation. Even if something slipped through, I believe the courts would bend over backwards to reconcile it and lower courts would refer the matter to a higher court. I do not foresee problems arising in relation to future legislation either, which brings us back to the question of the kind of approach we want. Do we want a rights based approach, as some people have been urging, or one based on obligation, that is, by which we must take certain minimal steps to be in com pliance with the notion of incorporation, which is what the Minister has done?</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I stated that I felt the Minister was dressing up in spurious constitutional clothes a political ideological argument. If this is the case, he is entitled to take such an approach. However, it is important to stress that it is not shared by anybody I know with few exceptions. I do not pretend to be an expert in this complex area. However, virtually everything I have heard or read on the subject has been critical of the Minister's approach. In fairness, he argues his case, as one would expect, which can be boiled down to the superiority of the Constitution, a concept which I fully accept. I see no problem in maintaining the superiority of the Constitution in the event of direct incorporation. Direct incorporation is not a problem and has not been found to be such by the Bar Council, the Law Society or the Human Rights Commission, all of which have investigated the issue in great depth, or senior judicial figures and learned colleagues of mine and of the Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_846">Mr. Justice Barrington had no problem with direct incorporation, stating: "All the other countries which have ratified the Convention . . . .  have now incorporated the Convention into their domestic law so that people who want to vindicate their Convention rights can do so in their own country." He advocated a similar approach here when he stated: "The big difference would be that when the Convention is made part of domestic law, it will be accessible to the man or woman in the street and they will not have to spend a small fortune and wait for six to eight years to get a decision from Strasbourg."  I thank the Minister for raising the question of support among judges for incorporation. Mr. Justice Barrington, the judge nearest to hand, is completely in favour of and advocates the direct incorporation approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">I could quote many other people, but the Minister has already heard the relevant submissions and rejected them. We are not talking about adopting and incorporating the convention on the basis of a quasi-constitution. Our approach is clear, the adoption and direct incorporation of the convention would be subject to the Constitution. I have not the slightest doubt that this approach would stand up constitutionally. It has been advocated by so many people that I had assumed the Minister would have accepted it without question. It is not helpful to argue that the Bill is superior to the United Kingdom Bill. I am not sure that is relevant. Irish legislation is  superior in some respects and UK legislation is superior in other respects. We can discuss that when we discuss the detail of the Bill. The relevant point is that we should look for best practice. All the advice is that best practice will arise from direct incorporation.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">We are pushing our case against a locked door. The arguments have been made and the logical views have been presented. There are none so deaf as those who will not hear, although I do not wish the Minister any harm. The Minister has presented a closed ear to everyone who has a view on this issue. He is adopting the wrong approach, although perhaps that is the wrong way to put it. I accept it is an improvement on the  present situation and I want to see incorporation. However, this is not incorporation. The Long Title of the Bill highlights that in that it gives further effect, as the Minister said. He accepts it is not an incorporation of the convention. If the Minister persists in that approach, as he suggests he will, we will not directly incorporate the convention. That will have to wait for another day. The Minister referred to the "O'Keeffe" Bill. Perhaps 2006 will be the time to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I do not think the Minister will accept my amendment, but my colleagues and I felt it was important to put the arguments on the record. On that basis, I will press the amendment to a vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">I hoped, had we won the vote, that these amendments would be consequential on the change to direct incorporation but I will not reopen that argument. I wish to focus on the exclusion of the courts from the present definition of "organ of State". This is an important issue that needs to be clarified. Under the definitions section, an "organ of State" includes a tribunal or any other body, other than the President or the Oireachtas or either House of the Oireachtas, a committee or a court.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">During the discussion on amendment No. 1, a comparison was made between Irish legislation and the UK equivalent but the Minister did not focus on that issue. The UK legislation is stronger. The definition excludes the courts specifically on the basis that the courts have a duty to uphold the Constitution and the law and their specific inclusion would add nothing to that position. A number of experts strongly disagree, including representatives of the Law Society. They feel it is important that the courts should be specifically defined as an "organ of State" and convention responsibilities would follow from there. They point out that the experience of the UK Human Rights Act in including a court in the definition of "public authority" has much to commend it in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The inclusion of the courts does not interfere with the principle of separation of powers in the UK and I do not envisage that happening here. I am not talking about the judicial function of the judges but about convention rights such as the right to a speedy trial, a right to a decision or to clarification as to the basis of a decision. Such rights need to be looked at and would perhaps be given a focus in the context of the convention. If the Minister was satisfied that we were not interfering with the separation of powers and were including the courts in a context where the convention would only pertain to these kinds of issues, then I can very reasonably ask him to reconsider his attitude to that amendment and allow the courts to be included, as a number of eminent bodies have suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">A number of the other amendments are consequential on the core issue so I will not go into them. I will leave it to my colleagues to deal with the issues they are promoting, and we will have an opportunity to return to these later. I would be very happy if the Minister were to accept the amendment on the inclusion of the courts.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_591">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_863">I have a number of amendments included in this package presented to us. The first is amendment No. 3, "In page 2, line 25, to delete "2" and substitute "1". That is because the legislation as presented includes only a limited number of the convention provisions, Articles 2 to 14, inclusive. Article No. 1 is missing but this is an appropriate article for inclusion. It is not good enough to leave Article No. 1 out because it states very specifically in the very first line that there is "an obligation to respect human rights."  We then get a list of the rights and freedoms covered by the convention. This article, which is effectively a preamble to the following articles, is an important one and imposes an obligation to respect human rights. That obligation should be included in the Bill and I do not see why the Minister should not accept that article. So instead of starting with Article No. 2 we should start with Article No. 1. That is my first amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">My second amendment, No. 4, further extends the Articles that are included. I am seeking, after Article No. 14, to include Articles Nos. 34 and 46. These articles extend the area of essential rights. Article No. 34 provides that the court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. It is very important that we espouse the right of any person to have access to the court in Strasbourg, and under no circumstances should there be any interference with that individual right to  access the courts. That is important enough to be included in the Bill. Why should it be excluded? Why should it not be explicitly included?</p>
          <p eId="para_865">That is Article No. 34. I then go on to look at Article No. 46. I think there was a misprint in my amendment on Committee Stage. Again, this deals with an important right – to have a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights implemented so that the State would acknowledge and undertake to abide by the final judgment of the court. There is not much sense in going to the court and getting a judgment unless there is a commitment that the decision of the court will be accepted and implemented. These are eminently desirable amendments to section 1(1) and I ask the Minister to accept them.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">I go on further then in amendment No. 5 to insert a reference to Protocol No. 12 to the convention signed in Rome on 4 November 2000 so that this would also be included. We have signed that protocol but it has not yet been ratified. There is no good reason it should not be included. It refers to equal treatment and it is desirable that a guarantee of equality at European level be included and undersigned. We should include the protocol as the corpus of fundamental rights that we would accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Amendment No. 6 is in the same vein and seeks to include Protocol No. 13 to the convention concerning the abolition of the death penalty. That has been signed and ratified, I understand, and the Minister has referred to the death penalty in the Bill. Section 1(1)(<i>c</i>) refers to Protocol No. 4 to the convention done at Strasbourg in 1983. The difference with Protocol No. 13 is that it refers to the death penalty in all circumstances, and we should go that step further and subscribe to that as well. If I remember correctly I think the Minister said on Committee Stage that he did not want to incorporate any references to anti-death penalty legislation in the Bill, but as he has already done so he might as well accept the up to date protocol and subscribe to the total abolition of the death penalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">My final amendment in this package, No. 9, is undersigned by Deputy O'Keeffe and I and Deputy O'Keeffe has already spoken on it. This concerns the question of whether we include the courts as a body on which we impose a specific duty, as an organ of the State, to be cognisant of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights in all of its activities. It is important that we include the courts. In my original amendment I had included both Houses of the Oireachtas but I have omitted that from this Report Stage amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">There should be such a duty on the courts. It is not an issue of a separation of functions but of including a specific responsibility upon a public organ of the State which has a particular role in human rights and decision making. The courts should be listed in this specific fashion. I do not see why the courts should be omitted. The courts are liable to <i>obiter dicta</i> in their expressions as  much as anybody else. We have seen situations in the not too distant past where District Court judges have apologised in public for statements they made that were construed by the Equality Authority and others as being discriminatory and racist in their effect. Why should we exempt the courts? Why should the courts not be a body that has a duty of care in the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights? The courts should be included and they should not be listed as an exempted organ of State.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_870">My amendments are in a similar vein to those proposed by the other two Deputies. Amendment No. 7 is a simple amendment which should be accepted so that Protocol No. 12 and Protocol No. 13 of the convention can be listed in section one. The amendment would also give effect to subsequent protocols, with the proviso that they could be expressly excluded by regulations made by the Minister for the purpose of this definition. We would be given an opt-out clause. We should give recognition to Protocol No. 12 and Protocol No. 13, as my colleague, Deputy Costello, has proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Protocol No. 13 is the most recent on the death penalty and should be included in order to bring our legislation up to date. Protocol No. 12 is an anti-discrimination provision and it is strange that it is absent, considering that we are talking about human rights. This would be an appropriate place to give additional recognition to that protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Amendment No. 8 is slightly different from that proposed by Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello. Both the Deputies raised the question of the courts and I cannot see why the courts are excluded. I also find it strange that the Houses of the Oireachtas are excluded. The President, the Houses of the Oireachtas, a committee of either House or a joint committee of both Houses and a court are excluded from the listed organs of the State. We are obliged to perform our duties in the Houses and in society in a manner compatible with the State's obligations. We are signatories of the convention and it would show that we are serious about ensuring that this legislation will have the effect of law if all aspects of the State are covered by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Amendment No. 10 is related to amendment No. 41. These amendments will impose a duty to ensure compatability with respect to universal rights and will involve the Human Rights Commission in the process. My purpose is to ensure that, when passing all future Bills, the Houses of the Oireachtas would issue a statement to the effect that the Bill is compatible with the provisions of the convention and that the Human Rights Commission would also issue such a statement. This would ensure when we are planning and debating legislation that we have human rights foremost in our thoughts, consider the effects of legislation and ensure that it does not impinge on the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights or any human rights. The statement in question would  be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and would be there for all to see. If a statement could not be laid before the Houses the Government would be obliged to declare that such legislation would not be in the spirit of the convention and would have to explain itself.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_593">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_874">It has been suggested that the courts should be included in the term, "organ of State". If I were to accept that amendment one of the most obvious consequences would be that the provisions in relation to sections 3(1) and 3(2) would apply and people would be allowed to sue the courts in the courts in respect of court decisions. I am not interested in that and I will not go down that road. It is not a good idea. For the reasons I mentioned and to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred in his summation of what happened on Committee Stage, it is not necessary that such a step should be taken. I refer Members of the House to the provisions of section 2. Section 2 says that "in interpreting applying any statutory provision or rule of law a court shall, so far as it is possible subject to the rules of law relating to such interpretation application, do so in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention's provisions". That includes all the statutes establishing the courts and all the rules of court themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">When we are talking about a speedy trial and the like and when people are applying for adjournments which would defeat the right to a speedy trial, the court, in looking at the Courts Acts and the rules of the superior courts, in the case of the superior courts, has to look to its own rules and apply them in a way compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. It is not as if the courts are completely out of the loop in this but it would be a mistake to attempt to create a liability in damages on the part of the courts to ordinary citizens in respect of court decisions. That is a step I do not propose to take. I do not see that it is a good idea at all and it is not necessary that we should do that. It would open up a wholly unpredictable and chaotic situation. People would then start suing courts for decisions the courts had already made. The notion of <i>res judicata </i>would fly out the window since every action would give rise to a subsequent action that the decision in the first action was somehow in breach of somebody's convention rights and allow them to re-open the issue and sue the court for its own decision. I do not think that is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">I accept court delay can inflict injury on potential litigants and people affected by litigation. I am taking steps under other legislation which has been enacted and which I hope shortly to bring into operation to create a register of reserve judgments and to put in place a mechanism to ensure that judgments are not unduly delayed. The procedures of courts fall firmly within the provision of section 2 in so far as they are governed by statute or rules of court. Therefore what  is being sought here is not necessary and if it became part of the law could have all sorts of implications about which I do not like to think. In case anybody might think so, I am not being protective of the courts. I am simply trying to contain chaos and the amendment to bring the courts within this rubric would introduce chaos.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">If Deputy Ó Snodaigh's proposal were accepted, the President and the Houses of the Oireachtas could be sued for their behaviour also.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">That would open up a major can of worms and I am not anxious to go down that route. Under the Constitution, the behaviour of the President cannot be impeached. The Houses of the Oireachtas are free to legislate in accordance with the Constitution. I do not want somebody getting some kind of injunction against the Oireachtas preventing it from doing something on the basis that he or she alleges that to do so would infringe the European Convention on Human Rights. This is not a well thought through doctrine for us to adopt.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">There is a proposal that various other protocols be included. The Constitution provides that no international agreement shall form part of a domestic law of the State except where so decided by the Oireachtas. Deputy Ó Snodaigh's proposal that any other subsequent protocols to the convention, unless expressly excluded by regulations made by the Minister, should fall within the definition of the convention would in effect purport to give the Government, in signing a convention, a legal force in the State that would be inconsistent with the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Likewise the two conventions mentioned by Deputy Costello and Deputy Ó Snodaigh have not yet been ratified by the member states of the Council of Europe. They are not in operation. At some stage they may come into operation. If and when they do, we should decide whether we want to bring them into operation here. Every time we amend the law there is nothing lost by sitting down solemnly and deciding what should be the effect of the law rather than giving it to me or my successor to make a substantial change to Irish law by simply making a regulation for the purposes of the definition. That would not be good. I will not go into the constitutionality arguments, but it would probably be unconstitutional to give the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform such a broad discretion to incorporate into Irish law by the absence of making a ministerial order agreements made by other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I do not propose to accept these amendments. It is not a good idea to make every court capable of being sued on the ground that it is alleged that it has infringed somebody's rights. It would be a retrograde step to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Deputy Costello mentioned that carrier liability was an issue of some interest to him. I remind the Deputy that under European law we are  obliged to introduce carrier liability. Although I read with interest the press reports of what was said at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights yesterday, I have to operate on the basis of the legal advice available to me. The Office of the Attorney General has carefully proofed the terms of that legislation and is of the view that it is compatible with the Constitution and our international legal obligations. I would not do something other than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Deputy Ó Snodaigh has suggested that we should put into law requirements in respect of certain legislation that would be the subject of prior proofing. Under article 15.12 of the Constitution, each House of the Oireachtas is free to make its own regulations. It is perfectly open to Dáil Éireann to say that no Member shall move a Bill, whether from the Government benches or from the Opposition benches, unless he or she has carried out certain tasks in relation to that Bill. Seanad Éireann would also be perfectly free to have such a rule if it wanted. It might make Private Members' business a rather slow procedure if Members had to wander around to the Human Rights Commission for all proposed legislation. It would also have to apply to important amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Under the Constitution – and here we differ from the United Kingdom – it is incompetent for both Houses of the Oireachtas to pass a law, which forces either House of the Oireachtas to have any particular procedure within its walls. It is not competent for Dáil Éireann to pass a Bill into law, either with or without the consent of Seanad Éireann, which has the effect of tying either House as to what it does or does not do by way of procedure in relation to Bills presented before it. It is important that we have some autonomy under the Constitution to choose our own procedures. It would not be competent for the Government of the day to tell the Opposition through a law what Senators could or could not do by way of proposing Bills in the Seanad. That would be a very retrograde step. It is not open for me to do it and I cannot accept that type of amendment either. There is nothing to stop this House at any future stage bringing in a Standing Order saying that a Minister and/or Members of the House generally must go through certain proofing requirements before producing legislation. However, I wonder if that would be wise. Members might find it very troublesome and intrusive in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Government acts on the advice of the Attorney General. The Human Rights Commission is perfectly free to be of the view that any measure going through the Oireachtas is incompatible, with the Constitution, the European convention or any other measure and to express its view to that effect. The Human Rights Commission is not an authoritative decision-making body in respect of compatibility; only our courts are. In so far as Deputies are elected by the people it is up to us  to propose what we want in the Dáil. There are proposals here in the form of amendments to the Bill which I say are unconstitutional but the Ceann Comhairle's office did not say: "Sorry, we have seen your counsel's opinion and your amendments are unconstitutional so you cannot move them."  We would have a very repressive atmosphere in the House if every amendment proposed by the Opposition or every step in the legislative process was subject to a legal veto because it was in conflict with one person's view of what the law should be. Even the Attorney General gets it wrong from time to time and is told by the Supreme Court that legislation he has carefully vetted is repugnant to the Constitution. It is the courts which make that decision, not the Attorney General, though the Government is, by convention, bound by his advice in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Opposition Deputies are not bound by the Attorney General's advice and they are free to put forward what they see as being compatible with the Constitution without being told by some "Big Brother" on the Government side that their Bill is out of order because, on the Government's advice, it is incompatible with either the convention or the Constitution. We do not operate like that. The House is a democracy and even though people may find Standing Orders constraining sometimes, at least they are the rules we have made for ourselves. We cannot tell the Seanad what rules they should apply to matters like this.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_888">This is very simple. The Minister has not dealt with two very important issues. Under the Good Friday Agreement the Government committed itself to take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction: "The measures brought forward will ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland."</p>
          <p eId="para_889">There are two issues involved here. Section 22(6) of the UK Human Rights Act 1998 provides that the Act extends to Northern Ireland. Two aspects of that Act are not part of the Bill we are dealing with and they will cause difficulties in relation to our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement. Section 6 of the UK legislation provides that public authority includes courts or tribunals but his Bill specifically excludes courts. I am not talking about separation of powers and judicial acts but if the Minister is concerned about that, section 9 of the UK Act provides for a restriction on the approach that can be taken in relation to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The other issue the Minister has not dealt with arises in relation to amendment No. 47, which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_891">A Minister in charge of a Bill in either House of the Oireachtas must, before Second Reading of the Bill–</p>
          <p eId="para_892">(<i>a</i>) make a statement to the effect that in her or his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention provisions  (referred to in this section as 'a statement of compatibility'),</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I got that from the UK legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_895">There is a requirement in the UK legislation for a statement of compatibility. I foresee a situation where we will be accused because of the minimalist nature of the Minister's proposals and we will be in difficulty on both those grounds. It will be argued that in Northern Ireland the courts are included subject to the restrictions under section 9 of the UK Act and that there is also the provision regarding statements of compatibility under section 19 of the UK Act. What is the Minister's answer to those charges, as I do not doubt they will be made?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_599">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_896">Regarding the extension of the provisions to cover Protocols 12 and 13, I understand we have signed Protocol 12 but have not ratified it and that we have both signed and ratified Protocol 13. This is not a question of incorporating legislation that has not been dealt with to a considerable degree in this jurisdiction. The thrust of my amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 was to provide some structure whereby we are not limited by the existing protocols but that we look to the future and a time when the convention will have further protocols added to it. We should provide a mechanism which enables us to deal with those protocols without going back to full scale legislation. A mechanism should be built into the legislation to enable us to do so but the Minister is saying that would be unconstitutional.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">We have spent 50 years trying to get the convention on the Statute Book and we have spent two further years trying to get it through the House. It would be a shame if we had to wait for more legislation when further protocols emerge in future just because we do not have a suitable mechanism whereby we can incorporate them into the main body of legislation, as we are doing now. Does the Minister or his advisers have any suggestions as to how we could do this apart from simply saying it cannot be done? If so, then every time a new protocol is introduced we will have to introduce new legislation and go through the entire process again, irrespective of the protocols we may have signed into law already. I am looking for an enabling mechanism with those amendments to address Protocols Nos. 12 and 13 also.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Deputy O'Keeffe made a valid point regarding the Good Friday Agreement and the equivalence of implementation of human rights on all parts of the island. The UK Human Rights Act 1998, which the UK obviously introduced far earlier than we did, makes specific provisions for the courts as an organ of state. If that is the situation operating in Northern Ireland then we do not have equivalence. I am not saying the UK Act is superior to the position in our jurisdiction, as we  have the Constitution, but this is a discordant note. We have the Constitution on one hand, emphasising its superiority, and on the other hand we are curtailing the way in which the European Convention on Human Rights is being written into our domestic law. Clearly there is a discordant note in relation to our dual implementation, North and South, which was not intended in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Equivalence in the introduction of human rights was sought and the Good Friday Agreement and the Human Rights Commission all flowed from that. The Minister is putting too much emphasis on the possibility that the courts may be open to suing. We are talking about a duty to abide by the conditions of the convention imposed on all organs of State including the courts. I always thought a tribunal had a certain judicial function. As the Minister said, an organ of State is one established by law through which any of the legislative, executive or judicial powers of the State are exercised. Obviously the courts exercise the judicial powers of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The Minister should consider this important issue again. It would be valuable if we could get the equivalence in rights that was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_600">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_901">I have already stated the reasons I do not want the courts to be regarded as an organ of State. We are not in the same position as the United Kingdom. How many times do I have to say that the United Kingdom's courts are not bound by a written constitution? Its judiciary is bound by an oath to the sovereign power which is obliged to do whatever parliament says it can do. It is wholly different in the Republic in that we have courts which must uphold the Constitution and the law. Justice must be administered in those courts in accordance with the law and the law, on this occasion, requires that every statute, including the statute establishing the courts and those governing their procedure, will, when this Bill is brought into effect, be required to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the convention, so we have a slightly different situation. There is not some non-equivalence. However, I do not want to create uncertainties or to expose the courts and the legal system to a different form of action and set of remedies. We have a system at the moment and I have to be careful about experimentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">As regards the statement of compatibility, in the United Kingdom, Westminster can pass a Bill stating that half of the MPs are hereby excluded and that is the law. Westminster can say that House of Lords Members can stand on their hands when voting and that is the law. We have a different system here in that our procedure is determined by the Constitution which states that each House decides its own procedures. It is not <i>intra vires </i>for either House of the Oireachtas or for both of them to tell a House how it should conduct its business or the circumstances in which Bills may be brought forward. One is free to bring  forward a Bill as long as the rules of this House allow it and the only authority under our Constitution which can tell one that one must comply with any precondition is this House. It is different in Westminster. It can abolish half the House of Lord by pushing through a vote under the parliament Act.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_908">We have a genuine problem here. We have entered into obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, which I have quoted, and we have agreed that the measures brought forward will ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. On these two issues I understand the Minister's difficulties but the blunt fact is that measures which apply in Northern Ireland under the Human Rights Act 1998 include the courts and provide for a statement of compatibility. We are specifically excluding the courts in our legislation and are not providing for a statement of compatibility for legislation. I can see that resulting in some difficulty, particularly in relation to the all-Ireland charter of rights on which there is also agreement under the Good Friday Agreement. There could be some difficulties on both fronts but, with all due respect to the Minister, difficulties are there to be confronted and overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">If we want to ensure an equivalence of rights, let us see how we might do so in relation to the courts. How do they do it in the UK? I accept they do not have a written constitution but they are bound by constitutional rules. When including the courts, the UK had to provide for restrictions on proceedings in respect of judicial acts under section 9 of their legislation. Is that a precedent we could follow here? I highlighted what I thought were convention issues and I was not talking about judicial decisions. I accept entirely the separation of powers in that regard. The  Minister touched on one of them in relation to court delays. I am glad he is dealing with that in other ways. That is something which could be and, in a few instances, was a cause of scandal. Litigants who go to court are entitled to decisions in relation to reserved judgments within a reasonable time. The case was well made at the time that there was not sufficient administrative and other support for judges. That is a right under the convention and should be a constitutional right – it probably would be if it came to it. This issue needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">There is another issue which is perhaps a little more difficult, that is, the question of a court giving reasons for a decision. That is a little unclear under the convention and perhaps will need to be looked at again. Under the UK legislation, which applies to Northern Ireland, they did not rush in willy-nilly and include the courts. They provided for difficulties which they foresaw in relation to judicial acts and they included a separate section on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The same difficulty may arise in relation to statements of compatibility. The Minister talked about Standing Orders, Private Members' Bills and so on. The UK legislation does not apply to Private Members' Bills but puts a specific requirement on a Minister of the Crown.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">I accept that from the point of view of procedures, Standing Orders apply here. I understand the constitutional difficulties that, in general, parliamentary procedures are a matter for parliament to decide. Again, I suggest that it is a difficulty which could be overcome. I do not think requiring a Minister to make a statement of compatibility before the second reading of a Bill could be regarded as unconstitutional. It is perhaps an issue which may have to be addressed. I will go no further at this stage other than to say that when it comes to talk about the equivalence of rights in Northern Ireland as opposed to rights here, cases may be made on those two issues that the rights in Northern Ireland are more clearly expressed and that there is not that equivalence which was provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_914">The Minister did not really reply to my first two amendments, amendments Nos. 3 and 4, as to why he will not extend the provisions back to No. 1, so instead of Nos. 2 to 14, it would be Nos. 1 to No. 14 because of the obligation to respect the rights included in the convention, which is the thrust of No. 1. Obviously, that application is important and should be incorporated into the list in section 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The right to have nobody interfere with one's application and the importance of ensuring that any decision is implemented should be included as part of the provisions as well. They would be a valuable extension. I do not expect the Minister to give way on the kernel of the issue, which he  has defended strongly, but there is no reason he should not improve the list of provisions by including these important ones. Will he respond to my request to employ some mechanism that would obviate the need for us to go through the process outlined once our country had signed and ratified further protocols to the convention? The mechanism could be used to include them. If we do not provide such a mechanism, protocols we will adopt in the near future will not be added to the existing corpus. I am trying to be helpful by way of suggesting how to improve the existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">I understand the issue of the court has been dealt with sufficiently and that the Minister will not make any concessions in that respect but he could extend the variety of provisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">In page 4, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_942">2.–(1) Subject to the Constitution, the Convention provisions shall have the force of law in the State and everyone within the jurisdiction of the State shall enjoy the rights and freedoms specified therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">(2) Subject to Article 15.2.1º and 15.2.2º of the Constitution, the Minister for Foreign Affairs may, by order, amend the <i>Schedule </i>to this Act so as to include therein a provision or provisions of any Protocol to the Convention to which the State is a party.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">We have largely addressed the core approach of those who want the convention provisions to have the force of law in the State and everyone in the State to enjoy the rights and freedoms specified therein. Apart from the advices I have received from many experts and probably some non-experts, which support this approach, it seems that if we are to have a fully developed human rights approach we should give legislative status to the rights and freedoms we want, subject to the Constitution. I accept that the provisions of the Constitution are overriding, and rightly so, but if we provide for rights and privileges subject to the Constitution it becomes our legislation. That is the approach I have adopted in respect of the  amendments I have tabled. The rights become enshrined in our legislation subject to the Constitution, to be adjudicated upon by our courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">If somebody is dissatisfied with the decision on a certain right, he or she can pursue the matter in the courts, right up to the Supreme Court. He or she could go to Strasbourg, as one can do now. On the basis of direct incorporation, it would be unlikely that the court in Strasbourg would take a different view to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decision would be taken very seriously into account by the judges in Strasbourg and would be considered to be almost compelling. This is because the Supreme Court would have taken into account the Constitution and the convention provisions in arriving at its decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">What would the position be in the case of a person taking a case to Strasbourg? The advice I get is that it would not be a matter of the Strasbourg court's overruling the Supreme Court decision. Circumstances would be very much as they are now if there were direct incorporation, and liability under public international law would arise because of the decision of the Strasbourg court. So the fears we would have in such circumstances of our domestic system and Constitution being overridden by the court in Strasbourg are not sustainable. With regard to the impact of direct incorporation on prior and subsequent legislation, the earlier legislation may be found to be invalid but it is more likely that an implied repeal would arise. That applies to all legislation. The Act we pass tomorrow will or could affect prior legislation because that is the rule of law. The later law takes precedence in case of conflict. I would not envisage any such conflict because we have an Attorney General and everybody would be cognisant of the situation regarding the convention. They might say they would have wished in that situation that the focus had been on the statement of compatibility that we discussed. The focus would be on ensuring both that the legislation was not contrary to the Constitution, as applies now, but also that it was not contrary to the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">I accept that 90% at least, and maybe 95%, of our fundamental rights are already catered for under the Constitution and we are fortunate in that. We are talking about a very limited range of rights. One of these is freedom of expression: Article 10 of the convention is stronger than the provision for this in the Constitution. The constitutional review group looked at this in detail and recommended that we incorporate a new provision into our Constitution that would be based on and drawn from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I support that recommendation which was very well argued by the constitutional review group. As opposed to incorporating the entire convention, I feel our own rights are superior in most other respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I am laying down an argument that may be reopened in the future because we will look at this issue again in the context of the charter of fundamental rights, in the European context, and  in the context of the all-Ireland charter of rights. I want to lay a foundation for the argument that with direct incorporation judicial notice would be taken of decisions in Strasbourg. There is no reason to worry, as the Minister indicates, that judges will wake up every morning wondering what decision was made in Strasbourg yesterday on which they need to be up to speed. That situation would not arise. In relation to direct or indirect incorporation any decision in Strasbourg would not be determinative, it would be an issue of which judicial notice should be taken but even with direct incorporation it would not be an appeal decision and therefore would not be directly binding. These are some of the reasons the Minister could have gone for direct incorporation, as suggested by so many people, whereby we could have an approach which was rights based as opposed to almost grudgingly accepting our obligations under the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">This goes back to the earlier point which the Minister put in very flowery language, and which I noted at the time. He went "as far as he could possibly go within the constitutional limits" and, he "strained and stretched" himself. I accept that maybe the Minister strained and stretched himself because I do not think his constitutional heart can be strained or stretched too far. If he wakes up at 6 a.m. and reflects immediately not just on the Constitution but perhaps on the European convention he might see a way in which he could be more open to the convention. I am convinced it could and can be accommodated directly in our domestic law and on that basis without taking any further time I commend the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_619">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_950">This is my last time over this course and the core of the issue. We have responsibilities in international law and we have not had problems in the past incorporating international law into our domestic law. We are having a problem now incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into our domestic law. Direct incorporation is the way to do it. We would have the convention, a body of fundamental rights as part and parcel of the direct force of law but subject to the Constitution. It may fall foul of the Constitution from time to time but we accept that the Constitution is superior and if it did fall foul it would give way to the Constitution in terms of strength of jurisdiction and we would have to address that eventuality. This House has to address what happens but that is the straightforward mechanism and the responsible way of dealing with the Convention. We should be up front with it, incorporate it directly and deal with issues that arise, if they do arise, in terms of incompatibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Minister mentioned that there is scope to look at the margin of appreciation, without going into the area of complete incompatibility and as we all have agreed there is a considerable overlap between the rights conferred by the Constitution and those conferred by the convention. As Deputy O'Keeffe said Article 10 of the conven tion which refers to freedom of expression, is probably one such area: "This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers."  It is as broad as one could get and it is unlikely that it is expressed so widely in our Constitution. That is one area where the convention probably extends beyond the rights granted under the Constitution but in many areas the Constitution is superior in terms of rights as well as being superior in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">That is my contention, that we should have gone about this with open, straightforward incorporation and deal with whatever problems might arise. That would be the model for future international conventions of the United Nations, or from any other source, that we regard as part and parcel of our body of international responsibilities in the area of human rights and so on. We could proceed with that model. For the last time we ask the Minister to have a final look at the matter and see what he can do.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_953">Amendment No. 13 reads:</p>
          <p eId="para_954">In page 4, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_955">"2.–Subject to the Constitution, the Convention provisions shall have the force of law in the State and everyone within the jurisdiction of the State shall enjoy the rights and freedoms specified therein."</p>
          <p eId="para_956">We are back to the issues with which we have been struggling for a while. I reiterate my belief that there should be full incorporation into domestic law of the European convention of Human Rights. This will state that all our statute and common law must comply with the convention. If one looks at these amendments one can see that they are not saying that the convention would be superior to the Constitution, it would be subject to the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The Constitution would remain supreme as the will of the people, so that, in the unlikely event of a conflict, it would prevail. If one examines those cases which have gone to Strasbourg, one will see that they have merely extended the rights afforded under the Constitution rather than conferring new ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The method of incorporation which we on the opposition benches have suggested, about which the Law Society, the Bar Association and the Human Rights Commission agree, would mean that any statute or common law found to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights would be struck down by the courts, as is the case currently where statutes are found to be contrary to the Constitution. The Oireachtas is obliged to amend any laws found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. If that obligation conflicted with the Constitution, the latter would still remain supreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Incorporating the convention at a legislative level would not interfere with the protection afforded by the Constitution and would only serve to supplement those rights where the Constitution did not meet the standards of the convention. We must remember that, in incidences where the rights accorded by the Constitution are more extensive, more extensive scheme shall take precedence under Article 53 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court has held that countries may interpret the convention in different ways taking account of their cultural norms. That means, although two countries may interpret the convention differently, they both comply with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">The current declaration of incompatibility merely obliges the Taoiseach to lay it before the House. Where any statutory provision or rule of law is incompatible, it is allowed to continue to exist. The European Court has held that that is not an effective remedy. If the Oireachtas wishes to ignore the declaration of incompatibility completely, it can do so. The only remedy then available to the individual is to go to Strasbourg. The intention of the legislation should be to prevent or circumvent the necessity of Irish citizens having to do so. We would be able to deal with rights in our courts if there were direct incorporation allowing the Irish courts to decide whether the law as passed was incompatible with the convention. That would then require the Houses of the Oireachtas to amend it or strike it out. At the moment the legislation does not oblige the courts to strike out the legislation, and that is a failing. The rights in the convention are basic, and there is an obligation on us as legislators to conform with it. That is the background to some of the amendments we were trying to push.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">We still have the opportunity in these amendments, particularly my own, since I do not fully agree with Deputy O'Keeffe regarding the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his proposal – perhaps it should be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform – to ensure best practice. This House and the courts have the opportunity to say, not only to the citizens of this State but to the European Union, our partners in Europe and the world, that we in Ireland have the best standards of human rights protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I find it strange that there is no obligation on this House or the courts – the High Court under present legislation – when making a declaration of incompatibility to amend the law or directive in question forthwith. At the very least, if the Minister, even at this late stage, is not willing to accept the method of incorporation, I hope he will accept the need, where a declaration of incompatibility is made, for the Houses of the Oireachtas to amend the legislation in question to bring it into compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and allow the courts to proceed if necessary.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_621">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_963">I will deal with the Deputy's last point first. It is not open to this House to tell  a future House how to respond to a situation. We might as well declare that all circles are square or start repealing the law of gravity. We have no right to tell a future House of the Oireachtas what it must do in any given circumstance. As an assembly elected by the will of the people under the Constitution, we cannot tell our successors how they must respond in any scenario. While I hope the situation never arises, it could happen that a decision was made at Strasbourg to which the State would respond by denouncing the convention. However, it is our sovereign right to do that. Nobody can tell us that we must act in a certain way depending on the outcome of a decision in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Deputy O'Keeffe said there was nothing unusual about implied repeal. I agree with him. Tomorrow we could say that a rule of law, saying, for example, that only legitimate children shall be recognised, should go, as we did in the Status of Children Act 1987. Many consequential amendments flowed from the principles of law established in that Act, so implied repeal is no strange thing. The fundamental difference is where implied repeal is done on day one and on day five, under that, a tribunal not under the control of those who passed the enabling law makes a decision that effectively carries out the repeal at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">If one allows a tribunal not part of the Irish constitutional framework to hand down a decision which automatically has the effect of implied repeal in Ireland, the situation is wholly different. For instance, as far as I recall, the European Patent Convention had to get special constitutional underpinning. A court in Spain was going to hand down decisions which would affect us. We were effectively granting to a foreign tribunal – not a term I use lightly – the prospective right to decide on the validity of Irish patents. That is the difference that we face here.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Much of the huffing and puffing that went on about direct or indirect incorporation can be explained by the fact that other states have the civil law constitutional theory. I do not claim to be an expert, but in most of those states, there are three layers of legislation: the constitution; immediately below that international law; and then domestic legislation. I believe, subject to correction, that in Spain and Portugal it is a matter of their constitutions that international legal obligations come second in the legal pecking order, with domestic legislation following. In Ireland it is different, for our Constitution explicitly says that one first goes to it, then domestic law and then only international obligations to the extent that they are incorporated into domestic law. We have a fundamentally different situation from most civil law countries. Therefore, some of the things done in other countries are perfectly compatible. If France, Spain or some other civil law country enters into an international agreement, it comes in at such a level in their legal hierarchy that it has an automatic trickle down effect so that other laws must be com patible with it. We do not have that. If I was asked which is a better system, I would say that our law is better.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Deputy Costello asked whether we would have the spectacle that every time a protocol is signed into effect in Strasbourg by the requisite number of member states, we would have a separate Bill in this House. The answer is yes, and long may it be so.</p>

If they can be signed into effect in Ireland by a statutory instrument by whoever is based at my desk in St. Stephen's Green in future days, without adequate reflection in this House as to whether we want to go down that road, we cannot know the consequences. Why is this House so anxious to nobble itself in these matters, and so distrustful of its capacity to legislate promptly on them?</p>

I hope to bring it through the Seanad as quickly as I can after it passes this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">These are hugely important issues. We are not dealing with potato blight regulations but with how our society works. I do not begrudge legislative time to this, or the right to reflect. However, we spend a great deal of time in this House on wasteful antics. An hour is spent every day asking the same old questions about where this or that Bill is, instead of getting on with some of the Bills to be dealt with. Nonetheless, I accept that this is a view which only a Member sitting on this side of the House would take, and I accept that others enjoy the circus in the morning as we examine the legislative programme.  However, it is a little rich that I was castigated recently by Deputy Costello in County Kerry for doing nothing. I am trying to get so much legislation through the House that I have difficulty finding parliamentary time to deal with it.</p>

Deputy Jim O'Keeffe wondered whether it was some sort of visceral conservatism on my  part that I did not want to go the whole hog. The whole hog, as canvassed by others, creates so many difficulties that it is, in fact, undesirable. The Government with this Bill has gone as far as possible in a manner that is compatible with the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">When it suits Deputies opposite, they say I have not done here what was done in Northern Ireland. However, if I was to accept these amendments, there would be a totally different situation to the one which applies in Northern Ireland. Deputies cannot have it both ways. They cannot ask me with one breath to say that this is serious or that we are below the bar as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, while with the next breath ask me to take a radically different approach incorporated on a radically different basis, and to say that it has affected the rule of law, so that when the two human rights commissions get together, they will be dealing with chalk and cheese. I do not see any need to take that radically different approach, even if it were possible to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">It is not a matter of visceral conservatism on my part. I am trying to do my best to bring about an ambience North and South of the Border in compliance with the two different constitutional regimes that exist. If I am successful, the two regimes would be compatible and lawyers on both sides of the Border would know that they are dealing with roughly the same animal. Since both states have common law systems, the manner in which we approach the European convention should be broadly similar in both states.

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_999">A Chathaoirligh, tá mé ag iarraidh mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Callely agus leis na Teachtaí Eoin Ryan agus Michael Moynihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo anocht. Ba mhaith liom a dhearbhú go bhfuil an Rialtas dírithe ar cheist an mhí-bhuntáiste a réiteach agus is chuige sin a bunaíodh an Roinn seo. Mar atá ráite go minic agam is é bánú na tuaithe is údar le cuid mhaith de na fadhbannaí sna cathracha, le ceantair ag fás as éadain agus easpa seirbhísí iontu. Mar a léireoidh mé tá obair chuimsitheach ar bun ag an Rialtas le díriú ar na fadhbanna seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">I confirm that the Government is committed to tackling disadvantage and areas of disadvantage in a focused and sensible way. The setting up of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs signalled the clear intention of the Government to put the issue of the community and the problems of disadvantaged areas, be they on the islands or in rural and urban areas, at the heart of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Over the years various schemes were developed to tackle disadvantage, and for different reasons they were located in different Departments. My Department now has responsibility for scheme initiatives that were scattered over five Departments. The focus of the effort in relation to a large number of these programmes and schemes being allocated to one Department will, over time, bear fruit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The process of change in Government is slow and the bringing together of the different strands in one Department is only the first step. As the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, outlined, many steps have already been taken by the Department to try to bring a greater coherence to the sector. This work will continue over the coming four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">I would like to first focus on the issue of rural disadvantage. The problems of rural isolation, rural disadvantage and rural depopulation, which are all linked, are being tackled by the Government under a number of headings. This includes the introduction of the CLÁR programme and work that has been carried out interdepartmentally in relation to rural enterprise and rural infrastructure. Decentralisation, when introduced, will have a major bearing on the redevelopment of rural areas and thus reduce disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">In relation to the Gaeltacht and the islands, since 1997 there has been an unprecedented investment in both. Infrastructure projects that had been long-fingered for years are being tackled and services are being provided where none existed previously. The response of the pre vious Labour Minister in relation to the Gaeltacht was to try to do away with the Gaeltacht housing repair grants that mainly assist poor families in the Gaeltacht and the elimination of infrastructure work on roads under scéim na mbóithre áise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Deputy Brian O'Shea yesterday referred to CLÁR, and I thank him for his kindness regarding same. The Deputy also referred to the reduction in the allocation for CLÁR this year. Obviously I regret this reduction but see it in the context of the wider budgetary pressures facing the Government. However, I assure the Deputy that because of matching funds this year and the fact that not all expenditure was matched last year, this year's programme will equal that of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">I would like to address the issues of urban disadvantage and the RAPID programme. I want to make absolutely clear at the outset that RAPID was never meant to be a self-funded programme but was designed as a reprioritisation of spend under the social inclusion measures of the national development plan towards the areas of greatest disadvantage. I assure the House that there has been a considerable spend in these areas as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">The housing commitment alone for regeneration projects in RAPID areas amounts to €900 million. From 1999 to date, €310 million has been spent on these projects. My colleague has already outlined the issues relating to CDSPs, the drugs and youth facilities fund and so on. When the Taoiseach talked about doing sums, therefore, he was talking about the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">I would now like to deal with the issue of community employment schemes. The position is that the target figure for places on CE schemes for 2003 is 20,000, a reduction from 24,991 in 2002. FÁS has responsibility for the administration of this scheme, including the allocation of places to individual projects. FÁS prioritises projects according to the type of services provided and levels of unemployment in the area, and co-ordinates reductions so as to minimise the negative effect on groups and services most in need of community employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The priority groups include the following: CE places currently provided under the national drugs strategy action plan are ring-fenced. No reduction is being made on the number of scheme places; CE places that provide child care services as part of the process of assisting unemployed parents in accessing labour market services are ring-fenced and no reductions are being made; in addition to the above, CE schemes in RAPID areas now receive top priority in terms of maintaining places – reductions will only be made after other areas outside of RAPID have been reduced; and CE places in health-related projects are ring-fenced from reduction and have remained at a constant level since March 2002. In addition, the Department of Education and Science runs a large number of schemes specifically focused at the disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">I have admitted from the outset that there are certain elements of the RAPID process with which I am not happy. One of these is the obvious difficulty of quantifying the amount of spend in RAPID areas brought about by reprioritisation. The plans received are very varied, ranging from small, low cost actions to large-scale proposals with considerably higher cost implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">What I am endeavouring to do is to separate the small proposals, which could be dealt with at local level by the partnerships and the CDB structure, from the large proposals that have to be dealt with at central Government level. Proposals have been formulated and a plan of action agreed to progress this issue. The first step of the process is to analyse all the proposed actions in all the plans and separate them between those considered local and those that should remain the responsibility of a Department. Over the coming weeks and months discussions will take place with the AITs, partnerships and CDBs on the proposed details of this new mechanism. We will also discuss the issue with the south and east and BMW regional assemblies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The issue of the capital sports programme was raised yesterday and I would like to clarify that following discussions between my Department and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, it was agreed that the definition of "disadvantage" for the 2003 capital sports programme would be confined to RAPID, local drugs task force areas and CLÁR areas. The definition used previously was much broader. I point out also that it is up to each group to make an individual application to this programme. They are not submitted by the AITs as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">I would like to take the opportunity once again to clarify the issue in relation to the partnerships. ADM manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of my Department. The programme is delivered on the ground by 38 partnerships and 33 community groups. In 2001 and 2002, funding of £45.5 million and €47.6 million was provided to deliver the three sub-measures of the programme. The outturn of expenditure for both years was €43.2 million in 2001 and €53.6 million in 2002. The extra spend in 2002 arose when an additional €6 million was provided from savings within the Vote of my Department in December 2002 and allocated to the local development programme that year. An amount of €44.6 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department for the local development programme in 2003. This figure represents a reduction of 6% in the local development subhead over the 2002 allocated figure. Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group. I understand each group was given an allocation and the reductions ranged from 4% to 7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Some partnerships appeared to expect that they would be able to carry forward underspends of previous years. My Department, like all  Departments, operates on a cash-based accounting system, not an accruals basis and cannot, therefore, facilitate cumulative carry-overs of underspends. I am examining the position regarding unpaid valid claims for payment schemes by partnerships submitted to ADM prior to Christmas 2002 and not paid until 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">I assure Deputies who have approached this debate in a constructive manner that their suggestions and criticisms will be considered fully by me and the Minister of State in our review of schemes operated by our Department. However, there are a number of questions I must ask the Labour Party, in particular its leader, Deputy Rabbitte. The Deputy has consistently referred to a meeting I attended in Tallaght. I can confirm this was my third meeting with people from Tallaght with whom I will have further meetings in the coming years. Deputy Rabbitte arrived towards the end of the meeting, which is perfectly understandable. Despite his late arrival, he has since pontificated on what he wants to believe I said and what was discussed that night. I admit I expressed concerns about the RAPID programme, some were my own and others had been conveyed to me. I expressed these concerns before the election when rural RAPID, known as CLÁR, was being set up. I was complimented by Deputy O'Shea who described CLÁR as being no talk and all action. I agree with him and would like to ensure RAPID will be considered in a similar light.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The reasons for the success of CLÁR are largely its effective mechanisms and the decision taken by me that instead of creating numerous structures of implementation and consultation, the programme would focus on delivery on the ground. This runs contrary to the manner in which the Labour Party constantly suggests things should be done, one which would cause endless delays and frustration for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Deputy Rabbitte subsequently tabled a motion on the Adjournment and, having spoken to the motion, did not have the courtesy to remain in the House until the reply was completed. This was the first time I had seen a Deputy leave the House before a full reply to an Adjournment motion had been given.</p>

          <p eId="para_1021">Deputy Rabbitte's action shows he does not want to listen or properly inform himself. The Labour Party is aware that under the Stability and Growth Pact there are strict limits to Government borrowing. Deputy Burton has stated she would not impose increases in income taxes if she were to come to power, while Deputy Rabbitte states he would not impose university fees, even on the very rich. I  challenge these Deputies to spell out exactly how they intend raising money for their proposed expenditure. Until they do so, we can assume that all we are getting from the Labour Party is rhetoric.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Coming from the party which has given an average increase of €9.71 per annum to non-contributory old age pensioners since 1997, I have no difficulty in saying to Deputy Rabbitte, whose parties, Democratic Left and the Labour Party, when last in Government gave an average annual rise of just €2.76, that we are fully committed to tackling the issues of disadvantage. There is a lot done and a lot to do and we will do it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_652">
          <from>Mr. M. Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1023">I wish to share time with Deputy Eoin Ryan. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I wish to concentrate on the CLÁR programme, set up to channel funding into rural areas of disadvantage which had experienced population decreases of 50% or more since the foundation of the State. The programme must be welcomed on all fronts. It is probably one of the first measures taken to ensure that disadvantaged communities in rural areas are given priority funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Much has been said over the years on the decline of rural communities and the shift in their populations to large centres of population. I have observed the operation of the scheme regarding third-class roads and small sewerage and water schemes for the past 18 months. Funding has been made available in conjunction with county development boards and county councils. It is a welcome initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The Minister stated the CLÁR programme is all action and no talk. We have discussed the issue of rural development and disadvantage in rural communities for long enough. It is time to stop talking and take action. There is a vibrancy in some of the rural communities, which could, if properly harnessed and channelled, create enormous good. I am aware the Minister is working on schemes aimed at community enterprise units, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">Many rural communities have come together and built industrial units which they have then leased out to entrepreneurs and others. I hope a system will be introduced to ensure funding can be channelled in this direction, as it is easy to sell the qualities of a large market town to an industrialist or outside investor. Many young people do not regard the small villages dotted around the country, notably in the CLÁR regions, as sufficiently attractive to live in because employment is not available. Some of these rural communities are on marginal farming land. We need to ensure their survival.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I am delighted to contribute to the debate and commend the Minister and the Government for funding CLÁR regions. I hope they continue to channel funding into initiatives such as third-class roads. Local area engineers have expressed their gratitude for CLÁR funding and the hope that it  will come through again this year because the work done on these roads would not have been done for another five or six years under the five-year roads programme. In my area of north-west Cork, particularly in western Duhallow, many roads have benefited from the CLÁR programme. We hope this continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">There is no public lighting or footpaths in rural areas. The least one expects from Government is that people in the most remote townlands and areas have good roads to allow them to get in and out of their homes. I hope the CLÁR programme will continue so that this becomes possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoinRyan" eId="spk_653">
          <from>Mr. Eoin Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1029">I am delighted to speak to the motion and welcome the decision of the Labour Party to table a motion on this important issue. This country has faced many problems. Some years ago we thought we would never overcome the problem of unemployment and forced emigration, which were significant challenges. Thankfully we overcame both and now no longer have forced emigration while people can also get jobs. Although we are now experiencing a slight blip, the problem is not as pronounced and is not having the same negative effects as in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">Like unemployment many years ago, social disadvantage is a major problem. It is a complex issue which will not be sorted out in a few years, but requires a concerted effort, money and consistency over a long period. This Government and the previous one has put in place various programmes, such as the RAPID programme and CLÁR, local drugs task forces, partnership companies and the young people's facilities and services fund, to try to tackle this problem. We must welcome that because they have had a considerable effect. One of the most obvious ways to tackle social disadvantage and problems in deprived communities is to provide jobs. I am glad the economy has been able to do that. It has had a major positive effect on communities and areas of the inner city which I represent and people's lives have greatly improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">However, there is still the problem of social disadvantage. In the ongoing debate about access to third level education the Minister for Education and Science made the point about putting more money into socially disadvantaged areas. That is a good step. We must try to get more people from disadvantaged communities to further their education in third level colleges. Unfortunately, most drug addicts, particularly those who abuse heroin, left school before they were 16. The longer they can be kept in school, the better chance they have of not becoming involved in drug abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">As Minister of State, I had responsibility for some of this area. I want to speak about one scheme which has been effective and which was introduced by my predecessor at the time, the former Deputy Flood, namely, the young people's facilities and services fund. I have great commitment to that scheme because it is simple, effective and targeted. A sum of €68 million was  spent since 1998 in areas of social disadvantage. Some 350 facilities and service projects and 93 capital projects, including the building, renovating and fitting out of dedicated youth facilities, have been supported by the fund. These facilities will provide access and accommodation programmes and services to a targeted group and they account for approximately 60% of the funding allocated to date. There are youth centres in Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown where there were practically no youth facilities. Some 130 project workers and ten sports workers have been appointed and there is a wide variety of community based education prevention programmes. There is targeted intervention for particular groups, such as youth work projects, and four national drug education awareness initiatives and three national training initiatives have been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The fund should be expanded. Whoever is in government should examine this simple way of getting money into deprived areas. It was a clever idea. When I was Minister of State, I complimented the former Deputy Flood on introducing it. There is a simple way of getting money to such areas. People in these communities recognised it as a way of getting funding. Many projects are now up and running as a result of that fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The RAPID programme should be pushed as hard as possible. Some people said that only €2.2 million was allocated. However, it did not have a designated fund. People misunderstood the way it was meant to be rolled out. It was meant to prioritise projects in the national development plan. We did not want a certain amount of money. We always wanted it to give priority to facilities for the 25 most deprived communities around the country. I ask the Minister to ensure it is rolled out because these communities need and want it. They have worked hard on putting their plans together. It is great that some of those plans, particularly in my own area, are now coming through. I hope the plans will be rolled out in the other 24 areas and that the local communities will benefit from the RAPID programme, CLÁR or the other projects I mentioned to get money for deprived communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I am glad the Labour Party tabled this motion. It is a big challenge to try to tackle social disadvantage. Everyone around the country should have the same opportunities. The various programmes we have in place should be rolled out as quickly as possible to ensure that happens.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_654">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_1036">I refer to the reference in the motion to health services. This Fianna Fáil led Government's commitment to providing quality health care for all is clearly demonstrated through the record levels of funding invested in health services in recent years within a framework for growth and reform as set out in the national health strategy. This year we are investing €9.2 billion in the health service. That represents an overall increase for the service  since the Government came to power in 1997 of 162% or an additional €5.7 billion. This extra investment in recent years has brought significant results, including record levels of activity in the acute hospital system and a range of additional services provided in all the major programmes of care from which people living in disadvantaged communities benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">There are many good things happening in health. In every community there are new developments and new services. Since 1997 hospital activity is up by 23%, while waiting lists are down by 14%. The number of hospital consultants is up by 34%. Commissioning of an additional 709 acute hospital beds for public patients began in 2002, an increase in capacity of 6%. Some 520 of these beds are now in operation and the remainder will shortly come on stream. This is the first phase of the provision of 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011 as announced in the health strategy. In 2002-03, €118 million in capital and revenue funding has been allocated to increase bed capacity and to provide an additional 709 beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">It is recognised in the national health strategy that primary care has a central role to play in the delivery of health and personal social services in a modern health system and that the health needs of the majority of people should be capable of being met by primary care services. The primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, published in late 2001, sets out a model which aims to bring a wide range of service providers together in primary care teams so that integrated services can be delivered in the community in the most appropriate and accessible way. As stated in the new national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed, within resource constraints, to advancing the implementation of the primary care strategy in accordance with the action plan for the strategy. Funding totalling €8.4 million is being provided for an initial ten implementation projects in 2002 and 2003. Of these ten projects, four of the projects are located in areas of disadvantage, two in RAPID areas and two in CLÁR areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Health centres have an important role to play in terms of their central position within local communities in relation to the provision of a wide range of health and social services to local populations in both urban and rural settings. The availability of funding for health service capital needs under the national development plan since 2000 is facilitating the development of new health centres and the upgrading and refurbishment of existing health centres to meet the health needs of communities in the most appropriate environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Regrettably, disadvantaged communities bear a disproportionate share of problems related to drug misuse. Services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over recent years. Funding has been provided to regional health boards to considerably strengthen the infrastructure for the delivery of drugs services. In one area alone, the eastern region, treatment  services have expanded from 12 locations in early 1997 to the current 57 and there could have been more only for public objection to development of such services. The number of people receiving treatment has risen from 1,914 in 1997 to more than 6,800 at the end of April this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Approximately €225 million additional funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services since 1991. In 2002, a further four springboard family projects were established in RAPID priority areas of need, as discussed with the health boards. This brings the number of springboard projects to 21, with an additional eight to be established on a phased basis depending on resource allocations over the next two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The final evaluation report of the teen parents pilot initiative was positive. The existing pilot projects will be supported and continued funding will be made available. As stated in the national health strategy, a responsive health system must develop ways of engaging with individuals and the wider community to ensure services are delivered in a most responsive and accessible way. This is particularly the case in disadvantaged communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">There are many good things happening in this area and we are striving to achieve a world class health service. Time does not permit me to outline all the developments. I am particularly pleased good progress has been made in the provision of day care centres and community supports for older people.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_1046">I have listened carefully to the debate and the arguments that have been going back and forth. While the Government maintains there have been improvements, the question is whether these have been sufficient given the expectation of the public or whether services have declined for disadvantaged communities and people who live in poverty. Ireland experienced a boom period and a great deal of money was available. There was an opportunity then to harness economic prosperity, eliminate structural inequality and share the wealth, particularly among the less well off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">The Government made a choice which resulted in money following money and the gap between rich and poor widened under this Administration and its predecessor. There are more millionaires in Ireland but there are more people sleeping rough on the streets. Is that an improvement? It has never been easier to get into debt. There is more credit available but poor people are taking advantage of that. Is that an improvement? There are 50,000 people on housing waiting lists. Is it easier to buy a house? Have house prices reduced? People are making profits from housing  developments but they are not from poor backgrounds and the Government continues to reward them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I was at the launch of a report by the Simon Community recently. The Government states the number of homeless persons is reducing but those who work in this area say there are more people sleeping on the streets and the anecdotal evidence is that more people are living on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">Child care was mentioned. It was believed that the economic boom presented an opportunity for people to break out of the poverty cycle. However, the cost of child care places increased and it is also much more difficult to get a place because no extra places are coming on stream. A total of 90,000 people live in consistent poverty while 250,000 live in relative poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">I refer to the elderly. Almost 38% of pensioners live in the poorest 20% of households. Is that an improvement? One quarter of the social services budget is spent on pensions compared to 50% in other European countries, according to EUROSTAT. The Minister of State dealt with the health service. I do not know what world he is living in when he mentions improvements in the service. Every day constituents tell Members about what is happening in accident and emergency departments and elsewhere in hospitals. The Mater Hospital announced 180 job losses recently. It is more and more difficult for poor people to get into hospitals. There has been a 22% increase in the cost of monthly drug payments and a 26% increase in casualty fees. The Government promised 200,000 medical cards but, instead, 30,000 people have lost theirs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Unemployment has increased. A total of 2,194 jobs have been lost in Dublin over the past two months, including 200 in my constituency yesterday. The trend is worsening but the Government is not waking up to it. CE schemes have been cut back with the loss of 5,000 places and that will have a significant impact on disadvantaged communities where they had more than just a training role. What will replace them?</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">It is more difficult to make it to third level if one is from a disadvantaged area. More school buildings need to be refurbished and so on in these areas. Many of them do not have fully qualified teachers. With regard to transport, it is not easier to get a bus in Dublin or around the country these days and it is more difficult to get to places of employment as a result. ESB charges have increased. Policing also impacts negatively on marginalised communities. Things have not improved.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_1053">I support the motion. As an elected representative for inner city Dublin, I condemn the cutbacks in CE schemes, the jobs initiative and the social economy programmes. It is a disgrace that when such community investment is most needed, the Government should set out deliberately to undermine the great work being done by local people on these schemes.  Incredibly, while Fianna Fáil plans to spend more than €50 million on luxury jets, it is taking jobs and services away from the most disadvantaged groups in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Without CE schemes and the jobs initiative, crèches, after school projects, youth services, senior citizen groups and projects providing training and development for recovering drug users will find it extremely difficult to provide a viable service. The manner in which these cuts were introduced was worse. The way local people and community groups were treated was insulting and disrespectful following the investment of a great deal of voluntary time, energy and resources as part of what was hoped to be the regeneration of neglected and disadvantaged areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">Organisations such as the Dublin Inner City Partnership have put on record how they felt severely let down by the Government instigated cuts. The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, are the architects of this attack on marginalised people. They project a different approach at election time and when they attend launches and openings, but they are now exposed in their true light. The result of these cuts will be a loss of opportunity for people who have no other chance in life and a loss of vital services for the elderly, children and the most vulnerable groups. These cuts can only contribute more to the ever-widening gap between rich and poor in this State.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_659">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_1056">The RAPID programme was initiated in 2001 amid great fanfare with a view to regenerating and revitalising deprived urban areas. It has degenerated into a pale shadow of what the original concept envisaged. It was hawked around the country prior to last year's general election as a cure-all for deprivation in the 45 most needy urban areas. The Government shamelessly and conveniently placed hundreds of prospective RAPID projects on hold, where they have remained since. Assurances were freely given that the great €15 billion ATM would continue to be on tap for the 45 designated areas to progress social inclusion measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">We recently discovered that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is now doing a re-think on the feasibility of the entire programme, more or less suggesting that it was ill-conceived and should be remodelled. The perceived wisdom about RAPID as far as the Minister is concerned is that it has been a cumbersome, unmitigated disaster and that many hundreds of projects, all submitted in good faith, should be shelved. In other words, it should be scrapped.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The Government's grand design for tackling disadvantage in the shape of RAPID is now seen for what it really was, a cynical plot which it never had any intention of implementing. This is in character with the lack of commitment to the RAPID programme, which, after an initial injection of administrative funding, has remained fallow ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The FÁS community employment scheme has also been emasculated, with places reduced to just about 22,000 after the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment sought to reduce payments even further. These cutbacks were a brazen breach of the PPF and reneged upon its commitments. It was all part of the Government's plan to slash public spending by clawing back €15 million from schemes which make a major contribution to community development and give people an opportunity to get back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">FÁS then proceeded to redirect resources by appointing an additional nine directors at an annual salary of €62,500 each, thereby compounding an all-out assault on low income families, and single parent families in particular, which account for 22% of CE workers. The Government's waffle about social inclusion, a highly-trained workforce and sustainable development merely exists in the realms of fantasy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_660">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_1061">I support this Private Members' motion but I want to focus in particular on the decision by the Government to cut a further 5,000 community employment places by the end of the year. I will make a general comment about CE schemes. CE schemes should not just be viewed as a means of taking people off the live register and getting them back into full employment. They have an intrinsic value in themselves because for many communities CE schemes have helped to provide excellent social, economic and environmental services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The cutting of 5,000 places nationally will impact negatively on all communities but in particular on disadvantaged communities. For many communities CE schemes have become part of the fabric of the community and the proposed Government cuts will remove an essential community support. As one community worker said to me today, communities are an easy target.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">One particular community initiative I wish to mention is CLASP, the community of Lough Arrow social project, in County Sligo. I mention this project for two reasons. About six weeks ago Deputy Ó Cuív, who was in the Chamber up to now, launched this project in Sligo and spoke highly of it on the day. He said it was an ideal project for a rural area and deserved great support. This is a health-related project for elderly people, and having listened to a number of older people on the day, they described it as an excellent project that made a positive impact. It has literally turned their lives around. However, today CLASP received a letter from FÁS saying that the project would not be mainstreamed as planned and expected and that of the 11 participants of the scheme, just one will be allowed to remain on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Just think of what this means. Relationships and trust have been built up with older people over the last year. People have received training that is now wasted. Imagine the disappointment of older people, people who do not want change  at this time in their lives. Imagine the frustration of the workers and of the organising committee. Their must be greater flexibility in these schemes, otherwise we end up lurching from crisis to crisis and with committees just desperately trying to manage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Numbers on CE schemes must not be cut because if this happens the Government is simply cutting off the life blood of so many communities. There is little point in Ministers telling people how excellent their projects are, even though I know it was sincerely meant on the day, if six weeks later the rug is pulled from under them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1067">I am glad to speak on this motion and I strongly support it. Everybody knows about the good work done by FÁS. Look at every wall in Ireland and FÁS is playing a part in any good work that is done. FÁS has played its part across the board, whether it is helping schools, older people, deprived communities or vulnerable populations. This can be seen across urban and rural Ireland and to think about a cutback of 5,000 community employment places is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">There was a scheme in place in Knockmore in County Mayo which is now closed. They were building a centre which was much needed by the community but it has now been put in jeopardy by the removal of the community employment aspect. I demand that this be restored in the interests of equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">Across the board we see the situation in our hospitals. The Minister spoke about the injection of funds into health but I do not know if he is aware of what is happening in our hospitals. In Mayo General Hospital every night there are at least eight people waiting on trolleys for beds that are not there. Meanwhile upstairs there are empty wards because the funds have not been made available to allow those beds to operate. That is what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">As regards access to cancer care, people do not have local centres of excellence. People in Waterford, say, have to travel to Dublin, which costs twice as much at least. Those centres of excellence are being denied to cancer patients also because bed numbers are being reduced. There are reductions in the numbers of beds even though the numbers are not even adequate at the moment to cater for demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">What kind of system is this? What kind of Government is this that is not providing enough funds to run a basic service? As far as I am concerned it is about people. If it is not about people what the hell is it about? What are we doing here? I cannot understand how a Government could put party before people. Whatever money is necessary to allow the system to work should be put in. People talk about reform but while we  are waiting for all this reform we need to think about keeping the services going. Older people know that one's health is one's wealth and if we do not have the health services we need then where are we at the end of the day?</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">I strongly support this motion. We need infrastructure in rural Ireland. We need CLÁR programmes. CLÁR has been helpful but it is only the tip of the iceberg. We need tax incentive schemes in Mayo to allow us to have a future. I strongly support this motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1073">If ever an acronym was more inappropriately and cruelly applied it was RAPID, which stands for revitalising areas through planning, investment and development. It held up the hope for many in disadvantaged communities that a Government would finally pay attention to their real needs and provide the means for those communities to, within their own resources, meet many of the problems that existed and continue to exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">Unfortunately RAPID seems to be one of the greatest deceits practised by the outgoing Government and continued by this Government. The reality is that there has never been a funding heading for RAPID projects. In opening the debate the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy O'Shea, listed the replies he had received to letters from various Ministers on 16 April. I asked those same questions on 10 December 2002 and not one iota has changed since.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">The Government has been trying to give the impression that money has been spent on the basis of a programme that does not exist. It is using every imaginable funding heading to give the impression that something is happening in this community when all that is happening are things that were happening anyway, some of which pre-dated the RAPID programme and some of which have not even happened yet. It is typical of a Government that is pretending that it is providing services on a national basis yet has fallen at so many fences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">Why should disadvantaged communities be any different? Why should they be different from people who have not been given the health services they have been expecting, the houses they have been expecting or the continued economic prosperity that they have been told exists, but does not seem to exist in reality?</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">I suspect the Government parties care little for community development. The Progressive Democrats register no votes at all, or very few, in the communities concerned, and Fianna Fáil has always viewed solid, real community development with distrust. This is because it believes that real community development, where people take the means of informing themselves and meeting their own needs from within their own resources, is a challenge to a party that believes it has proprietary interests on how the State is run and how institutions operate at a community level.</p>

I have experience in my constituency of two communities three miles apart that form two halves of one RAPID project. I have seen how people have worked together to create plans that define the problems and point out to the various State agencies what can be done and how it should be done if only the investment were provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Nothing has happened in the three years. All the Government has done is store up resentment that I fear will translate into non-participation in political structures when the people should take exactly the opposite road and reject those who have spun this web of deceit and given the dream of hope for improved communities that now has been so cruelly taken away. Instead they should vote for the alternatives that will put in place a proper system of real community development that they can call their own and not be frustrated and stymied by those who have been so deceitful to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1083">This morning we got a lecture from the Taoiseach about his concern for disadvantaged communities. In this Private Members' motion we are getting the reality behind the flimflam.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Deputy O'Shea outlined the key cutbacks last night: 5,000 CE places to go by the end of the year; the RAPID programme rapidly running into the sand; no money in the young people's facilities and services fund; and cuts in budgets for area partnerships and community development projects. This is part of the great slash and burn policy that began as soon as deceit and duplicity won the last general election. It is a policy that targets the most vulnerable, the poor of the developing world, those trying to access health care, students and those living in areas of social disadvantage who benefit directly from these schemes that are now being cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">Such areas are not exclusive to metropolitan Ireland. In County Wicklow even smaller towns and villages are directly affected. In Rathnew for example, the members of a community development group that worked hard to survey the needs in their local area find their project stalled completely. For them and for many others a new and barren landscape has opened up as there is now no money in the kitty for young people's facilities and services. A year ago Ministers scampered around the country dazzling people with the promise of millions in RAPID programme money. However, it turned out that the Ministers were peddling a classic three-card trick and the money that was promised has magically disap peared or is being described in a different way now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">In my home town of Bray the area partnership is now threatened with extraordinarily severe cuts. In November 2002 it was informed that there would be a 6% reduction in the 2003 budget. In March, it was informed the budget would be slashed by 30% on the available balance – a loss of €320,500 in 2003. No organisation can sustain such a loss. If this reduction goes ahead many valuable local projects will be severely affected. These include: basic adult education programmes; literacy schemes; education activities for children like homework clubs and breakfast clubs; enterprise ventures; social economy projects; and community development initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">When I raised my concern at the Bray Town Council meeting about these cutbacks it was rubbished by a phalanx of Fianna Fáil councillors. It was worth noting their venomous defence of the indefensible. In the case of the Ballywaltrim community centre the case for funding is unquestionable. A new community centre is planned to replace the substandard, rat-infested, decrepit Nissen hut that until recently provided the only community centre for this part of Bray. The council has provided more than €300,000 and the local community has raised €35,000. However apart from a tourism grant, the Government has not provided any social disadvantage funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">The Taoiseach talks to us about social inclusion. However, he is silent as 30,000 more people lose their medical cards, hundreds of people sleep rough on our streets and the community supports upon which those living in poverty depend are being steadily whittled away by his Government, his policies and his hypocrisy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1089">Rumour has it that the Department run by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is known either fondly or otherwise as "Craggy Island" in addition to being called the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I would like to ask the Taoiseach what is going on in that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">In recent times in my constituency of Dublin West, I have attended no less than three launches under the RAPID programme of needs analysis studies in relation to large areas of local authority housing. People from the area were asked to participate in a study, which involved going out and asking members of the community what they would like to see in their area. The resulting glossy reports, usually featuring photographs of the Fianna Fáil Minister involved, point to communities desperate to see gardaí on the beat and to see more resources put into education so that their young people can both attend nursery school and stay on at school to finish their leaving certificate, never mind go on to third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">During the referendum on the Nice treaty, the Taoiseach used the word "dingbat" rather freely. It is as good a word as any to describe the Minister's actions in the Department of Community,  Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Among those now working in disadvantaged communities, including community development programmes, partnerships, Leader programmes, drugs task forces and the plethora of other bodies that exist, there is a growing bewilderment and frustration as to what exactly is going on. Communities had their expectations significantly raised in the run-up to the last general election by the creation of special initiatives such as RAPID. In essence the Government provided a limited amount of money for the appointment of co-ordinators and the generation of vast amounts of consulting reports and papers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">For the most part, the requests put forward by the community in such reports are utterly predictable and are an indictment of the dismal failure of Fianna Fáil in office to inject real resources into disadvantaged communities. Given the appalling state of policing and local authority services in large housing estates in all our big cities, the notion that people in Fianna Fáil, such as the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, have wrapped the flag of social justice around Fianna Fáil is something of a sick joke. As a consequence of the promises made by Fianna Fáil Ministers in these glossy reports, there is now a growing sense of despondency and frustration within communities. Money that was meant to be spent on child care initiatives remains unspent. Promised resources such as the welfare education officers and National Educational Welfare Board remain undeveloped and unfounded and have never got off the ground. Children as young as nine and ten continue to drop out of school with all the inevitable consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">Throughout communities in Ireland there is fear in relation to the closure of community employment places and the reduction in community support programmes, which are keeping resource centres and information centres open in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the State. To accuse Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach of cynicism in relation to disadvantaged communities in this country is an understatement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, have been responsible for allowing a large number of agencies, boards, projects, partnerships, advisory groups, contract groups and drugs task forces to mushroom in every district and area. Clearly the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is of a mind to substantially reduce this elaborate edifice, now that it has served its electoral purpose for Fianna Fáil. We call on the Minister to give some indication as to how he proposes to spend the money that is already lying unutilised and the money that was promised during the election for disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The key issue here is to give communities the confidence that their community resource centres will stay open and that the initiatives created to encourage young people to stay in school and to encourage older people to avail of second chance education will continue to operate and grow. We  have had a rather synthetic debate in recent weeks about access to third level education. In wrapping the flag of social justice around himself, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has stated that his concern is to encourage students from disadvantaged backgrounds into third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">If the Minister wants to get students from poor backgrounds to go into third level education, the way to do it is to ensure, first of all, that they get a decent nursery and primary education and a decent second level education. Under Fianna Fáil's stewardship, the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds staying on to complete their leaving certificate at second level has fallen. That is a disgrace. Niamh Bhreathnach, when Minister for Education, consistently raised the level of completions of the leaving certificate. While Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in office it has consistently fallen. That is the real legacy of Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1097">In his contribution to this debate, the Minister of State at the Department of the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, regaled us with a long litany of achievements and successes in his area of responsibility. I would like to invite the Minister of State to visit my constituency to see, at first hand, some of the consequences of those achievements, or of the lack of them. He will be able to meet the discontented and unhappy CE workers who are being told, almost on a daily basis, that their schemes are under threat. They are being cut severely and, in some cases, closed down completely. In the Crumlin, Drimnagh, Bluebell and Walkinstown areas cuts of up to 31.5% have been announced. Four schemes are to be removed completely. CE schemes have provided a lifeline for many people who had been excluded from the workforce for many years. More importantly, they provided people with dignity, a sense of purpose and, in many cases, an opportunity for retraining and re-education. Now, the carpet has been pulled from under their feet. In addition to the cost to the individual, many of these schemes were providing a valuable community service and this will also disappear. Again, the people who will be most hurt are the most vulnerable, most at risk and most disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The Minister referred to the need to co-ordinate some schemes and to mainstream those that worked. I agree with him. I would have no difficulty in looking at mainstreaming those schemes that were successful, but slashing the schemes that work or failing to introduce schemes that would address the issue of social disadvantage is a completely different matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Whatever happened to the educational welfare board? Why is the board not up and running and functioning properly and why, when we were promised 300 officers are only 23 available? There is no area to which more lip service is paid than to education and its value. Every time we  want to find a method for dispensing with social exclusion we latch on to the importance of education, and rightly so. We refer to education as the vehicle for breaking the poverty trap, we see it as a lifeline for those who are marginalised but what is the response to those who are most excluded, most at risk and most likely to drop out of the education system? There is a token educational welfare board boasting a mere 8% of the promised quota. There is no plan to address the enormous problem of non-school attendance for those who most need to be in school every day. There is no commitment to addressing the major problem of early school leaving. In my own constituency this is a major problem with young children of nine and ten who are not attending primary school and there is no one to address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">Where do the elderly fit into the scheme of things? They are ensconced as virtual prisoners in their own homes or flats, afraid to go out and walk the streets because of the lack of policing and the risk of security for them. They are afraid to answer the doorbell because they are afraid they will be mugged, they are watching their pension increase being eroded before they have a chance to get their hands on it and they are waiting, in many cases, for up to two years to have a shower or a ramp installed. If that is not social exclusion what is? It is also depriving these people of their independence, their confidence and their dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The public were fed a concentrated diet of promises in the lead-in to the election and it is all too obvious that it was no more than hot air.</p>

          <p eId="para_1102">I thank the members of the Labour Party for sharing their time with me and I compliment the party on putting down this important motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">It is amazing that when cutbacks come our way and the economic situation gets tough, it is the weak who suffer. I am not surprised that this is the case in this PD-led Government. The Progressive Democrats have no time for, or interest in, people from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">We see where the main cutbacks have occurred. Cutbacks in CE schemes hurt the weak and people who are most marginalised. We were promised a disabilities Bill and other measures to deal with disabilities but the cutbacks have hurt people with disabilities more than most and the Progressive Democrats do not care. The Minister of State with responsibility for that area, Deputy Parlon, is doing nothing about it. We were promised that CE schemes in the health area would be mainstreamed but there is no funding for that this year and no plans to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is now known as the Minister for Craggy Island. I was glad to hear him say he is going to look at the claims for partnerships and ADMs made prior to Christmas 2002 which were not paid until this year. That is important and I  urge him to do that. It is a crucial issue and is a cause of hardship in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">Decentralisation was mentioned. I will believe it when I see it. I am sure it will be politically motivated when and if it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">The Government has no youth policy. The Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are all responsible for youth policy. I am concerned about young people and public order offences. This occurs in areas of disadvantage more than most. The National Crime Council recently issued a report which recommended that steps be taken to improve and extend the range and variety of youth services so that young people can meet and engage in age-appropriate leisure activities. Very little is happening in this area. There is no co-ordination and no policy. A Youth Work Bill was published but no money is available for implementation. The Joint Committee on Education and Science recently discussed this issue and was told that the minimum resources necessary for the vocational education committees to take part in this must be put in place but that no money is available. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, fair play to her, is trying to get money but nothing is being made available. The IVEA and the chief executive officers' association have also been looking for action in this area but they have been told it is not possible to have funding in the Estimates. The people who will be hurt more than most are young people and their families throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">I call on the Minister and on the Government to bring forward a proper youth service plan, to fully implement the Youth Work Act and to provide the small amount of money necessary for youth work. We know what happened. The Government, with its focus groups, discovered the importance of the grey vote and has decided to cut young people adrift. It is going to reintroduce college fees, if it can, and is doing nothing for youth work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">I challenge the Government to put forward a proper youth plan and to let us know what it intends to do about it. Youth services are not sufficient. Barnardos is also calling for community services, youth centres and youth workers. It is time the Government did something about this instead of paying lip service and making speeches of gobbledygook that mean nothing and show no heart or passion for the problems that exist in our society and are visited upon everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">A Progressive Democrats Minister is also responsible for the insurance industry. Insurance costs are shutting down community facilities left, right and centre and nothing has been done about it. I challenge the Minister of State to tell me one effective initiative that has been taken in the last year since the report on insurance was issued. Insurance costs are rising, employers are having to close businesses and youth facilities and other facilities such as playgrounds are closing down.  The Government has done nothing about this except issue reports, set up commissions and sit on its hands. It is time it did something about this problem. I challenge the Government on the two issues of youth work and insurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1141">—he will find that people are deeply disturbed that the work they have done in recent decades is being dismantled. There is apparently no understanding on the Government side of what is happening. People I know who live in areas classified as disadvantaged have learned much about community development. They have identified their needs and worked together to set up structures and networks; they have drawn up plans, particularly the RAPID plans, though those will not be put into effect as there is no money for them; they have campaigned for services and found out how to access funding; and they have managed schemes like the CE scheme, run programmes and educated and upskilled themselves. They are deeply disillusioned and in some ways there is disbelief at the lack of understanding of what has been going on in their communities in the past few decades and what they have achieved through using programmes and working together to develop their communities. There seems to be no understanding of the importance of what they have achieved and their work is being dismantled before their eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">These people have to put up with long-winded waffle about addressing disadvantage. There is a great deal of talk about disadvantage but people have identified the needs in their communities and their achievements are being taken apart. Funding is not being provided and progress is not being made. They have the structures in place and they know what they need, the resources to maintain that progress. However, those resources are being pulled and it is deeply destructive to turn back that progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">These communities have been particularly vocal on the value of education both for themselves and their children. Many people who had no chance of education when they were younger have grasped the opportunity of second chance education and they value the need to give their children the benefit of opportunities they did not have. The Minister for Education and Science has abused the word "disadvantage" more than anyone else because he has been talking about it since he came into office but has done nothing about it. He cut programmes which were designed to tackle disadvantage last September when the cuts in the Department of Education and Science included €3.8 million from adult education courses and €6 million from school retention schemes. The education welfare board, which Deputy Haughey and others mentioned, was not given the resources to roll out its services – in many areas there is no-one with the job of ensuring that children stay in school. The old system has gone and the new system is inadequately resourced. Schemes like Early Start and Breaking the Cycle have not been developed and those are the kinds of schemes which make a difference in schools where children need extra support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Nobody on the Government side seems to care about the reality of the schemes which will assist young people. There are some excellent schools and programmes around the country for those who do not fit into regular schools and who need special educational environments. Those schools are strapped for cash and have long waiting lists. There have been suggestions as to how the number of unqualified teachers in disadvantaged schools can be addressed but no funding has been advanced. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul had to put €2 million into disadvantage in education last year.</p>

The co-ordinator of the Loughlinstown employment group, Mary McHugh, stated in a communication to me that due to recent cuts, the scheme has been significantly affected. She said services to the community, as well as the group's ability to employ, have changed and that it could no longer take on new applicants or run the present projects sufficiently with the small amount of employees left. She went on to say that this project, for example, had suffered cuts of over 50% in the last year alone reducing its staff to fewer than 15 with one working on the community magazine and the number working on secretarial services reduced.

          <p eId="para_1158">—let me tell the Minister how to tackle educational disadvantage. One does what the community workers in Mountwood-Fitzgerald Park are doing. One takes children from disadvantaged communities and helps them with their homework. One does the practical things needed to lift them out of the educational poverty in which they find themselves. What is the Government's response? Those people need a building in which to do that. They are operating out of two old apartments in a building which is about to be demolished. For three years they have asked the Government to provide the money and the resources for a resource centre and a building in which they can do that kind of important work. All of the rhetoric we have heard over the last couple of days from Fianna Fáil about educational disadvantage will ring a lot more true when I see the approval for that building to provide the children of that area with the educational opportunities they need and deserve.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1159">I thank colleagues on all sides – in Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Independents – for supporting this motion in the names of my colleagues, Deputies O'Shea and Howlin, because it focuses on the real injustice in this society, which is, the manner in which this Government has pulled out from under various community organisations and groups which are keeping many disadvantaged communities together. It was hard to listen to the Taoiseach this morning trying to convert the reintroduction of fees for third level education into an argument about disadvantage. The record of this Government on disadvantage is plain to see: the manner in which it savaged the community employment scheme; stopped the job initiative scheme; dismantled the RAPID programme; failed to fund the drug strategy; impacted on the earnings of lone parents; and undermined the back to education allowance on which my colleague, Deputy Penrose, won a minor concession. This is the reality. If this Government was interested in disadvantage, it could have expanded and built on the Breaking the Cycle programme introduced by Niamh Breathnach and it could have put money into the Early Start programme, but it brought in a 69% increase in registration fees for every class of student, poor or rich.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1166">I was a victim of a new arrangement in the House whereby two Deputies are taken on the Adjournment whereas previously, they used to share time or were taken individually. I meant no disrespect, no more than I meant disrespect by my absence tonight. I had to attend the funeral of a woman in my constituency whose son is the editor of the <i>Tallaght Echo.</i> The Minister may have heard on radio that she was taken into Tallaght Hospital where she spent five days on a trolley. She died the morning she was moved to a bed. That is the reason I was absent tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">Having said that, I have a soft spot for the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, because I grew up with the fairytales of his late, respected grandmother who used to write them and who has an endearing role in the minds of many of us. However, what I take exception to is that in 2003, Fianna Fáil is still telling fairytales to the people and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is the best fairytale spinner in the House. He comes in here and he tries to make an argument about RAPID when it has been dismantled. What the Minister is engaged in is labelling anything that moves as RAPID. RAPID was a stunt to win the election for Fianna Fáil candidates in disadvantaged communities and the Minister knows it. The Minister's colleague, Deputy O'Connor, who was a beneficiary of it and who I am delighted to see  has a matter on the Adjournment tonight for the second night in a row, which is a bit unusual, read into the record last night the state of play on community employment in the constituency he and I share. The FÁS guide figure after the initial round of cuts after the election brought down the number to 420 in the Tallaght area. It has now got an instruction that by the end of the year, it must get the places back to 362. When I rang the labour exchange I found out that there are 7,000 people eligible for community employment in Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">The Minister came in here and tried to pretend this Government is somehow interested in disadvantage when there seems to be no appreciation of the very people in the community who have been keeping some of those disadvantaged communities going and who are responsible for second chance education, the drugs programmes, the women's groups, the arts groups and all of the community work community employment is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">There seems to be no appreciation. The Minister rambles on about CLÁR in Fettercairn, but he might as well be talking about Mars. The people there are interested in the projects they put together to comprise the plan he required them to submit under the RAPID programme. They came up with a wealth of meritorious projects and now they are told there is no funding available for them. That is the net issue and there is no point in relabelling and redesignating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">Deputy Lynch told me yesterday that a bridge is being built in Cork, which is a RAPID project. This is absolutely farcical. RAPID was a carefully chosen acronym to mislead at election time and was responsible for the election of people like my good friend, Deputy O'Connor, but it has done damn-all for disadvantage. The Minister ought to be ashamed of himself for criticising me for being absent at a funeral which—</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Job Losses.</heading>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_719">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1193">A Cheann Comhairle, I am grateful to you for selecting this item on the Adjournment tonight. It concerns the closure of the manufacturing facility at one of the oldest main employers in my constituency in Tallaght. Unfortunately, the announcement by Gallaher (Dublin) Limited that it proposes to shed 121 jobs in Tallaght and 130 jobs in Northern Ireland is very bad news for the affected workers and their families. The news comes as a bolt from the blue, and I say that as someone who was aware for some years of the spare capacity at the Ballymena plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">The Tallaght manufacturing facility has survived previous reviews partly because of the excellent track record and productivity at the plant and partly because the management in Tallaght were always able to persuade the corporate company to retain the facility in Dublin. It is a severe blow to the local economy but in particular to the families of the workers directly affected that the battle to retain production at Tallaght has now been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">Gallaher, Ireland, has provided good employment in Tallaght. The jobs now under threat were good jobs. The workers affected were loyal and with an excellent track record both in the industrial relations sense and in terms of productivity. I understand that the average service at the company is approximately 23 years with many employees having served for longer periods. It is part of a disturbing trend that sound, relatively decently paid manufacturing jobs such as this are being lost, not only in Tallaght but around the country, which up to recently has been cloaked by the economic growth which we enjoyed over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">I presume the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, will intervene to assess whether the company can be caused to change its mind in terms of retaining this facility in Tallaght. If the outcome of that is that no such review is feasible, there is an imperative as far as the Government is concerned to ensure that every professional assistance is given to the workers in terms of their rights and entitlements and, more importantly, in terms of assisting them to source new employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">Not many Members in the House will know that this plant is directly across the road from the former Packard Electric plant where in 1995-96 workers lost their jobs in a very acrimonious closure – I still have the scars on my back to prove it. The management at Gallaher's was very helpful with the effective rescue plan which was put in place at that time. I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House tonight that a similar rescue plan will be put in place here and that a task force will be established with a view to sourcing jobs for those who, unfortunately, after a lifetime of service, are to lose good jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">I have no doubt that the company will ensure that decency and best practice will be observed with regard to redundancy and severance pay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_720">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1199">It is important to cross party lines to raise this matter. It was a major shock when the news was heard yesterday, as Deputy Rabbitte has said. Though one hears much about progress in Tallaght – the area is the third largest population centre in the country and has a very young population – it still has an unemployment problem despite progress over the past 14 years. A total of 3,386 people are unemployed and anybody living in Tallaght will say that we have a persistent level of unemployment, certainly in some areas. As has already been said by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, we have suffered a number of job losses over the years, principally Packard, Jacobs and other companies. We need to correct the image that might have been created because as I often say in the House, Tallaght is a positive place in which to live and work. The contribution made by many organisations and institutions, including the institute of technology and the various educational bodies, is something that should be applauded because following Tallaght's black day yesterday, it is important that we look to them for respite.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">I want to record that over the past 40 years, the Gallaher group has been a loyal supporter of the community in Tallaght. It implemented a huge number of initiatives. I was a founder member of Get Tallaght Working, and Tom Clarke, one of  the executives of the company, was deeply involved in that organisation. The group provided a lot of sponsorship and the workers will say it was a great employer. It is important to say that, particularly when I have to say also that there is some disappointment – SIPTU has made this point – that more formal notice was not given to the workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">Our response has to be positive. We have to look for replacement jobs. The Tánaiste must respond in a very positive way by appointing an appropriate task force, which would be important. She also needs to consider a change of policy in the way the Government attracts jobs into the country. I have nothing against the west or any other part of the country but we must understand that communities like Tallaght and the general Dublin area are now being challenged, and job creation initiatives have to be implemented in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">To be parochial, as a matter of urgency the Tánaiste must meet the workers and the unions to discuss their problems and concerns. I ask the Tánaiste, through the Minister of State, to arrange as a matter of urgency for the international management of the Gallaher group to meet the workers and their representatives. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">A number of debates took place this week about CE, social inclusion and other initiatives. In that context, there are some suggestions the Tánaiste should consider as far as this crisis in Tallaght is concerned. For example, a special jobs club for Tallaght to provide training for the 121 people losing their jobs should be created. I am aware that the Tallaght centre for the unemployed, PARTAS and the Tallaght local employment service could develop a model in that regard. A temporary freeze on all the cuts in respect of CE and JI schemes in Tallaght should now be implemented as a direct and positive response to what I have described as a crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">If the closure of the company goes ahead, the State should acquire the Gallaher premises for conversion to an enterprise incubation centre and to devise a joint venture method of developing and operating it with significant private sector participation, perhaps introducing a package of relevant initiatives by way of tax, grants, loans or guarantees which would make private investment realistic. The South Dublin Chamber of Commerce would want to be active in that regard, as I am sure it will be. It would be a pilot scheme for future policy development and I am aware that the South Dublin County Development Board has already called for such initiatives. Such a centre would also accommodate community projects in addition to its primary enterprise focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">In the short-term, the existing mobile unit, Tops, which is run by the Tallaght ICTU centre for the unemployed and funded by FÁS, should  provide an on-site information and advice centre for Gallaher's staff, in conjunction with other services such as PARTAS and the local employment services already mentioned. Even this will be impossible if FÁS withdraws its funding for the mobile unit which, unfortunately, has not yet had a contract for 2003 but only a temporary extension until Monday, 30 June. This is a challenging time for the people of Tallaght and we should show solidarity with the community.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1206">I sincerely thank Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy O'Connor for raising this very important matter on the Adjournment. The first I heard about this issue was when Deputy O'Connor raised it yesterday at our weekly parliamentary party meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">The company in question, the Gallaher group, advised the Tánaiste yesterday, 20 May 2003, that following an extensive review it was announcing plans for the restructuring of its European operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">As a result of this review, it plans to cease all manufacturing in its Dublin factory. The company is also planning to reduce jobs in other European countries. Overall, approximately 430 jobs could be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Here in Ireland, employee numbers are being reduced from 226 to 105. The company will retain 105 non-manufacturing jobs in sales, distribution and warehousing. The company expects that the restructuring of its European operations will help to ensure its success into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">The Tánaiste has been advised by the company that there will be full consultation with its employees in relation to the implementation of the restructuring plans. Arrangements were made by Enterprise Ireland and FÁS to contact the company immediately following the announcement. South Dublin County Enterprise Board has also indicated that it would be prepared to assist in whatever way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">The Tánaiste will ensure that the full services of all the industrial development agencies are made available to assist in whatever way they can. Enterprise Ireland has offered to assist the workforce to identify high potential start-up projects and other enterprise opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Should the company request the assistance of FÁS, it can assist through the provision of intensiveinterviews, individually or in groups, with the affected workers. These interviews would outline the range of supports and services available; the preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral by FÁS of redundant workers to jobs and training courses where necessary; the establishment by FÁS of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">As regards employment opportunities generally in the area, IDA Ireland, which has statutory responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment, continues to work with companies in Tallaght to secure further projects to benefit the area. The development of the Digital Park at City West and the four data centres located at the park – I pay tribute to the local politicians for the way they worked together to ensure this park was developed – are serving the Internet needs of business over a wide area. Tallaght is well placed to attract additional companies in the technology/e-business sector. A number of prominent companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors such as AOL, GE Interlogix, UPS and SAP have already established operations in both Tallaght and the City West areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">In recent months, one of the world's most prominent Internet companies, Google, has decided to locate in the area. In addition, Takeda Chemical Industries, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, has begun construction of a new plant at Grangecastle, Clondalkin, to employ more than 60 people when fully operational. Also in Grangecastle, Wyeth Biopharma currently employs 500 highly skilled people in its new biotechnology facility and this is set to increase to 1,300 when the plant reaches full capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">Enterprise Ireland, the agency with responsibility for indigenous industry development, continues to foster an enterprise culture in the Tallaght-south County Dublin area through its close involvement with local partners. It is working closely with 316 grant assisted projects in the south County Dublin area in helping them to increase their competitiveness and exports. During 2002 alone, Enterprise Ireland provided financial support to 61 projects in south County Dublin at a cost of €2.67 million. The agency also works closely with the institute of technology in Tallaght and has approved funding of €2.54 million towards a new campus innovation centre there. It is expected that work will begin on this project within the next few months. Together with South Dublin County Council, Enterprise Ireland is assisting in the tackling of local unemployment and, in this context, has provided grant assistance to the four community enterprise centres in Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">At the micro-enterprise level, the South Dublin County Enterprise Board has, since its inception, supported projects in the Tallaght area with grants amounting to €2.5 million. It has assisted in the creation of 560 jobs in the area and provided a comprehensive range of supports and training. The county enterprise board will continue to assist other groups, including the Tallaght community group PARTAS, in its enterprise training programmes for the unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">Overall the prospects for Tallaght are very good and with the completion of the Luas project in 2004, it is set to become a key area in the development of greater Dublin despite the job losses announced yesterday by the Gallaher group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">I pay tribute again to the two Deputies who put forward a number of proposals, which I will transmit to the Minister. I acknowledge the contribution made by the Gallaher management and workers over the years. I had reason to deal with some of the management in the past and I knew them to be outstanding people. I am confident that through negotiation, discussions and, I hope, political consensus, it will be possible, in co-operation with the company, to ensure that facilities and opportunities can be provided and utilised to the maximum benefit of the unfortunate workers who will lose their jobs. We are confident that with the support of the State agencies and political leaders on the ground and under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Harney, we will be able to address the situation as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_1219">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the dangerous and disgraceful circumstances and conditions that students attending Castleblayney College in County Monaghan endure while pursuing their education and the intolerable work environment that their teachers are currently forced to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">Is Coláiste den scoth é Coláiste Bhaile na Lurgan agus ba mhaith liom na scoláiri agus na múinteoirí a mholadh. Tá siad ag feidhmiú i gcoiníollacha an-dona ar fad. Is scanallach an rud é go bhfuil bagairt laethúil ann do shláinte agus do shábháilteacht na bpáistí. Iarraím go láidir ar an Aire gníomhú anois agus deireadh a chur leis an bhagairt seo do bheatha na scoláirí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">The country has been in uproar for some time over the broken promises of this Government with regard to the schools building programme. Hundreds of schools have been let down. In all of them conditions are unacceptable. In some the failure of Government to allow necessary work actually presents a threat to life. Castleblayney College in County Monaghan is one such case. It is no exaggeration to say that the Department of Education and Science's failure to address the needs of this college is putting the lives of children in danger. I do not make that charge lightly but do so only because it is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">Castleblayney College's campus is situated on both sides of the N2, a busy national route, the main road from Dublin through County Monaghan to Derry and much of County Donegal. On the west side of the road is a school building dating from 1951 and a number of prefabs. On the east side is the 1969 building and extensions. The  intention back in 1969 when the new building was completed was for the 1951 site to be vacated and the entire campus to be located on the east side. However, growing numbers of students meant that plan could not be carried out. The college needed every square metre of space available to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">This has led to an intolerable and dangerous situation. Students moving from class to class are forced to cross the N2 in all weather conditions by means of a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights. These are often out of order. A survey carried out on 15 March 2000 between 8.45 a.m. and 3.45 p.m. showed that 4,790 vehicles passed along the N2 at the college. In the same period, there were 1,267 crossings by students.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">I have no doubt that with the growth in the economy in the past two years the level of traffic at this point on the N2 has greatly increased. The danger of serious accidents is glaringly obvious except, it seems, to the Department. There was outrage in Castleblayney and beyond, throughout the hinterland from which students come to the college, when it was learned that the major project needed to relocate the entire campus on the eastern site had not been included in the new schools building programme. That outrage has been renewed with the college's exclusion from the new list published this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">The then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, stated to the Castleblayney College board of management in January 2000 that the single campus was urgently needed on the grounds of health and safety. Two years and a general election have passed and the daily danger to the lives of children has not been removed. The board has requested that the current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, visit the school. I urge him to accede to that request. The Minister will be in County Monaghan on this Friday. Will he make the time in his busy schedule?</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">I have visited the school and have been appalled at the conditions in which pupils and teachers have to work. It is not just the issue of the dangerous crossings of the N2. The 1951 building is in a deplorable state. A detailed report on the condition of the building in 2001 showed it was in a bad state of repair and in need of substantial refurbishment. It is a tribute above all to the teachers that the school has survived at all in these conditions. Their heroic efforts have sustained a viable annual intake of pupils, parents acutely aware that Castleblayney College provides a high standard of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">I urge the Minister to act on what is undoubtedly a life and death issue. Must a tragedy occur before action is taken? Must a pupil suffer injury or worse before the Department heeds the repeated pleas of this Deputy and others. We  should not even have to contemplate that possibility but the awful prospect is a daily worry for the pupils, teachers and parents of Castleblayney College. I plead with the Minister to act.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_723">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_1228">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position in relation to Castleblayney College, County Monaghan, and the Department of Education and Science's proposals regarding this matter. Castleblayney College, which has a current enrolment of 310 pupils, operates under the aegis of County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee. It is currently housed in two buildings which are on opposite sides of the N2 national primary route. The main campus is on one side and a smaller, two-storey schoolhouse, built in 1951, is situated on the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">From 1951 to 1969 this smaller building was the main campus for the college. Then, in 1969 a new school building was constructed on the opposite side of the road. The intention was that this new building would cater for all the college's requirements, thereby rendering the 1951 building redundant. However, by the time the new school was built, enrolments at the school had increased to such an extent that the vocational education committee chose to retain the old school as a working facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">Following the construction of a further extension to the new campus in 1999, some 30 years later, it was expected that the old schoolhouse would no longer be required. However, again in light of expanding enrolments the school management authority, County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee, elected to retain its use and requested the Department of Education and Science to provide funding for its refurbishment. The Department agreed to review the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">The accommodation in the 1951 building was then the subject of a condition survey which was submitted to the Department in April 2001. The report stated</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">Given the substantial funding required to refurbish the 1951 schoolhouse, we (the architects) believe that the long-term needs of the college would be better served if this funding were used to provide all the accommodation requirements on the main campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">It was on the basis of this report, which was endorsed by the vocational education committee, that the Department of Education and Science agreed a second extension to the main building as the optimum solution to the school's long-term accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Consistent with normal practice, the planning section of the Department was asked to project long-term enrolments for the college. Following the appropriate analysis, a figure of some 375 students emerged. A schedule of accommodation  based on this projected enrolment figure identified that additional accommodation totalling 909 sq. m. plus a 606 sq. m. physical education hall facility would be required to remove the 1951 schoolhouse from use. This schedule was issued to the vocational education committee on 24 April 2002 and accepted by that body on 15 May 2002. The project in question is currently awaiting the appointment of a design team to initiate the architectural planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">The Minister for Education and Science has gone on record as stating that given the significant number of projects already in the architectural planning system, it is not envisaged that further design team appointments will be made in the current year, except for rationalisation projects. The timing of when a design team will be appointed for this project is dependent on the funding allocation for 2004 and subsequent years. However, it is fact that the Department has, over the past 30 years and more, responded to the needs of Castleblayney College, from the construction of the new school campus in 1969 to the completion of a major extension in 1999. Throughout that period, the school has benefited significantly from an increase in the quantity and quality of the accommodation it offers as one of two post-primary providers in the catchment area. It can expect to benefit in the future from further significant capital funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">It is acknowledged that there is a difficult situation at Castleblayney College involving the need for students to cross the N2 national primary route frequently. In this regard, the vocational education committee, through its chief executive officer, has been made aware that the responsibility, in the first instance, rests with the VEC for the health and safety of the school population when crossing the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">The Department suggested the drawing up of a safety plan at local level involving the Garda Síochána, the county council and all other concerned parties to consider all options including the installation of speed ramps and traffic lights. It is the Minister's understanding that the VEC has taken action in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">A range of further measures may be adopted to mitigate the difficulties surrounding this problem. Critically, the vocational education committee may assess the extent to which only senior cycle students require to use the facilities across the road. A further measure that might be considered involves locating the administrative wing of the school in the old schoolhouse. It is considered that the adoption of the measures suggested would significantly alleviate the difficulties encountered by the school authority in managing the situation, especially with the new school year to commence in September next. I  hope this puts the matter in context for the Deputy.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Education Schemes.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_724">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1239">It does not give me great pleasure to raise this issue on the Adjournment this evening. I am disappointed with the way the Minister and the Government have handled this scheme, which is one of the better schemes introduced by the Government in recent years. There are 6,474 people involved in the back to education allowance scheme. These people are on social welfare, but they retain their social welfare benefits during the summer months when they go back into the education system. However, the Minister has changed that this year. She is now saying that people must sign on at labour exchanges during the summer months. That is a serious change to the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">It is wrong for the Government to enter into an agreement with students and then to change the ground rules. That is what has happened in this case. Approximately 6,000 people thought last year that the scheme would continue until they finished their education. However, that will not happen. I am surprised at the Government and the Minister because these people want to educate themselves so that they will not have to depend on social welfare in the future. They want to contribute to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">The Government is being short-sighted. However, that is nothing new. It has already abolished the summer jobs scheme and many community employment schemes. The latest one to be affected is the back to work scheme. In the past if a person was employed for more than 15 months, he or she qualified for the back to work scheme. However, a person must now be unemployed for more than five years to qualify for it. This is an attack on the poor, the weak and the marginalised. I am surprised at the Minister and the Government for their short-sighted view of education, particularly of the back to education allowance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">I have received representations from people throughout the country, including Dublin, who are upset and annoyed at this change by the Government and the Minister. These people fell out of the education system for one reason or another. They are on social welfare, but they are now back in the education system. Some of them are married and some have children. Many of them were encouraged to get back into the education system because they could retain their social welfare benefits. This scheme has worked. If the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, was here, I would tell her she should not have allowed the Department and the Government to make such a decision because it affects the most marginalised in society. If the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, gets an oppor tunity, he should ask the Government to look at this scheme again. It is wrong to change a scheme which has worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Thousands of people used the scheme because it was the chance for which they were waiting to get back into the education system, while retaining their social welfare benefits. Many of these people will now go to the social welfare offices where they will be told by social welfare officers that they can work for the summer months. Some of them will get into difficulty and they will then have to go to the community welfare officers in the health boards. Many of these people will become disillusioned with the system and they will not go back to education. The Government is being short-sighted. If these people go to third level colleges and get a degree or diploma, they will be in the workplace in the next few years and they will be able to contribute to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">The Government has made a mistake. I call on the Government to change its mind. What it has done is wrong. If the Government entered into a three year agreement tomorrow morning with a contractor, it would not try to change it in the middle of the three year term. That is what is happening in this case. People who went back into the education system last September believed the scheme would be available for the three years they would be in full-time education. However, the ground rules have been changed. The Minister should allow those already in the scheme to continue to get their benefits and she could tell the new people the rules have changed. The Government is wrong and it will regret it in the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_1245">I am happy to reply to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. She asked me to inform the House and the Deputy that she regrets she cannot be here tonight as she is out of the country on Government business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">The Department of Social and Family Affairs administers a range of back to education programmes under the umbrella of its employment support services to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to return to work through the acquisition and improvement of skills and academic qualifications which will enable them to compete more successfully for employment. The fundamental aim of the back to education allowance scheme is to assist people who are unable to access the labour market because of a lack of qualifications or education and who are caught up in a cycle of unemployment and disadvantage. For example, the scheme has given many people who left school early a second chance for education which will improve their prospects of getting employment. It is important for the House to recognise that since we returned to office in 1997 there has been an 18 fold increase in adult edu cation and further life long learning opportunities for people who did not have the opportunity during their educational careers. That has had a major impact on education.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1247">The Government is taking it back from them when they need it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_727">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_1248">Following a review by the Department of Social and Family Affairs of the basic purpose underlying the back to education provisions and, in light of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, it was decided that the scheme should be again focused towards people who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In the past, the generous back to education allowance scheme provided for payment to be made to persons during the summer period between academic years. However, people who were previously unemployed often find work opportunities, similar to the student summer jobs scheme, either at home or abroad during the summer months. In such circumstances and in order to ensure that resources focus on the most vulnerable in our community, it is inappropriate to continue payment for this period. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">Participants on the back to education allowance scheme who must, as an integral part of their course, undergo a period of work placement, work experience or research during the summer months will continue to receive the allowance for this period. That area of activity and the focused opportunity will be sustained through the monetary support available. This decision affects only back to education allowance scheme participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to participation in the scheme. Participants who accessed the scheme by way of a disability or lone parent payment are not affected and will continue to receive the allowance during the summer. Only a small group will be affected. It should also be noted that back to education allowance scheme participants, who are progressing to the next year of their course or progressing in qualifications, will have their back to education allowance reinstated from the beginning of the new academic year, irrespective of whether they were employed or in receipt of an unemployment payment during the summer. There will not be a negative impact when they return to their academic studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">As regards changes in the scheme as it relates to postgraduates, my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is satisfied that those in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their  employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint, she wants to ensure that supports are directed to those with more pressing needs. The Minister recently asked her officials to liaise with the relevant bodies to identify specific postgraduate courses, such as the higher diploma in education, which add significantly to a person's employability and to which the back to education allowance should continue to apply. As a consequence, the Department of Social and Family Affairs will continue to support those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or a graduate diploma in primary school teaching, which shows flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">In framing proposals to change elements of the back to education allowance scheme, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on  those most at risk from long-term unemployment. The Minister believes in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that people in the greatest need of assistance under the scheme have been protected. I am sure Deputy Ring concurs with that. The Minister has done her best to ensure that everyone gets support at a critical time to maximise their opportunities—</p>

The question of the relationship between the corps and the Garda, particularly whether it will be under the overall control of the Commissioner, is central to the development of this proposal. The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps will require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability. Establishment of the corps will be progressed in tandem with the preparation of the necessary legislation. In addition to the consultation process, my Department has written to all EU member states in relation to the structure of  traffic policing in these countries. The responses received are being examined.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1266">The mandate of the restructuring implementation group is to oversee the restructuring of CIE. The group will remain in place until all elements of the restructuring, including the necessary legislative changes, are implemented. It will report to me as necessary throughout the restructuring process. At present, the focus is on the detailed preparatory work required for the restructuring. I will bring a progress report on the work undertaken to date to the Government in the near future. It is not possible to put an exact cost on the restructuring of CIE, pending the completion of the detailed preparatory work. The cost will depend on how certain key issues, such as debt and insurance, are addressed. Given the constraints on the Exchequer, however, it is my objective to implement the restructuring without imposing a significant additional cost burden on the Exchequer or the CIE Group. The future arrangements for CIE Tours will be considered as part of the detailed restructuring work. I am not contemplating any change to the ownership structure of the company at the present time, however.</p>

          <p eId="para_1274">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 121 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">A comprehensive review of speed limits is currently under way. The review will address all of the major issues relating to speed limit policy, including the range of speed limits deployed on roadways and in relation to particular categories of vehicles, including heavy goods vehicles; the signage used to indicate speed limits; and the implications of the adoption of metric values for speed measurement. A broadly based working group, which has been established to carry out this review, has already commenced its consideration of this complex subject. It is intended that the review will be completed this summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">The last comprehensive review of speed limits was carried out between 1990 and 1992. The speed limit for heavy goods vehicles was increased from 40 mph to 50 mph at that stage. Since 1996 it is mandatory under EU law that goods vehicles over 12 tonnes in weight be fitted with a speed limitation device set at 85 kph and such that the vehicle itself cannot exceed a speed of 90 kph. The equivalent imperial values are approximately 52.8 mph and 55.9 mph respectively. Directive 2002/85/EC provides for the extension of the fitting of speed limitation devices to further categories of vehicles, including goods vehicles in the 3.5 to 10 tonnes weight range, from 1 January 2005. The mandatory annual roadworthiness test for vehicles requiring speed limitation devices has been more stringent since 1 January 2003 – the device is examined to establish whether it is functioning correctly. The enforcement of road traffic law in relation to speeding offences and vehicle standards is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</p>

          <p eId="para_1280">The QBC committee of the Dublin Transportation Office, which involves the local authorities in the greater Dublin area, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and the Garda, is responsible for overall policy on planning QBCs, consistent with Platform for Change, and for developing QBC programmes. The committee reports regularly to the DTO steering committee. The quality bus network project office of Dublin City Council is responsible for the implementation of the QBC programme on behalf of the local authorities in the greater Dublin area. Financial approval for any particular QBC is given, on a case by case basis, by the traffic management grants committee of the DTO. Some 80% of the funding of the QBN project office is provided by the DTO, with local authorities providing the balance. The cost of the construction of QBCs is met by the DTO and my Department meets all the DTO costs.</p>

Given the success to date of QBCs in strengthening the role of the bus in meeting public transport needs, I am anxious to see an acceleration of the QBC programme in Dublin.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_122">Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Luas project rests with the Railway Procurement Agency. The detail of individual contracts is a matter for the agency. I understand from the agency, however, that the contractual completion dates – October 2003 for lines A and C and December 2003 for line B – will not be  met and that the contractor involved has indicated that a 16-week delay can be expected. The RPA has told me that, based on its projections, a more realistic timetable for completion is May 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station line and March 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line. A period of up to three months will be required following these dates for testing, commissioning and general safety checking before passenger services can commence. I have conveyed my concerns about the delays to the RPA and I have asked that the necessary steps be taken to ensure that services commence at the earliest possible date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_123">The initial budget submitted to the Department by CIE for the project was €466 million in 1999 prices, based on preliminary estimates. This budget was subsequently revised in February 2001 to €675 million to take account of actual competitive tender prices received, reflecting high inflation in the construction sector, higher than anticipated property acquisition costs and changes to the scope of the project, mainly related to the upgrading of line B to metro status. Capital funding for the construction of the lines, estimated currently at €691 million, is in place. The RPA has also made provision for risk. I do not wish to give any further details of the risk provision, for contractual reasons, as to do so could prejudice ongoing negotiations with contractors in this regard.</summary>

It is on a par with best international practice in terms of tunnel height. In a survey of 12 countries, ten had height provisions equal to or less than the Dublin Port tunnel. Any amendment to the design of the tunnel to allow for a greater clearance height could unacceptably compromise safety in the tun nel and significantly delay the opening of this important infrastructure. It would also have considerable financial implications.

The RPA has told me that, based on its projections, a more realistic timetable for completion would be March 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line and May 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station line. The RPA is in negotiation with the contractor as regards the consequences of these delays. A period of up to three months will be required following these dates for testing, commissioning and general safety checking before passenger services can commence. I have conveyed my concerns about the delays to the RPA and I have asked that the necessary steps be taken to ensure that services commence at the earliest possible date.</p>

          <p eId="para_1322">The recently published strategic rail review provides Government with a policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland. This will have a positive role in helping to alleviate growing congestion, reverse ever-increasing car dependency, maintain economic competitiveness and prioritise balanced regional development. Iarnród Éireann is considering the review and will shortly present a prioritised investment programme in light of its findings. The timetabling of various projects will be considered in the light of available Exchequer resources. An implementation group, containing representatives of my Department and Iarnród Éireann, has been established to ensure effective implementation of the review. The group is charged with monitoring the implementation of the investment and providing quarterly progress reports. I am not aware of any serious examples of discrepancies in the review. The errors that have been identified have been found not to be of major significance and do not undermine the report's important findings and recommendations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_127">The western rail corridor is one of a number of schemes that was evaluated in the review. While it was noted in the report that this scheme complements the objectives of the national spatial strategy, the consultants did not include it in their recommended investment strategy. The review found that a separate detailed evaluation of the western rail corridor, involving complementary land use and settlement policies, would need to be examined rigorously to ensure that the scheme, or any element of it, satisfies rail viability requirements in terms of patronage and revenue generation. The review lays down a challenge to those supporting schemes such as the western rail  corridor to establish a clear and convincing case on economic, social and infrastructure grounds. As a first step, there are to be discussions between my Department, the Western Development Commission and the regional and local authorities to explore the conditions and circumstances that would be necessary to attract the required levels of rail patronage that would justify investment in the western rail corridor.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">The strategic rail review also examined the Limerick Junction-Rosslare route. Given the route's poor results under the evaluation, it would require a significant change of circumstances to exhibit a strong case for this proposal. However, as I stated before, it now lies with the supporters of schemes such as this one to develop a convincing case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_129">The Cork suburban rail proposal was considered in the context of the recommendations of the Cork area strategic plan and the recently completed Faber Maunsell feasibility study. The strategic rail review's analysis affirms the positive conclusions of the feasibility study and noted that the rail proposal also complements the aims of the national spatial strategy. Iarnród Éireann is reviewing the Cork suburban rail feasibility report and I am awaiting its response.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_130">Penalty points for speeding have been operating since 31 October 2002. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences and to those  who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. Preliminary indications from the Garda Síochána in respect of the operation of the system to date show that, with no reduction in enforcement efforts, there has been a significant drop in the number of detections for speeding offences. There was also a significant reduction in road deaths over that period. In the first six months of the operation of the system the number of road deaths was 143, compared to 211 in the period from November 2001 to April 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. The compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file, which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that 19,375 penalty point notices have issued as at 12 May 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">Penalty points are endorsed on the licence record held in the national driver file upon conviction for a speeding offence or upon payment of a fixed charge. The system operates in such a way that the offer of paying a fixed charge is always provided and a person has 56 days within which to pay the charge. If they opt not to pay, the case is taken to court. These periods are built into the system and ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the person to pay the fixed charge and avoid a court hearing. There is therefore an inevitable time lapse between the issue of the notices, the payment of the fixed charge and the notification of the endorsement of penalty points. The fact that the processing of notices by the Garda is operated on a manual basis is a further contributory factor to the time lapses. This may result in a number of cases where drivers have been detected, but the points have yet to be endorsed on the licence record.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">I propose to introduce penalty points for driving without insurance with effect from 1 June 2003. I am also consulting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda for the purpose of applying the system to seat belt offences committed by drivers. The extension of the operation of the penalty points system to all of the offences listed in the First Schedule of the Act will be pursued with a view to applying the penalty points system fully by mid-2004, when the necessary Garda computer system should be ready.</summary>

Further expenditure was incurred on cycleways provided in conjunction with bus priority, for which over €15 million was provided in total. Some €40 million is being provided for traffic management grants in 2003. A high priority continues to be afforded to funding the provision by local authorities of cycle routes under this grant scheme. To date, 170 km of cycle network – QBC cycle facilities and dedicated cycle facilities – has been constructed in the greater Dublin area, together with 2,500 cycle parking spaces. The DTO is conducting a review of the regional cycle strategy and facilities and developing a four-year action plan for cycling between 2003 and 2006.

The work involves lengthening platforms at many stations, the purchase of an additional 40 DART cars and upgrading the power supply. This work is due for completion in 2005. Phase 2 of the DASH project will involve upgrading the signalling system to allow for more train paths through the bottlenecks at Connolly Station and the loop line to Pearse Station.

          <p eId="para_1333">The tunnel under the Phoenix Park, linking Heuston Station and Connolly Station, is used for unscheduled and occasional services such as GAA matches. The main constraint on its use for scheduled services is the track work and signalling at Connolly Station and between Connolly Station and Pearse Station. The system is running at full capacity at present. I am informed by Irish Rail that it would not be possible to accommodate additional services through the tunnel from the west side of Dublin without restricting existing services, except on the limited number of occasions outside peak times that I have already mentioned. Increasing the capacity of the signalling system in and around Connolly Station forms part of the programme of enhancing the Dublin area suburban railway system, DASH. Irish Rail informs me this work will be undertaken in Phase II of the project, commencing in early 2005. Irish Rail is undertaking a separate feasibility study on the proposed interconnector tunnel proposed by the Dublin Transportation Office in its strategy, Platform for Change, and in this regard I have asked the company to re-examine the case for the more extensive use of the Phoenix Park tunnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_1337">The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority  under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000. Any proposal to open the West Link bridge free of charge to motorists at peak times would require an amendment to the relevant tolling agreement, which would be a matter for the NRA to consider given its statutory role and powers. As the Deputy is aware, the M50 has experienced substantial traffic growth since its first phase opened in 1991. The second West Link bridge, which is expected to open to traffic in August 2003, will significantly ease congestion at the toll booths. I understand that the NRA is also considering additional improvements to the M50 to further ease congestion.</p>

My Department is engaged in a process of consultation with relevant interested parties and stakeholders. In this regard, there has been a number of consultation meetings with the Aer Rianta unions over recent months. I personally attended two of the meetings to elaborate on the background and policy drivers in relation to both the initiatives. The Taoiseach and I also met last week with Mr. David Begg, the general secretary of ICTU, and other trade union representatives to discuss these important issues.</p>

Where my Department had no comments on the proposed new services or proposed service changes, the relevant company was advised that the proposals had been noted by my Department.

          <p eId="para_1387">Last year, the Government agreed that the development of the Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis and as a public private partnership. It also decided that a link from the city centre to Dublin Airport was to be included in Phase 1. Since then, the Railway Procurement Agency has concentrated its work on developing proposals for this phase. A preliminary public consultation has taken place and a prequalification exercise for potential bidders was launched by the agency in mid-2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">In November 2002, my Department received the outline business case for Phase 1 of the metro from the RPA. The Dublin metro is the largest proposed infrastructure project in the history of the State. Careful consideration of the outline business case is being undertaken. The estimated costs are substantial and a number of additional aspects of the proposal are being assessed as part of my evaluation of the OBC. These additional aspects concern the potential impact of the project on the general Government balance in the context of the EU Stability and Growth Pact; and the legal, planning and technical considerations based on practice elsewhere, particularly Madrid where the authorities developed a strong international reputation for the speedy completion of the Madrid metro extensions at a relatively low cost. More recently, Iarnród Éireann submitted preliminary proposals for a heavy rail link to Dublin Airport by extending a spur from the northern suburban line.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_147">I am also considering proposals for legislative change to accelerate and streamline the delivery  of critical infrastructure projects, thereby reducing the cost of such infrastructure. Following consideration of all these issues by my Department in the coming weeks, I intend to bring proposals to the Government. Additional Luas lines are part of the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, A Platform for Change. Decisions on the alignment of such lines will be dependent on the alignment chosen for the metro.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1391">I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 148 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">The key provisions of the Road Traffic Act 2002 provide for the introduction of a penalty points system for a wide range of motoring offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">Sections of the Act that relate both directly and indirectly to the operation of penalty points were commenced with effect from 31 October 2002 to facilitate the operation of the system in respect of speeding offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">In addition to the sections relating directly to the penalty points system, sections 2 to 7, those sections relating to the introduction of a fixed charge system to replace the current on the spot fine system, section 11, increases in the general penalties, section 23, and the extension of the use of electronic equipment for the detection of offences, section 21, were commenced with effect from 31 October 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">The requirement for full and provisional licence holders to carry their licence as set out in section 18 of the Act, and a provision that local authorities can make arrangements for the functions conferred on traffic wardens to be carried out by persons employed by the authority, or persons authorised in writing to perform those functions, section 12(2), have been commenced since 1 January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">Section 15 empowers local authorities to decide on the number and location of taxi stands and to govern their operation. This responsibility was previously vested in the Garda Commissioner with the consent of the Minister. I signed a commencement order bringing this section into operation with effect from 1 February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">I propose to introduce penalty points for driving without insurance with effect from 1 June 2003. I am also in consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda for the purpose of applying the system to seat belt offences committed by drivers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_149">The extension of the operation of the penalty points system to all of the offences listed in the First Schedule of the Act will be pursued with a view to applying the penalty points system fully by mid-2004, when the necessary Garda computer system should be ready.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_150">The necessary preparatory work to facilitate commencement of the remaining sections of the Act is under way in my Department in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the local authorities and the Attorney General.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1401">The position in relation to the application of restrictions to the availability of taxi licences was established in an October 2000 decision of the High Court which established the legal position that quantitative limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing taxi licence holders cannot be sustained. In compliance with that decision, in November 2000, regulations were made which liberalised entry to the taxi market and removed all regulatory provisions involving quantitative restrictions on the licensing of taxis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">The imposition of a general moratorium on the availability of taxi licences can not be contemplated having regard to the terms and focus of that High Court decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">It should be noted that the same vehicle and driver standards continue to apply to new taxi licence applicants and drivers of taxis as applied to applicants prior to November 2000. While there were restrictions on the number of small public service vehicles prior to November 2000, there have never been any quantitative restrictions on the granting of licences to drive such vehicles. All applicants for such licences are vetted by the Garda for the purpose of establishing if applicants are fit and proper persons to hold such licences.</p>

          <p eId="para_1414">I have been advised by the Attorney General that the present regulations prohibiting the use of mobile phones by drivers, and which are based on the 1961 Road Traffic Act, are open to challenge in the courts on the grounds that they may be <i>ultra vires.</i> The uncertainty is being compounded by the scope and speed of developments in in-car technologies.

          <p eId="para_1423">The national development plan, together with the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme, form the strategic policy context for the upgrading of the national road network in the period to 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">The implementation of individual projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_152">The position overall on the upgrading of the five inter-urban routes is that good progress has been made. Of the total of 31 projects on these routes two have been completed, six are under way, work is due to start on two more, and plan ning and design work is well advanced on the remaining 21 projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">Preferred route corridors have been identified for all projects. The completion shortly of three major projects on the M1 will provide a motorway standard route from Dublin to just south of Dundalk. In addition a substantial programme of work is under way and in planning on other national routes. Major projects under construction include the Glen of the Downs and Ashford/Rathnew bypasses on the N11 and Ballincollig bypass on the N25.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">Exchequer investment in the national roads programme has increased dramatically. Total Exchequer investment in the national roads programme over the period 2000-2003 will amount to €3.823 billion. This is approximately 13% greater than the amount provided for in the NDP. Investment in the programme in 2003 has been maintained at a high level despite the more difficult economic and budgetary conditions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">The increased cost of the programme however has impacted on the pace and momentum of implementation. Delivery of some projects including those on the major inter-urban routes will, therefore, take longer than originally anticipated. On the basis of a continuation of existing levels of funding the NRA estimates that full completion of the major inter-urban routes could extend to 2009-2010. However, route completion dates will depend on the funding levels available in the years ahead, including from additional funding sources, and on construction and land acquisition costs. I seek to ensure that the major inter-urban routes are completed to motorway-high quality standard to the greatest extent possible by 2006 and in any event earlier than 2009-2010.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1426">The programme for Government provides for the continued support of our six regional airports and for regional air access. My Department provides three financial mechanisms in support of this objective, namely, subvention of the PSO services which facilitate air access to the regions concerned, the allocation of assistance towards marketing, safety and security related expenditure incurred by the regional airports and capital grant assistance towards infrastructural improvements  under the regional operational programmes of the NDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Future policy will be guided by the need to ensure that the strategy adopted to facilitate regional air access is supported by sound economic rationale. An expenditure review of the PSO programme is currently being undertaken by my Department. The basic purpose of the review is to evaluate the degree to which the objectives of the PSO programme warrant the ongoing allocation of Exchequer support, on a route-by-route basis, and to examine the scope for alternative policy or new approaches to achieving the objectives on a more efficient and/or effective basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1463">The agreed programme for Government sets out commitments in relation to taxi services including the appointment of a regulator for the future regulation of licensing, standards and the quality of service. On 19 November 2002 the Government approved proposals for the establishment, initially on a non-statutory basis, of an office of national taxi regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">Subject to the enactment of legislation, it is envisaged that the office of the taxi regulator will have a national focus and will have full effective control over the promotion of a professional, efficient and customer friendly service by all small public service vehicles, including taxis, hackneys and limousines. This will include the overall development and application of standards for drivers, licence holders and for vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465">The preparation of the necessary legislation to support the establishment of a commission for taxi regulation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department and I hope to be in a position to bring detailed proposals in this regard to Government following a consultation process with other Departments which is currently under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">While the necessary legislative changes are being prepared, the appointment of a chairman of the commission is being progressed independently in order that the office can be operational on a non-statutory basis. Proposals relating to the creation of this post and an allied staff support framework are the subject of consultation with the Department of Finance.</p>

As part of this process the independent evaluator – Indecon economic consultants – will, <i>inter alia</i>, review economic and other relevant developments since 1999, progress to date in the implementation of the programme, programme management and efficiency, project selection, and the indicators in use for the monitoring of the programme.

          <p eId="para_1495">My Department met Veterinary Ireland, the body that represents temporary veterinary inspectors, TVIs, engaged in the meat inspection service of my Department on 20 December 2002 to discuss TVI shifts in the context of budgetary allocations for 2003. A number of issues were discussed including the need to make the most efficient use of the resources allocated under the Estimate for this purpose, while ensuring that appropriate standards of public health, food safety and animal welfare are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">No formal meetings have taken place since then with Veterinary Ireland on this subject. However, at local level there is day-to-day contact between veterinary inspectors in charge of meat plants and TVIs in the normal course of their duties to arrange shift rosters in meat plants.</p>

          <p eId="para_1501">The person named applied for premium for 57 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. An 80% advance instalment for €9,400.44 issued to him on 28 November 2001. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme producers with more than 15 reckonable livestock units may be paid premium on up to two reckonable livestock units per hectare of the forage area of his-her holding as established from the producer's 2001 area aid application. Any cattle submitted for 2001 suckler cow and special beef premium over and above the two livestock units limit shall not be paid such premium. The livestock units are calculated taking into account male cattle on which the producer applies for special beef premium, ewes submitted for 2001 ewe premium, notional dairy cows needed to produce any milk quota held and suckler cows or heifers for which suckler cow premium has been requested. The area aid record for the person named shows 74.82 hectares of forage area which would allow payment on a maximum of 149.64 livestock units. At balance payment stage a recalculation of the amount due under the 2001 suckler cow scheme found that the person named had been paid on 111.20 livestock units under the special beef premium scheme and 7.05 livestock units under the ewe premium scheme leaving 31.39 livestock units of suckler cow payable at a rate of €206.15. No balance payment was therefore due and the overpayment incurred has since been recovered from moneys due under 2001 special beef and 2001 ewe premium balances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">The person named has been paid in full in respect of 168 animals under the special beef premium scheme 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">The person named participated in 2001 extensification premium opting for the census system. Based on the bovine animal number declarations made by the person named on his CEN.1 and 2 forms at all five census dates, the stocking density of the holding for 2001 was 2.3492 livestock units per hectare. Due to foot and mouth disease control measures that were in place during the early part of 2001, a 0.8 coefficient was applied to the livestock unit value of the animals declared by herdowners in respect of the first and second census dates in 2001 in compliance with EU Commission Regulation 1900/2000. When the coefficient was applied to the livestock unit value of the animals declared by the person named at the first two census dates, it reduced the stocking density to 2.1590 livestock units per hectare. This was still in excess of the 2.0 livestock unit per hectare limit that would enable my Department to pay extensification premium in this case.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_198">(i) The figures at (a) and (b) are PAYE figures. The average tax payment for each year at (a) is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, for example, the 2002 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 2002. This number excludes income earners on the PAYE tax record who are exempt from tax.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_199">(ii) The average tax payment for each year in column (b) is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the total number of income earners on the PAYE tax record including those who are exempt from tax.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">(i) In calculating (c), the farming figures, the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units assessed to tax for the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, for example, the 2002 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 2002. These numbers exclude cases who are not  required to file annual tax returns and whose position is reviewed periodically because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability on an individual basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">(ii) The figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession. Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_202">(iii) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be precisely distinguished. Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_203">(i) The figures for (d), other self-employed figures, are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year, subject to certain technical adjustments, from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for farming figures.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1588">Up to October 1998, my Department's capacity to respond to individual children with special needs was limited. This changed with a Government decision in October 1998 whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589">Since this automatic entitlement to support was introduced, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to 2,300 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to 4,062 full-time and a further 1,177 part-time posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590">The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally assessed needs of each individual child. While my Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools, students who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes-units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. The response will normally take the form of resource teacher or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the level of need involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">In some cases the level of special need involved may be such as to require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has grown from 350 to more than 500 since 1998. Each such class is dedicated to a particular disability category and operates at a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio. Children attending these special classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_211">Children with special needs attending mainstream schools may also require access to special equipment to assist them in their education. The funding allocation in this area has grown from €671,000 in 1998 to a current figure of €3.8 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_212">In addition to maintaining the ongoing development of these services, I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place for an efficient and effective system for service delivery. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive was appointed recently to the council and it is intended that the council will be vested shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_213">I also intend to bring forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, to clarify the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and to put in place the necessary framework to deliver the required services. My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_214">I am confident that the measures which I have outlined will ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_215">It is only in exceptional cases that my Department considers an educational placement outside the country as being necessary. In general, the care needs of children within an education context are met through the special needs assistant service.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_216">A range of measures to improve teacher supply has been introduced in recent years. The intake  to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_217">Since 1996, postgraduate diploma courses have been run by the colleges of education to increase further the number of B.Ed graduates. In February 2002, 461 students commenced the postgraduate course and these students will graduate in June 2003. A total of 1,633 students completed the postgraduate course between 1996 and 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_218">The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_219">Between 2002 and 2003, it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. A further postgraduate course commenced in February, 2003 with a maximum of 460 places available on the course which will conclude in May-June 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second-level trained teachers currently teaching in primary schools, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and the necessary academic requirement in Irish. This proposal will be discussed with the colleges of education in the near future and, if implemented, would enable these teachers to become fully qualified primary teachers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">I am confident that the measures outlined above are contributing significantly to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. I am committed to ensuring that the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated within the next two to three years.</summary>

This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000-01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. It is available to full-time and part- time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered here by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states.

          <p eId="para_1630">Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school books are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level.

I consider that locally operated schemes are the appropriate and efficient way to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631">School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date. I am satisfied the problem of disposal of unwanted textbooks is minimised to the greatest extent possible by the policies operated by my Department.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_225">My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second level. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship. Principal  teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1664">In recent days, my Department has advised the Not for Profit business organisation of an additional allocation of €5.85 million to relieve the under funding of its member organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1665">Further claims amounting to more than €5 million have been made by the association and these claims are being considered by my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the association itself, having regard to the availability of funds. Additional claims for extra staff numbers will also be considered in the light of available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1666">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1667">This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers on service provision this year.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1674">There are no plans to introduce legislation which would permit the deliberate destruction of human embryos.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_229">In relation to assisted human reproduction services generally, while there is no legislation regulating this area at present, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct. I am conscious of concerns about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established  the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area. When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. Given the complexity of the issues under examination, it is difficult to be definitive about when the work of the commission will be completed. I am, however, satisfied that it is working as expeditiously as is feasible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_230">In relation to EU funded programmes, the following sets out the position with regard to both the sixth framework research programme for the EU (FP6) which will run from 2002 to 2006, and EU aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries: the specific programmes for research under FP6 were agreed at the EU Competitiveness Council meeting on 30 September 2002 following a Danish presidency compromise concerning the funding of ethically controversial research under FP6. All member states with the exception of Italy accepted the compromise proposal. My colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has lead responsibility for FP6, has advised that the agreement reached guarantees respect for national legislation and regulations, which means that FP6 cannot fund any research activity in Ireland which would not satisfy Irish ethical requirements. FP6 excludes several ethically controversial areas of research activity from funding, namely research aimed at human reproductive cloning, modification of the genetic heritage of human beings and the creation of human embryos solely for the purposes of research or stem cell procurement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_231">The agreement reached at the EU Competitiveness Council also introduced a moratorium up to 31 December 2003 on the funding of research under FP6 on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells, with the exception of the study of banked or isolated human embryonic stem cells in culture. The moratorium is designed to allow for a period of further consultation, during which the Commission will present to Council and Parliament in spring 2003 a report on human embryonic stem cell research which will form the basis for discussion at an inter-institutional seminar on bioethics. The Commission will then have to submit a proposal establishing further guidelines on principles for deciding on the Community funding of research projects involving the use of human embryos and human embryonic stem cells. This proposal will then have to be considered by Council following full consultation with Parliament.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">In addition to the moratorium, a regulatory committee made up of representatives appointed by member states will be established and will be  used if any proposed research actions involve ethically sensitive areas. Ireland will have a significant input into the work of the regulatory committee and the deliberations in Council on the proposal, which the Commission must bring forward.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_233">Regarding the financing of EU research in FP6, the only funding involved comes from the EU budget. Clearly, the Commission will have to respect the Irish Constitution, Irish regulations and Irish ethical principals if it proposes to fund any research in Ireland. Any suggestion that the Commission should, in effect, seek to apply provisions of the Irish Constitution to restrict activities in other member states where those activities are both legal and ethical, cannot be sustained.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_234">Finally, in agreeing to the adoption of the specific programmes, Ireland entered a statement in the Council minutes which recalled our earlier statements and which shared a number of the concerns expressed by Italy, Germany, Portugal and Austria. It also pointed out that Ireland will continue to focus on the need to ensure the utmost respect for human life and the protection of human dignity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">The following regulations govern EU aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries. The European Commission in March 2002 submitted a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament for a new regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries. The previous regulation expired on 31 December last, having been in force since July 1997. The purpose of both the previous regulation and its proposed replacement is to allow the Commission to continue to support programmes in developing countries in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights. The Commission's role in development co-operation is laid down in Articles 177-181 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">The previous regulation and its proposed replacement form an important part of the EU's development policy. In particular, the legislation addresses the specific UN millennium development goal relating to maternal health, which calls for the reduction of maternal mortality by three-quarters over the period 1990 to 2015. Throughout the developing world, and particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in childbirth because health systems cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">The draft regulation, like the previous 1997 – 2002 instrument, is based on the programme of action agreed at the Cairo international conference on population and development in 1994 and the "Cairo+5" follow-up conference of 1999. Ireland's position in the Council negotiations on both the draft regulation and its predecessor has been that they must be in strict conformity with the Cairo programme of action, which provides that abortion is not to be promoted as a family planning method and that regulations regarding  abortion are solely for individual countries to decide. We are satisfied that the draft regulation in its current form meets this requirement and that it represents a substantial contribution by the Union towards implementation of the millennium development goals, to which the international community is committed.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1680">The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the speciality and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_239">The institute replied in May 2001 to the CMO and confirmed that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients, mainly at the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe  Hospital. Excellent results were claimed for this procedure which had the effect of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis. Sepsis was one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute stated that in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicated favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_240">The institute stated that from 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was replaced by the modern caesarean section. Antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_241">We must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience.

          <p eId="para_1682">Responsibility for the management and treatment of a person with bulimia and other eating disorders rests with the individual patient's clinician. However, persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated through the psychiatric services of their local health board. Outpatient psychiatric services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres. Where in-patient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital, beds being allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time. A tertiary referral service for eating disorders is available to public patients in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin where three in-patient beds are designated for this purpose.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1686">Following the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the  organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1687">Given the key role of the health boards executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1688">In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1689">Given these constraints my Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional post-graduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase from end-1999 to end-2002, from 26 to 83, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690">My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis, with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the action plan for people management published in November, 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support post-graduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is currently examining the current model for post-graduate psychology training, with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_246">With regard to the issue of vacancies, the Deputy may wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 40%, an addition of 121 to 412, over  the three years to end-2002 in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service which has contributed to a significant increase in the volume of psychological services provided.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">In addition to measures to increase the supply of psychologists through the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review report, it should be recognised that other efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the psychological services, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the recruitment of psychologists from overseas by the health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the devolution of responsibility for recruitment of basic grade psychologist posts to health boards from the Local Appointments Commission. Ongoing pay enhancements through the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to reducing current vacancy levels by increasing the attractiveness of employment as a clinical psychologist in the health services.</summary>

On the advice of the board's public health specialist, contact tracing of all "at risk" persons was carried out in accordance with the board's agreed procedures. A consultant respiratory physician advised the general public by local radio on the low level of risk associated with TB. All staff members working at the facility in question have been informed of the outbreak. The occupational health physician has been to the facility twice to address staff concerns and all staff have been given the opportunity to visit their own GP. Clients infected with or suspected of having TB are put under the care of the board's medical team and are nursed in accordance with established protocols. Any ongoing concerns for staff and the general public are addressed by the board as they arise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1730">I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 to 228, inclusive, and 232 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">The provision of passenger capacities on individual rail routes is an operational matter for Irish Rail, while the provision by Bus Éireann of capacity on individual bus routes is an operational matter for them. However, I understand from Irish Rail that in the period between 2000 and the end of 2002 they introduced 38 new DART carriages and 20 new diesel rail cars to Dublin suburban rail services. This allowed them, <i>inter alia,</i> to deliver a 100% capacity increase on the Maynooth-Dublin line. The first phase of the Kildare route enhancement will be delivered in 2003. This involves the construction of a turn-back facility at Newbridge and eight-car platforms at Sallins and Hazlehatch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">The delivery of 80 new diesel rail cars to Irish Rail has already commenced and Irish Rail has informed me they will all be in service by the end of this year. They are destined for use on outer suburban services serving Dublin and Cork. The completion of the work on the Kildare line, mentioned above, and the commissioning of the new rail cars will increase peak-hour capacity as follows: Northern line – 43%; Arklow-Dublin – 30%; Maynooth line – 24%; and Kildare line – 130%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733">Irish Rail has recently embarked on phase one of what is known as the DASH project – DART and suburban enhancement – to cater for the operation of eight-car DARTs. This project will be completed in 2005. Phase two of the DASH project involves the resignalling of the tracks to cater for shorter headways, allow for more frequent trains and increase the number of trains passing through Connolly Station from ten to 12 trains per hour in each direction. This will allow the operation of more trains in the morning and evening peaks on the Maynooth line.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734">Bus Éireann assures me that it monitors passenger loads on all of its routes into Dublin from the Kildare area and will respond with additional frequencies as demand increases. Since 2000, Bus Éireann has increased its capacity on commuter routes into Dublin by 40%. Up to 50% of new vehicle purchases under the NDP have been allocated to such routes.</p>

The manner in which the Luas trams cross from the southwest quadrant of the M50-N7, Naas Road, junction to the median of the N7 east of the Red Cow roundabout was agreed by all of the agencies involved and implementation of the approved plans is now well advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739">An important element of the Luas project is the provision of park and ride and bus interchange facilities adjacent to the Red Cow stop.

There were also 150 additional buses purchased in 1999, resulting in an overall increase of 23% in peak hour capacity today compared with 1999.

          <p eId="para_1744">Pending completion of all the detailed preparatory work, it is not possible for me to put an exact cost on the restructuring of CIE.

          <p eId="para_1745">It is clear from an earlier independent review carried out on behalf of my Department by property specialists that there is the potential to generate significant revenue from the disposal of property which is surplus to public transport requirements. However it is not possible to be precise about the revenue to be generated as this will depend on a range of factors, including market conditions at the time of disposal. The arrangements for the disposal of surplus property will be considered as part of the ongoing preparatory work for the restructuring of CIE.

      asked the

          <p eId="para_1794">Local authorities are responsible for assessing housing needs, including joint tenancy applications, in accordance with their locally adopted schemes of letting priorities. In making an assessment, local authorities have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the income and family circumstances of the applicant. My Department understands that an application for joint tenancy following marriage would generally be accepted by a local authority subject to their being satisfied that the spouse is not the owner of another house.</p>

      the status and role of archaeologists within the proposals for changes in the heritage service; if the Government is committed to an integrated heritage service as the most efficient and effective way of protecting built and natural heritage; if it is proposed to retain these functions in one Department; and if the post of chief archaeologist is to be retained when the present incumbent retires.

The archaeological service provided by my Department will continue with the exception of the professional inputs on State owned national monuments. Responsibility for management of those  properties is transferring to the Office of Public Works and in-house archaeological expertise to care for the monuments is being addressed in the transfer arrangements. The Departments chief archaeologist has recently retired and the filling of the post is being addressed at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1972">The person concerned applied for  carer's benefit on 7 January 2003. The principal conditions for receipt of the benefit are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided, and certain PRSI conditions are satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_1973">His application was refused on the grounds that full-time care and attention was not required in this case. He was notified of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 5 February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1974">Additional medical evidence was subsequently received and, together with the original medical report, was submitted to the chief medical adviser for further consideration. This evidence did not change the original decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1975">The person concerned has appealed this decision and his case has been forwarded to the social welfare appeals office for determination. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1977">Under social welfare regulations, carer's allowance and retirement pension are not payable concurrently.
