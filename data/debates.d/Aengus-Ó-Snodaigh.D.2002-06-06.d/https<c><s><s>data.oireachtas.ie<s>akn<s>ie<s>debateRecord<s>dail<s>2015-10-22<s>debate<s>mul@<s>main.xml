            <p eId="para_2">What contingency plans are being put in place by the Minister for Health in the event of an overrun in the health budget in 2016 and will he make a statement on the matter? This leads from the point that next year there will be different fiscal rules applicable to Departments in the context of supplementary budgets. This year the Minister for Health has a €600 million budget deficit. Other than a sum of €280 million, no additional funding was allocated to the Minister for 2016 in last week's budget. The health service will be commencing 2016 under-resourced and underfunded. What contingency plans is the Minister putting in place in view of the fact that, as we know, he will have insufficient funding for the health services in 2016?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">Since my appointment as Minister for Health, I have sought to put in place a realistic budget for health and social care. Improved budgetary parameters reflecting the growing strength of the economy have enabled me to secure additional funds for health and social care in 2015 and 2016. The gross current Estimate for the health sector for 2016 is €13.175 billion, an increase of €880 million on the Revised Estimate for 2015. In addition, potential savings of €125 million will be available to reinvest in maintaining and improving health services. While I welcome the increase in funding for the health services in 2016, I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of safe and efficient health services against a backdrop of growing needs. It is essential that we continue to focus on cost containment, productivity and efficiencies as there continues to be major cost pressures on the health service due to an increase in our aging population, the incidence of chronic conditions and the cost of new and expensive medicines, treatments and technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> I also recognise the need to strengthen accountability and good governance across the health service. The HSE has an accountability framework which makes explicit the responsibilities of all managers to achieve the performance targets set out in each year's service plan. Where areas of underperformance are identified, the matter is escalated according to an escalation and intervention process. The HSE’s 2016 national service plan will detail how the executive intends to develop and build on the accountability framework in 2016 to further enhance and strengthen accountability arrangements next year. The HSE will also engage in internal efforts to maximise savings and opportunities for cost containment and ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to mitigate any projected deficits.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">My Department will continue to work closely with the HSE to ensure that the greatest degree of budgetary control is exercised. Ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials of my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure, will continue to be enhanced as required in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> New EU fiscal rules limit the amount of Government expenditure in any year. Therefore, any overruns need to be funded by new revenue measures, or reallocating funds from elsewhere. This is likely to mean, in practice, reduced scope to allocate additional money to Departments by way of a Supplementary Estimate at year end. Accordingly, the planning and management of health expenditure will be subject to particular attention in finalising the 2016 national service plan.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">Straight away, the abdication of responsibility continues, because the Minister is saying his Department will work closely with the HSE. The bottom line is that it is the Minister who will present the Estimates and who is charged with seeking enough funding for the HSE national service plan that will be published in early 2016. The bottom line, to date, is that the Minister has said one of his overarching goals was to achieve a realistic budget for the health services. There is a €600 million hole in the budget for this year. That is hardly realistic. That is a massive deficit by any stretch of the imagination. It was foretold this time last year when everybody effectively said the Minister did not have enough money to run the health services in 2015. Form would indicate that what he has been allocated this year for next year simply is not a credible starting point. Therefore, he will have huge difficulties this time next year in trying to ensure he has enough money to maintain basic health services, bearing in mind the huge pressures on the health service at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_9">There are massive waiting lists, overcrowding in emergency departments and a lack of capital investment across many of our hospitals, so there are huge problems out there and the demographics on top of that. We already know we do not have enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_10">I am not sure that in health there will ever be enough money to do everything one would like to do, but we have a very substantial budget and there should be enough to maintain the existing level of service and improve it in some instances. To clarify, the €600 million Supplementary Estimate this year does not fill a hole. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I sought much of that money during the year to make particular policy decisions, including more community beds, more hospital beds, a reduction of the fair deal waiting list to four weeks, and the provision of GP care to everyone under six years and everyone over 70 years. I would not like people to be under the misapprehension that all of that is somehow an overrun. It is not. Policy decisions were made during the year, supported by Government, to do more than we had planned to do at the start of the year. In respect of the €600 million being carried over into next year, that is not all recurring expenses; some of it involves one-off payments that will not recur next year. For example, the symphysiotomy payments scheme would be part of that. Not all the €600 million has to be paid again next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_12">There is the additional €280 million and the €125 million in savings. In the budget proposal from the party opposite, it proposed an additional €380 million for health but did not make any provision for the Lansdowne Road agreement. Assuming the party opposite does not intend to renege on that, it is providing €280 million, which is pretty much the same as we have provided, so obviously it must believe it is adequate.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">The difficulty with all of this is that, as we stand here today raising issues and asking Dáil questions, there is overcrowding in emergency departments across the country and massive waiting lists. The Minister has changed the targets for inpatient and outpatient appointments to 18 months. There are cancellations on a continued basis for elective surgeries. Right across the health service there is huge pressure, which is having an impact on the quality of life of patients and putting the workforce under extreme and inordinate pressure. Last year, for example, the Minister said he would have €300 million in non-Exchequer income, but he will not have that income next year. That is not continuing income; much of it was one-off funding. Irrespective of what way the Minister wishes to put it, he will have a deficit this time next year again. If not, it will mean that services will have been cut back to remain within budget. The Minister should confront that reality now and accept that the budget for 2016 is unrealistic and simply will not sustain the health services of today, which are under-resourced and under-funded.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">Almost entirely, the one-off income requirements are provided for. If the Deputy wishes to add €270 million to the €600 million and to the €280 million he can. We actually managed to have the one-off payments resolved this year. If one adds up the figures, they amount to more than €1 billion. Elective surgery is cancelled more frequently than we would wish, but the cancellation rate is 1%. I pointed to the pre-budget submission from the Deputy's party which provides for an extra €380 million for health and, perhaps, knocking €100 million off that for the Lansdowne Road agreement. Is the Deputy telling me that in his party's pre-budget submission it provided inadequately for health, as the amount provided is pretty much the same as what we have provided?</p>

            <p eId="para_16">Why would the Deputy's party provide an inadequate amount for health? The Deputy is accusing the Government of doing pretty much exactly what his party put in its own pre-budget submission.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">I seek to establish the current status of preparation of the new dental Bill. Why it has taken so long to prepare and present? Is the Minister aware of concerns about the registration of all the different professional roles within the overall dental health care team and the intended roles and responsibilities of the Dental Council on the enactment of the new legislation - that is, in relation to registration, responsibility and oversight, and, specifically, the power to inspect premises? These are the matters I wish to see addressed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_19">Work is ongoing on the preparation of a new dental Bill. It is based on a comprehensive public consultation process which informed the key policy issues that are now shaping the drafting of the Bill. The Bill will bring about significant change in fitness to practice, regulation, registration and the constitution of the Dental Council. The legislation will provide for the regulation and inspection of dental practices by the Dental Council. These proposals also ensure modernisation of the legislation regarding governance of the council, specified functions of council, education and training and continuous professional development. A regulatory impact analysis is also under way. There is no row-back on the registration of allied dental professions. It is proposed that those allied dental professions whose scope of practise has been determined by the Dental Council as being suitable for independent practice will have mandatory registration and be made subject to fitness to practice. The council will make this determination based on its assessment of the level and nature of the risk posed to patient safety. </p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Allied dental professions not determined by the council as being suitable for independent practice will not have mandatory registration. However, the Dental Council may introduce rules to regulate the training and education standards and to protect the titles of these professions. It will be an offence for a person to falsely present as having the approved education and training standard or to falsely use a protected title. </p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Over the last number of years, the Department has updated the legislation for doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and 14 health and social care professionals. This has provided for greater accountability and comprehensive regulatory governance of these professions. It was a major body of legislative work. The experience of this, and of implementing these revised arrangements, will inform the Department's consideration of priorities for further legislation in the area of professional regulation. This includes the drafting of the new dental Bill during the course of 2016. Department officials are also currently committed to drafting a priority health (miscellaneous provisions) Bill. The primary purpose of this is to amend all health profession regulator Acts as a consequence of the transposition into Irish law by January 2016 of the modernised professionals qualification directive.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_15">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">The Minister of State has not explained why there is such a delay in the presentation of this new legislation. The existing Dental Act 1985 is 30 years old. When the Minister of State makes the point in relation to the Dental Council and allied dental health professions and, specifically, those who an practice independently, she is failing to take on board the Dental Council's own very clear position in respect of this matter and the registration of all those who make up the dental health care team. Appearing before the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 8 October, Dr. Eamon Croke, the president of the Dental Council, said the Dental Council believes that all members of the dental health care team should undergo mandatory registration, with the Dental Council making no distinction between those who can practice independently and those in other areas of responsibility, such as dental nurses, hygienists and dental technicians.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">If what the Minister of State is talking about is to proceed, it would be only dentists and clinical dental technicians who would be required to register and this is simply not enough. Can the Minister revisit this matter?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_16" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_24">That is not what we are saying. What we are saying is that those who will be deemed fit to have an independent practice will have mandatory registration but I do think it is important. This area is as subject to change as anything else. The issue of the proportionality of regulation is being examined in the UK and Europe. The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care in the UK recently published a paper rethinking regulation which emphasises the need to apply "right touch" regulation to the regulation of health and care services in the UK. It cautions about the need to be aware of what regulation can and cannot do to contain risk and that statutory registration is not always the most effective approach. We should be conscious of that happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> The reason for the delay is that there was a wide consultation process. Oral health is not just about dentists, as the Deputy rightly points out, and there were other players in the field who needed to be consulted. That happened over a long period.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">I strongly disagree. The professional regulation unit's notes relating to this matter from August 2015 refer to allied dental health professions who are not allowed to practise independently, which is everyone other than dentists, orthodontists and clinical dental technicians. It is important that the Minister of State understands that while not registering the professions, the Dental Council may introduce rules, etc. It is critically important that it is recognised that not only Dr. Croke but the entire panel which came before us, including the board members and representatives of the Dublin Dental Hospital, indicated very clearly that they want mandatory registration across the board for the very sound reason that once one registers and regulates an area, standards improve and one has authority across the board. I am asking for a re-evaluation so that not only the independent practitioners I have named but those who are the allied support professions within the overall dental health care team, including dental technicians, dental nurses, hygienists and others, are under mandatory registration. That is very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> In respect of the powers to inspect, will the Minister of State clarify whether, after the enactment of the new legislation, the Dental Council will have the power to inspect and close illegal practices in the public interest because that has not happened heretofore?</p>

            <p eId="para_28">That is the reason there will be a new dental Bill and the council will have those powers. All the other professions that have been registered up to this point have had power under the fitness to practise area and this is a significant power. In looking at all the other regulatory bodies in respect of fitness to practise, I am not sure that each registration council needs such a body on its own. We may take a look at centralising that but fitness to practise will be central to what the council will do. It will come about in most cases through complaints from the public but in other cases through the council's inspections. We need to wait and see what the Bill will propose and I have every faith in our Chief Dental Officer because she is very familiar with the area and has taken all of the issues raised by the Deputy on board.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">Along with other acute hospitals, University Hospital Waterford has prepared a capacity plan to help address the expected increased demand for services this winter. Measures include opening additional beds as required, managing patient flow, appropriate discharges, internal surge capacity both in terms of beds and staff and prioritising diagnostics for inpatients to facilitate earlier discharge.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> In addition, University Hospital Waterford and HSE community services will put a community intervention team in place by December for the Waterford region. This is a nurse-led team which works with other health professionals and services in an effort to provide a rapid response for certain patients with an acute illness episode. Such patients require short interventions, usually under 72 hours, in the community or at home such as blood monitoring, fluids or IV. The availability of the specialist team will, I expect, reduce hospital attendance and enable some patients to be discharged earlier. </p>
            <p eId="para_33"> University Hospital Waterford has an average of 15 delayed discharges. The hospital works closely with HSE community services so that patients are discharged as quickly as possible to appropriate accommodation. Suitable patients on the delayed discharge list are prioritised for home care packages. The hospital also works with community and ambulance services to ensure that weekend discharges are facilitated. While the additional supports provided to University Hospital Waterford do not include additional acute beds under recent proposals, 48 extra beds will be available across the South-South West Hospital Group. </p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The community nursing unit project at St. Patrick's Hospital is a priority project. A design review was completely recently. At this stage, it is expected that the planning application could be submitted before the end of the year. </p>

            <p eId="para_35">I try not to be critical but the Government is failing to deal with the most basic need of a human being when he or she reports ill to a hospital. This is giving them the dignity of a bed in which to receive treatment. As the main hospital in the south-east region, University Hospital Waterford serves a population of about 500,000. Going on figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's trolley watch, its emergency department is frequently one of the most overcrowded hospitals in the country. The figures are reaching new highs. The most recent data shows a massive 278% increase in the number of patients waiting on trolleys in September. Over one weekend alone last month, the accident and emergency department reached full capacity and ambulances had to be diverted to Wexford and Kilkenny, a journey of one hour from Waterford city. I do not need to impress on the Minister the difference an hour can make when somebody is ill, be they critically ill or otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> In recent weeks, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has made claims that due to the recruitment ban, patient care at Waterford has been severely compromised. I want to hear the Minister's view about what the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has said and trolley watch. Does he accept that there has been a 278% increase in the number of patients waiting on beds and that patient care at the hospital is being severely compromised? </p>

            <p eId="para_37">Like all emergency departments or certainly all major emergency departments, the emergency department at University Hospital Waterford experiences overcrowding and this has increased this year. Nobody is denying that. It is worth pointing out that of all the major city hospitals, Waterford performs the best in terms of overcrowding. There are eight people on trolleys in the hospital this morning, four of whom have been on trolleys for more than nine hours. This is the lowest of all the major hospitals. St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital are next on ten but there are other hospitals with 20 and 30. Waterford is actually a good performer in that regard. This is down to very competent and excellent staff in the emergency department, a good consultant team and good management at the hospital. This should be recognised. We are always beating people up in the health service. Where a hospital performs relatively well, it should be recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> There is no recruitment embargo. Obviously, hospitals cannot hire willy-nilly but the recruitment embargo was lifted quite some time ago. This is why we have nearly 4,000 more staff in the health service than we had this time last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">The hospital group is open to any proposals to provide additional beds. It seems that what would work most effectively and quickly for Waterford hospital is the establishment of the community intervention team, which I hope the Deputy will welcome, which is a team of nurses who visit people's homes to check their bloods, give medicines and fluids, including intravenously, thereby enabling people to leave hospital sooner or avoid going there in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Minister's response is interesting. The nurses I met at University Hospital Waterford the day before yesterday told me that the biggest stumbling block to the opening of additional beds to ease the chronic overcrowding is the ongoing staffing crisis. According to those nurses wards are understaffed and they are unable to meet the total needs of their patients. The INMO estimates that Waterford hospital is operating at approximately 120% capacity without the appropriate nursing staff in place. Will the Minister sanction a special needs incentive to recruit nursing staff at Waterford hospital immediately? Will he sanction, as previously requested, the appointment of an additional community discharge nurse at weekends for University Hospital Waterford?</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> The Minister has referred to the possibility of the private sector being utilised to cope with overcrowding. Is this planned for Waterford in the winter, particularly for elderly people in the community who are frightened and need reassurance that if they present at the hospital over the winter they will not be left on a trolley or chair, in some cases for up to 16 or 17 hours, which, as I said, is undignified and unacceptable in a western country in 2015-2016?</p>

            <p eId="para_56">In line with the programme for Government, my priority as Minister has been to modernise our mental health services and to prioritise new resources to underpin the implementation of A Vision for Change<i>, </i>something that should have been done when we had lots of money but was not<i>.</i> Despite severe financial pressures, the Government has provided additional ring-fenced mental health funding of €125 million between 2012 and end 2015. The additional €20 million provided for mental health in 2014 must be seen in the context of the overall additional ring-fenced funding for mental health since 2012. This amount was considered appropriate given the challenge in recruiting staff to new posts, which has improved since then. The overall additional ring-fenced funding since 2012 represents a significant investment, facilitating the prioritised development and reconfiguration of community mental health teams for adults, children and adolescents. The funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness and people with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services, enhancement of access to counselling and psychotherapy in primary care and for suicide prevention measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The details of the 2016 budget will be finalised with the HSE in the context of approval of its 2016 national service plan, which will also outline the total amount of funding for all services, including mental health services, in 2016. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, an additional €35 million will be provided in 2016 to accelerate the pace of change to develop a modern, patient-centred and recovery-orientated mental health service. This means that despite serious resource pressures overall, the Government will provide funding of €160 million up to the end of 2016, which has been specifically earmarked for new developments in mental health and suicide prevention. This will enable the HSE to continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change<i>.</i></p>

            <p eId="para_58">This question arises out of an exchange between the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, with Dr. Sara Burke at a recent press conference at which time the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, when asked about the mental health budget said that because it had not been decided yet and there were dynamic figures, they needed to work it out. He also said that they were within the range. The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, commented to the effect that the commitment to mental health is for €35 million every year for the lifetime of the Government. Can we take it as a given that €35 million is being provided under budget 2016? The Minister of State might when responding to that question comment on the position on the 2014 shortfall of €15 million. It is debatable whether €35 million was provided in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Let us start afresh. The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has given a commitment today that €35 million will be provided in 2016.

            <p eId="para_61">The reason only €20 million was provided in 2014 was because of the significant difficulties experienced in recruitment, not only in the mental health service area but across a range of areas. We were in the lucky position of being able to recruit because we were provided with the funding to do so and because we got sanction to breach the moratorium. Unfortunately, because the overall context of recruitment in terms of health was down, we were unable to spend the €35 million. It is as simple as that. I did not jump up and down about it, as it were, because I was aware of the difficulties being experienced in the recruitment phase. We are now having more traction in recruitment such that the €35 million allocation for this year will be spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> It is important to point out that the focus for the next year will be on old age psychiatry, which sadly has been neglected, and counselling in primary care, which is where most people present. We need to focus our attention on what can be done to stop people having to present at the more acute services and that is what we will do. The counselling in primary care service, CIPC, which was hugely successful last year in terms of counselling for adults, will be developed for people under 18 years.</p>

In the HSE service plan the recruitment of staff was deliberately time delayed because of cuts in mental health service budgets. The Minister of State cannot have it both ways. The difficulties in recruiting arose because somebody made a policy decision not to recruit. That is the difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> The Minister of State, in responding to a question from me over the course of the summer, said that we were 2,900 staff short of the full implementation of A Vision for Change. In 2011, we had a solid commitment on ring-fenced funding on current expenditure. Is the Minister of State satisfied that over the course of the past four years, €35 million per annum was successfully secured? What has been the cumulative current expenditure impact of that with respect to the 2,900 whole-time equivalents?</p>

            <p eId="para_69">On budget day the Minister referred to ambulance service improvements and indicated there would be additional funding, but he did not provide significant detail on that. Will he inform us now whether the mid-west can expect to get additional resources for the recruitment of staff and the provision of new vehicles? As he knows, there has been significant reconfiguration of acute services in the mid-west and, as a result, investment is required in the ambulance system and service. The reconfiguration process received widespread support but it was accepted on the basis there would be a consequent investment in the ambulance service. There is a problem in this regard. There is a shortage of staff and a difficulty with ambulances. Will the Minister enlighten us about funding for this need and when he expects it will happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">A significant and ongoing reform programme has been under way in recent years in the National Ambulance Service and considerable advances have been made in 2015. In particular, the opening of the new national emergency operations centre in Tallaght and the establishment of the single national control system, which is now fully operational, will help to achieve improvements in ambulance control and dispatch performance throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> In recent years, the National Ambulance Service has changed and modernised its model of service delivery. It is no longer considered appropriate for an ambulance station to provide services only in its own local area. For this reason the ambulance service is moving to dynamic deployment where all resources in a region are deployed across that region as a single fleet in response to demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> Among significant improvements to pre-hospital services in recent times is the emergency aeromedical support service, EAS, which the Government has established on a permanent basis. Since its introduction in 2012, the EAS, from its base in Athlone, has completed almost 1,200 missions for time critical and seriously ill patients, including those in the mid-west. In addition, the development of the intermediate care service, which is based in Limerick, provides vital support to the hospitals in the region, allowing patients to move to the most appropriate facility for the treatment they need.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> In 2016, we will build on these improvements through the provision of additional resources to the National Ambulance Service. While I have no doubt that the mid-west will benefit from the additional resources, I am not in a position at this stage to give specific details in regard to any particular region. The details of the plan for all HSE services, including the ambulance service, will be outlined in the national service plan together with the allocation of existing and new resources. I can confirm that provision will be made for an increased ambulance service staffing intake and the expansion of community first responder schemes. Developments nationally will also be influenced by the National Ambulance Service independent capacity review, which will help to determine current and future service needs. Areas being examined include staff numbers and skill mix as well as resources and deployment locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I note the Minister is not in a position to provide specific details on the mid-west. I can help in that regard. In Clare alone, there is a shortage of approximately 20 staff and some vehicles are quite poor and need replacement. For that reason alone, I ask the Minister to use his influence for the development of the service plan for ambulance provision over the coming months. Will he ensure an additional staffing component of 20 for Clare and provide whatever other resources are needed in the mid-west generally? I call for this on the basis that the public representatives and the people of the region have accepted in principle, and to a large extent in whole, the reconfiguration of services from places like St. John's Hospital in Limerick, Ennis Hospital and Nenagh Hospital to the acute facility in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> This was a hard-won battle. It took a lot to convince people it was in their best interests and in the best interests of patient safety and outcomes. However, contingent on that acceptance was the expectation there would be a fit-for-purpose and fully staffed ambulance service fully provided for with appropriate ambulances. This has not happened to date. I appeal to the Minister in a non-partisan way to ensure the regions that have accepted the principle of reconfiguration get the appropriate investment in their ambulance service.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">The budget of the National Ambulance Service will be increased for next year and was increased by approximately €5 million this year. Additional ambulances will be purchased, but how the funding and ambulances will be spread out by region throughout the country is up to the National Ambulance Service and I will be guided by its advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> Deputy Dooley's point is valid and well made. Where reconfiguration has occurred - something we want to do in other parts of the country as well - it is difficult to maintain public confidence if there is not a good ambulance service. It is important to improve ambulance services where reconfiguration occurs. His point is valid for the midlands and north east also and I will take it on board.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">I appreciate the Minister's commitment to reconfiguration. One of the main concerns around the reconfiguration process was that the benefits to the system would be realised, but that the potential upside for the patient would not in terms of the provision of ambulance cover. I am confident the Minister understands reconfiguration, but I am not sure the mandarins in the Department of Finance fully embrace and understand what is involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> I welcome the Minister's commitment to engage with the ambulance service. I, along with Deputy Pat Breen, had an opportunity to visit that facility yesterday and the Minister is correct that a fantastic service is in place. I fully accept and understand the need for the dynamic deployment of ambulances. This is welcome but the service still requires a significant level of investment in staffing. It is often said by Ministers that there has been an increase in staff or that a Department intends to take on more staff, but that fails to recognise that people retire. What is important is that additional staff are required over and above those needed to replace those who retire.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> We need is to improve the average age of vehicles in order that the fleet is more modern. If that happened, we would not have situations like those we have had in the mid west, particularly Clare, where one or two vehicles have broken down, creating trauma for families. In a particular case, a person died on the roadside, and although that was not because the ambulance broke down, it played a part in the trauma. Such incidents do not do anything to add to confidence in the reconfiguration process.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">Rather unusually, I received a response from the hospital group before this question came up in the House. That is not always the way. From August to September there has been a 75% increase in the number of outpatients waiting longer than 18 months at Mayo General Hospital. There seems to be specific pressure on the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, figures in regard to dermatology, general medicine, nephrology, ENT and urology. What plans are in place to deal with this problem and does the Minister envisage any extra resources for the hospital?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_84">In January, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times of 18 months for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments by the end of June and of 15 months by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> In September, the number of outpatients waiting more than 18 months was 427 for Mayo General Hospital. As the Deputy points out, this represents, unfortunately, an increase over the August figures. However, it does represent an improvement of 120 on the January figures. In January, there had been 547 patients waiting more than 18 months. The figure dipped mid year, but has risen again, but not to as high a figure as at the start of the year. The hospital has confirmed that it is focusing on specific specialties and timeframes based on national targets and that it expects to achieve a maximum waiting time of 15 months by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> The HSE has provided additional funding of €51 million this year to ensure these maximum waiting times are achieved by all hospitals. This funding is intended to maximise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time. In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 14-month maxima of 99.6% for inpatient day cases and 92% for outpatients.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> Concerted efforts have been made to reduce outpatient waiting lists overall by facilitating additional clinics outside conventional working hours and outsourcing where capacity is limited. The success of this approach is evident nationally, with the reduction of more than 4,300 in the overall outpatient waiting lists in the six weeks to the end of September. Approximately 4,620 outpatient appointments are being provided by mid-November, specifically for those waiting 15 months and more.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">We are very proud of the work that goes on at Mayo General Hospital but it seems to be under pressure on many different fronts at the moment, in particular in regard to accident and emergency and surgery. Of the €51 million mentioned by the Minister, how much was allocated to Mayo General Hospital in the past 11 months? The Minister said earlier that 4,000 extra staff have been appointed to the health service in the past 12 months. How many of those have gone to Mayo General Hospital?</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> What is the role of the hospital groups in this context? With regard to Saolta, in the Minister's view, is there enough engagement between the various components of the hospital groups towards dealing with this on a cross-hospital basis as opposed to an individual-hospital basis? I am aware of one recent case where a person was brought to the hospital in regard to a condition but declined to be treated by the specific consultant attached to Mayo General Hospital and opted for a consultant who was part of University Hospital Galway, and that person had to make their own arrangements. Surely, with a hospital group, that could have been done on a group-wide basis. It suggests to me that, perhaps, the group concept is not working the way we want it to.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> If an appointment is scheduled and the hospital cancels the appointment, does this count as an appointment taken off the waiting list and then put onto a new timeframe or a new waiting list?</p>

            <p eId="para_91">I do not know the answer to that question for sure but I would assume that if the hospital cancels the appointment, the person retains the same position on the waiting list as they would have had previously. That is what I would expect to be the case, although I will have to double-check it. It would be unusual if anything else were being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> I do not have the exact staff figures for Mayo but I can get my office to send them on to Deputy Calleary since they are available. Like all the hospital groups, Saolta hospital group is relatively new. Saolta is one of the more developed ones, having a directorate across the hospitals, which seems to be working quite well. Needless to say, all the hospital groups are relatively new and need further development over the next year or so.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">Currently there is no dedicated obstetrics theatre at Kerry General Hospital and mothers who need surgery while in labour must use the regular theatres. If a theatre is not available, they must wait, which is a particular difficulty in emergency cases, for example, where a caesarean section is required immediately. In that scenario, where a baby may be in distress, those involved simply cannot afford to wait. There is a continued risk of catastrophic brain injuries and other related complications as a result of not having the dedicated theatre. I acknowledge the Minister visited the hospital earlier this year, at my request. I would like to have an update on the request for this very much needed infrastructure for the hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">Much is being done to improve maternity services further across the country. Additional funding of €2 million, provided in 2015, is being used to fill front-line posts. In 2016, the HSE will again focus on maternity service improvements and implement managed clinical maternity networks across all hospital groups. The establishment of such networks will ensure that smaller maternity units, like Kerry, will be supported to provide high quality, safe services. An example of this initiative which was recently established is the memorandum of understanding agreed between the Coombe Hospital and the HSE to establish a managed maternity network within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. This will provide a single maternity service operating over two sites, led by the Coombe. This arrangement will serve as a model for other hospital groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> We now have more midwives employed than ever before in the State, 1,438, which is an increase of 228 since 2011. Similarly, there has been an increase of five consultant gynaecologist and obstetricians, which represents an increase of 10.94 whole-time equivalents.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> The HSE is also establishing a national women and infants health programme, modelled on the successful national cancer control programme. The programme will span obstetrics, gynaecology and neonatal services across community, primary and secondary care. This represents a fundamental reorganisation of maternity service governance structures and will, I hope, ensure the delivery of safe, high quality and sustainable maternity services. A recruitment campaign for the programme’s management team, comprising a programme manager, a clinical director and a director of midwifery has commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> In addition, my Department is currently developing the country's first national maternity strategy. This will provide a policy framework for the women and infants programme and strategic direction for the optimal development of maternity services to ensure that women have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs. I have identified the publication of the strategy as a priority for this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> Additional funding is being made available for the further development of maternity services in 2016. The use of this funding to develop the quality and safety of maternity services further will be finalised in the coming weeks in the context of the HSE's national service plan for 2016. I am aware that staffing requirements for a dedicated obstetric theatre have been identified by Kerry General Hospital and this will be considered by the HSE in finalising priorities for the 2016 service plan.</p>

I urge the Minister to use any influence he has to prioritise this matter, which is one of huge importance to County Kerry and all of the women who are using the maternity services and their families. I have an interest in this as someone who has been in the maternity ward of Kerry General Hospital twice in the last two and a half years. I highly commend the efforts of the very dedicated staff and the brilliant work they do. However, they need support and need the Government and the HSE to help ensure there are no other very sad cases as, unfortunately, have occurred in the past. We need to do everything we possibly can to ensure this does not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the many developments that have occurred at the hospital under the current Government in recent years, such as the new endoscopy unit, the new cardiology unit, the new medical assessment unit, the four-bed, high observation unit, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will be aware-----</p>

            <p eId="para_110">Improving timely access to care is a key priority for the Government which is why, in January, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times of 18 months by the end of June and 15 months by year-end for routine appointments. In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18-month maximum waiting time for outpatients of 92%. In September, there was a slight increase in the number of patients waiting over 18 months for an outpatient appointment in both Naas and Tallaght hospitals. However, the overall number of patients on outpatient waiting lists in both hospitals actually fell during this period. Less than 1% of the total number of patients on the outpatient waiting lists in these two hospitals are waiting over 18 months, while almost 90% are waiting less than 12 months in Naas and 75% are waiting less than 12 months in Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> I want to assure the Deputy that the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group is actively engaging with the hospitals to support them in addressing capacity issues in specific specialties. Concerted efforts have been made to reduce outpatient waiting times nationally by facilitating additional clinics outside conventional working hours and outsourcing where capacity is limited. As an example of the volume of work which is ongoing at present, over 58,000 outpatient appointments are being provided in the next six weeks. Approximately 4,620 outpatient appointments are being provided by mid-November, specifically for those waiting 15 months and over. During that same period, almost 20,250 patients from the waiting lists will undergo an inpatient or day-case procedure or scope.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">It is difficult to be reassured by the Minister's response. According to the statistics from August, 1,001 patients had been waiting for 18 months or longer in Tallaght. By September, that number had risen to 1,215, an increase of 21%. In August in Naas, just 12 people had been waiting for 18 months or longer. By September, that number had risen to 41, an increase of 241%. Why is this happening on the Minister's watch? In particular, why are there problems with urology, orthopaedics and dermatology in Tallaght hospital? Is it a staffing issue? Have we an inadequate number of specialists in place to deal with demand at these hospitals? Has the Minister identified where the problem lies and what will he do about it?</p>

            <p eId="para_113">What has happened at Naas is similar to what has happened in other hospitals, in that there was a waiting list initiative to ensure that no one was waiting for longer than 18 months for a routine appointment. That initiative was delivered successfully in almost all hospitals across the State by July. By August and September, though, people had breached the 18-month period again. That is why additional finance has been provided to undertake the initiative again and to target in particular people who have been waiting for longer than 15 months for routine appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> I am not involved in the day-to-day management of Tallaght hospital. It is a statutory hospital with its own board and CEO. It is short a number of specialists and is experiencing difficulties with space for clinics and with capacity in general.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">We know that the Minister is not personally responsible for the management of Tallaght hospital, but the situation there is a disgrace. Only University Hospital Galway had more people waiting in September and nearly one in ten people on the national list of those who have been waiting for 18 months or longer is in Tallaght. It is fine to comment on and identify these matters, but what the public wants is something to be done about them.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> When discussing health, Deputies and politicians more generally often refer to millions of euro being spent, numbers of patients on waiting lists and percentages. The reality is that we are referring to human beings who, in many instances, are enduring suffering, pain and loss of participation in society and work because of these delays, which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">The increase in the number of outpatients waiting for longer than 18 months at Tallaght is largely due to capacity pressures in certain specialties relating mainly to medical manpower pressures as a result of consultant retirements, maternity and sick leave and the inability to recruit locums into those positions. However, it should be noted that, overall, the 18-month target is being achieved and exceeded by the majority of medical and surgical specialties in the hospital. On 30 January, 4,082 people were waiting for 18 months or longer. By the end of September, this figure had decreased to 1,407. Continued efforts are being made to reduce that to zero by the end of the year.</p>

The call centre seems to be working well. There has been a doubling in the number of nurses applying to register this year, which may surprise people who constantly hear the contrary narrative. The number of nurses seeking to register - those who are newly graduated, from overseas or returning to Ireland - has increased by 122%, which has put the board under a great deal of pressure.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">The national dementia strategy was launched in December 2014. It delivers on a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community-based services.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the strategy over the 2014-17 period. This implementation programme represents a combined investment of €27.5 million, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing €12 million and the HSE €15.5 million. Key elements of the initiative include the roll-out of a programme of intensive home supports and home care packages for people with dementia, valued at €22 million over a three-year period; the provision of an additional dementia-specific resource, valued at €1.2 million, for general practitioners, GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points; and measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia, valued at €2.7 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> A national office for dementia, which was the key request from Atlantic Philanthropies, has been established within the HSE to co-ordinate the implementation of the strategy. Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from intensive home care packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. Work on the design of a programme of education and training in dementia care for primary care teams and GPs has commenced and is being led, the Deputy will be glad to hear, from UCC in conjunction with DCU and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP. Work has also begun on a dementia awareness campaign, entitled "Dementia Friendly Ireland", which is being led by the HSE's health and well-being division. A monitoring group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the national dementia strategy. This group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates. It also includes someone living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia. It is an extensive programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">We welcome everything that has been done, but if one considered the demographics and the projected trends in Alzheimer's and dementia, one would see a trebling in the incidence of both in just a generation. That will be a major demand on resources. Even in the context of the national dementia strategy, I do not believe that enough planning is being done to provide the resources that will be required. We know what will be necessary in the years ahead, given the increasing prevalence.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> Intensive home care packages represent a key issue. Atlantic Philanthropies is involved in their funding, but we need to put in place proper systems with seamless supports in the community. We discuss primary care and community care, but families do not have the supports that they deserve. We should start being imaginative in the strategy as regards how we care for Alzheimer's or dementia sufferers in a community or home care setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">That involves community-based services and voluntary organisations all coming together to deal with what will be an avalanche. If we do not have the resources in place, we will deny very many people basic dignity.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">I agree with the Deputy. Planning, including evidence-based planning, and research are key to all of this. The combination of both the delivery of services within communities and research will give us the tools we will need to deliver what is essential. The Alzheimer Society of Ireland was the key driver in all of this and the conduit between Atlantic Philanthropies and the Government in terms of how we would put this package in place. It delivers an incredible service to its clients on behalf of the Government. Everyone I know who has used it raves about it. I agree that we need to know what is coming down the track and what we will need to ensure people can stay increasingly within their own communities. We should be glad that the leading clinician in all of this is Dr. Tony Foley from Kinsale. He is leading the whole project in terms of the community-based delivery of services for those with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. We are well on the way to knowing what we will need in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">One way of showing a continuing commitment would be increase the number of intensive home care packages for 2016 in the context of the HSE service plan. We know from all the empirical evidence and the collation of data that the prevalence of the conditions will increase dramatically in the years ahead. By any stretch of the imagination, we do not have the supports or infrastructure in place to deal with them currently. There needs to be a ramping up of investment to meet the demands outlined in the national dementia strategy. I am reluctant to applaud until we see some firm commitments in the HSE's service plan, for example, in the area of intensive home care packages, and a broadening of community-based supports in conjunction with the primary care strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">I do not believe we are disagreeing but that we need to be cautious about ensuring what we are doing and proposing are actually working. That is essential. What we are doing right now is working but it needs to be bedded in. We need to be absolutely certain that this is what we need and that it is where we need it. That is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> Having come through the process in which it was said there would be a pensions time bomb and that all would be doom and gloom, I believe conditions change based on research. Both the numbers and direction in which one goes can be changed. I am very hopeful because I know research in this area is very active. From time to time, I see signs of breakthroughs that are very encouraging. There is a need for a combination of approaches rather than a single pathway.</p>

            <p eId="para_138">In January, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by the end of June and 15 months by the year's end. I refer to routine appointments, not urgent or emergency appointments. It was always made clear that, for some specialities, this would not be possible due to a lack of capacity in both the public and private sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> The HSE was provided with additional funding of €51 million to ensure these maximum waiting times are achieved. The funding provided is intended to maximise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time. In June, the HSE reported performances against the 18-month maximum waiting time of 99.6% for inpatient and day cases and 92% for outpatients.</p>
            <p eId="para_140"> Concerted efforts have been made to reduce outpatient waiting lists by facilitating additional clinics outside conventional working hours and outsourcing where capacity is limited. The success of this approach is evident with the reduction of over 4,300 in the overall outpatient waiting lists in the six weeks to the end of September. An example of the volume of the ongoing work is that over 58,000 outpatient appointments are being provided in the next six weeks. Approximately 4,620 outpatient appointments are being provided by mid-November, specifically for those waiting 15 months and over. During that same period, almost 20,250 patients from the waiting lists will undergo an inpatient or day case procedure or scope under the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> As of 30 September 2015, there has been a reduction of 11,671 in the number waiting more than 18 months for an outpatient appointment. Addressing the longest waiting periods for treatment is a key performance objective for the remainder of 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">At the start of 2015, the Minister abandoned his predecessor's targets of a maximum waiting time of 18 months for inpatient day case appointments and one year for outpatient appointments. There is no point in pretending in this Chamber that circumstances have improved. The Minister has moved the goalposts and has set diminishing expectations. Charles Dickens' novel <i>Great Expectations</i> comes to mind. If it were about the Minister's tenure, it would be called <i>Diminishing Expectations</i>. Creating diminishing expectations is what the Minister has been doing consistently. Every target set by his predecessor has been moved to make it look better but the bottom line is that people are still waiting for inordinate periods. For the Minister to applaud himself for moving the goalposts and deeming it acceptable for people to have to wait 15 months or 18 months for various appointments is simply not credible any more. The statistics show that 64,985 people are waiting for more than a year for an appointment and that 4,476 of these are for the National Children's Hospital. Behind the Minister's statistics are individuals who are waiting for inordinate periods. While the Minister is saying the statistics do not include emergency appointments, he should realise each case is an emergency for the individual concerned. The patients would at least like a timely appointment with the consultant in terms of diagnostics.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">Every month, the authorities report waiting times based on three-month intervals, making reference to those waiting for fewer than three months, those waiting for between three and six months, those waiting between six and nine months, and those waiting for between nine and 12 months or more. All the figures are very transparent for anybody who wants to see them. We have been very clear from day one that there would be difficulties in some subspecialties where there are no consultants or where there is no capacity. However, even if one leaves aside any targets or maxima, one notes the number of people waiting for an outpatient appointment, for example, is down by 5,776 since the start of the year. We will continue to invest additional resources so we can continue to lower the figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I am pleased to present the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 to the House. It should be noted that this Bill is very much of a technical nature and is designed primarily to address certain national and international obligations arising from a number of issues associated with the EU financial services legislative and transposition agenda. There is also a technical amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> There are five parts to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Part 1 is preliminary and general. This covers sections 1 and 2 which are provisions of a standard and general nature. Part 2 is the agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the single resolution fund<b>. </b>This covers sections 3 to 5, inclusive, and is necessary to enable the ratification of this intergovernmental agreement which is required to allow the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM, to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Part 3 is the deposit guarantee scheme. This covers sections 6 to 14, inclusive, and involves a number of amendments to the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009. These are necessary for two reasons, first, to put in place a transitional funding arrangement for the new deposit guarantee contributory scheme to underpin it while its accompanying fund is being built up, and second, to reduce the period within which the Exchequer should recoup the Central Bank where it contributes its own resources towards a deposit guarantee scheme compensation event. This is necessary to avoid the bank or the European Central Bank, ECB, engaging in monetary financing of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Part 4 is the continuation of insurance regulations<b>. </b>This covers sections 15 to 20, inclusive, and the Schedule. This is necessary to ensure the continuation of insurance regulation for companies outside the scope of the solvency II directive which is due to come into force at the start of 2016. This will apply only to insurance entities below a certain premium threshold or in wind-down.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Part 5 is a technical amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014<b>. </b>This covers section 21 and is necessary to remove any potential ambiguity with regard to whether a directed investment made by the National Pensions Reserve Fund commission and subsequently transferred to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund pursuant to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 remains a directed investment for the purposes of that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> I wish to inform the House that I will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage that will add an additional Part to this Bill. This will be a minor but important amendment that will alter section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which contains provisions relating to the Revenue Commissioners' treatment of confidential taxpayer information. This section of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides reassurance to taxpayers that personal and commercial information revealed for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure. One of the circumstances in which it is permitted to disclose confidential taxpayer information is where a Revenue officer is satisfied that the work of a tax adviser or agent acting on behalf of a taxpayer does not meet the professional standards of the professional body of which the tax adviser or agent is a member. This amendment will allow Revenue disclose confidential taxpayer information to the Law Society of Ireland in such circumstances where the tax adviser or agent is a solicitor, ensuring equal treatment across the broad range of tax advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I emphasise the importance of an early completion of the passage of this Bill to enable implementation of significant elements of the EU financial services legislative agenda. This will increase the stability of the financial system and increase protections for insurance policyholders, investors and depositors. In particular, I highlight the need to ratify the intergovernmental agreement before 30 November 2015 as failure to do so would almost certainly lead to a delay in the implementation of the Single Resolution Mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> I will go into more detail about the main provisions of the Bill. Part 2 is the agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the single resolution fund, sections<b>
						</b>3 to 5, inclusive. The purpose of Part 2 is to enable the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement through the lodgment of the appropriate documentation with the general secretariat of the Council of the European Union. The intergovernmental agreement was negotiated to enable the single resolution fund, a key element of the Single Resolution Mechanism, to be operationalised with effect from 1 January 2016. Its primary purpose is to transfer the contributions raised at national level in accordance with the bank resolution and recovery directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism regulation to the single resolution fund and to facilitate a transition period of eight years to full mutualisation of the fund. It also prescribes how the single resolution fund will operate during the transition period. The agreement, which at 16 articles is relatively short, was negotiated to deal with a concern of certain member states that these changes could not be accommodated within the SRM regulation as, in their view, Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union did not provide an appropriate legal basis to do so. Consequently, it was agreed that this issue should be dealt with through an intergovernmental agreement which would be formally ratified by each member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The legislation covers just the core points of the function of the Minister and the power to spend. The remaining commitments, like the agreement, are binding on the State at state level and therefore do not require domestic legislation to give effect to them. The Attorney General has advised that as the agreement constitutes an international agreement under Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution, and as it deals with funding, Dáil approval is required. Consequently, I intend moving a motion seeking its approval in parallel with this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I would like to say a few words about the Single Resolution Mechanism to give Members a sense of the importance of this intergovernmental agreement. In this regard, the Single Resolution Mechanism is the second pillar of the banking union and will ensure that if a bank subject to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, faces serious difficulties, its resolution will be managed efficiently with minimal costs to the taxpayers and the real economy through a single resolution board and a single resolution fund, financed by levies imposed on the banking sector. What this means in practice is that should any of our three major banks get into financial trouble, the decision about putting it into resolution will be made by the single resolution board rather than our domestic resolution authority. In addition, where bail-in of shareholders, capital instruments and eligible liabilities is insufficient to cover losses of the bank in question, there will be access to funds from the single resolution fund. This will contribute to breaking the link between the banks and the sovereign and should help avoid a repeat of many of the issues faced by countries during the recent financial crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Part 3 is the deposit guarantee scheme, and this covers sections 6 to 14, inclusive. As mentioned at the outset, the purpose of this Part is twofold, first, to put in place a transitional funding arrangement to underpin the new deposit guarantee scheme while its accompanying fund is being built up, and second, to reduce the period within which the Exchequer should recoup the Central Bank where it contributes its own resources towards a deposit guarantee scheme compensation event. The transitional funding arrangement is covered by sections 6 to 11, inclusive. Their primary purpose is to create a new legacy fund into which an amount equal to 0.2% of covered deposits of credit institutions will be transferred from the existing deposit guarantee fund, known as the deposit protection account, and to establish under what circumstances money can be paid out from this new legacy fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> The background to this proposal is the transposition of the deposit guarantee schemes directive which is proceeding parallel to this legislation. The directive will change the nature of our deposit guarantee funding arrangements from what is currently a ring-fenced deposit held by credit institutions in the Central Bank to a contributory fund. The difference in approach is significant and without this legislation we would be required to return all the deposits in the deposit protection account to credit institutions. The legacy fund is necessary therefore to ensure we continue to have access to an adequate level of alternative funding during the period the new contributory fund is being built up.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> The key sections for the transitional funding arrangement are as follows. Section 8 amends section 3 of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 by providing for the establishment by the Central Bank of a new legacy fund<i>
						</i>consisting of funds transferred from the deposit protection account to the amount of 0.2% of covered deposits.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">It also provides that the balance of the funds in the deposit protection account should be returned to credit institutions, and specifies when the legacy fund shall cease to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Section 9 relates to the amount to be maintained in deposit protection account. This section amends the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009, by replacing the existing section 4. It provides that a credit institution shall not carry out the business of such a body unless it has transferred 0.2% of covered deposits from the deposit protection account to the legacy fund on a date determined by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Section 10 relates to order of payments. It provides for the insertion of two new sections, sections 5A and 5B, into the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009. The purpose of the proposed section 5A is to set out the order of payments in the event of a deposit guarantee scheme compensation event arising to ensure a level playing field between existing credit institutions and new entrants to the market, and to provide that the amount a credit institution holds in the legacy fund is reduced on a yearly basis by its annual contribution to the contributory fund. The purpose of the proposed section 5B is to provide a basis for the return of legacy fund deposits - where there is any remaining - after three years to a credit institution which has ceased to carry on business.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Section 11 deals with charges etc. on the deposit protection account. This section amends the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009, by replacing the existing section 6. It provides that any deposits by credit institutions in the legacy fund are protected from charges being placed upon them other than by the Central Bank. The reduction in the period within which the Central Bank is recouped by the Exchequer in the event that it contributes its resources towards a deposit guarantee scheme compensation event is covered by section 12. This section amends section 8 of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009, by reducing the period for recoupment from three months to two weeks. Such a provision is necessary to prevent the bank or the European Central Bank engaging in monetary financing of the State. The Central Bank has advised that the ECB believes the existing three month recoupment period is too long and that to ensure the prohibition on monetary financing is maintained a far shorter period is required. This explains why we are proposing to reduce this period to two weeks. Colleagues should also be aware that I am in the process of consulting with the ECB on this provision. Therefore, I should have greater insight into the ECB position on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> As a final comment on Part 3, Deputies should note that section 13 provides for the insertion of a new section 8E into the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009. Its purpose is to enable, after the coming into force of this Bill, the return of any money recovered by the deposit protection account to credit institutions which results from a successful claim by the Central Bank against credit institutions or their liquidators which had commenced prior to its enactment. This provision is necessary because at this stage credit institutions will be holding their requisite balance of 0.2% of covered deposits in the newly established legacy fund and will, therefore, not owe it any more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Part 4 relates to the continuation of insurance regulations and covers sections 15 to 20, inclusive. The purpose of this part is to establish a regulatory regime for insurance undertakings that will be outside of the scope of the Solvency II directive. The directive excludes certain undertakings based either on size, for example, small insurance undertakings below a certain insurance premium threshold, or on the basis that they will have wound down their operation in advance of 1 January 2019. It is essential that we maintain the current regulatory regime for such undertakings to ensure there are no unregulated insurance undertakings in the State from 1 January 2016, when the Solvency II regime comes into effect. As the current regulatory regime is governed by EU directives that are to be repealed by Solvency II, continuation of that regime can only be done by primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I will set out the key sections covering these changes. Section 16 covers the continuation of certain regulations. The Solvency II directive repeals a number of EU directives relating to insurance and reinsurance. Section 16 continues in force the regulations transposing those repealed directives in respect of the undertakings excluded from the scope of Solvency II. Section 17 deals with portfolio transfers. To ensure continuity and ease of reference, the provisions in the Solvency II directive governing portfolio transfers will also apply to the relevant undertakings covered by this Bill. I expect to table some technical Committee Stage amendments to this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> The Schedule lists all the revocations to be carried out in terms of the current regulations as all or parts of those regulations are no longer necessary. Part 5 contains technical amendments to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014. These are contained in section 21. This is a technical amendment to the definition of a "directed investment" at section 37 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014. Paragraph 21 of Part 6 of Schedule 4 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that any direction given to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission under section 19A, 19AA or 19B of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 before the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund constitution date shall have effect on or after that date, until revoked, as if given to the National Treasury Management Agency under sections 42, 47(4)(b), 47(4)(c) or 43 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Section 37(a) of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a "directed investment" means an investment made by the National Treasury Management Agency pursuant to a direction under section 42 or 47(4)(b) or the proceeds held by the National Treasury Management Agency pursuant to a direction under section 47(4)(c). A potential ambiguity has been identified in respect of whether investments of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which were "directed investments" at the time they were made and at the time of their transfer into the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, are captured by the definition of "directed investments" in section 37 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014. The amendment clarifies that "directed investments" made by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and subsequently transferred to the Irish Strategic Investment Fund by the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 are "directed investments" for the purposes of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> In conclusion, I reiterate the importance of the swift passage of this Bill to ensure the implementation of a significant portion of the EU financial services legislative agenda. It will result in increased protections for insurance policyholders, depositors and investors. I am particularly keen that we ratify the intergovernmental agreement as soon as possible. This is an issue which Europe and the markets are watching closely, and failure to ratify it would have a negative impact on the wider banking union project. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_172">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate. This is the latest stage in the process of establishing what is described as banking union throughout the eurozone. The basic intention in the three-pronged approach to banking union, comprising the single supervisory mechanism, the single resolution authority and the deposit guarantee scheme, is to ensure that at no time in the future will there be another taxpayer-led round of bailouts of banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> We have already had the bank resolution and recovery directive, BRRD, dealing with the hierarchy of creditors. It established the circumstances in which losses would be imposed on shareholders, unsecured creditors including junior and senior bondholders and, potentially, deposits of over €100,000. A single resolution fund to finance the restructuring of failing credit institutions is now planned to be established as an essential part of the single resolution mechanism. In previous debates I have questioned whether the size of the fund would be adequate to meet all the potential demands which could be put on it. While the general eurozone situation has stabilised since then, I believe this concern remains valid.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I would welcome some clarity from the Minister on when exactly the single resolution fund will be operational. I understood the original intention was that drawdowns could be made from 2018 where necessary, but there have been some calls for this to be expedited. Given that the crisis first began to unfold in 2007, no one could accuse the European authorities of being in a rush to take action to ensure that it never happens again. </p>
          <p eId="para_175"> The Bill also makes amendments to the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 in order to put in place a transitional funding arrangement for the new deposit guarantee scheme. It is questionable to state that we are witnessing the creation of a genuine banking union, underpinned by common deposit insurance, when earlier this year the Greek people had capital controls imposed upon them. Greek citizens were subject to withdrawal limits of less than €100 per day from ATMs. We saw scenes of old people fainting in queues as they waited to get their hands on their pensions. </p>
          <p eId="para_176"> In earlier stages in the eurozone crisis it was not uncommon for people to move money out of local banks in Spain, Italy and Cyprus to safer destinations. This sits very uneasily alongside the notion of full banking union. In essence, a Greek euro was perceived to be less safe than a German euro in recent months. The long-term damage that this will do to the eurozone project remains to be seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I note that earlier this month German finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, sought to pour cold water on the common deposit insurance initiative. A German paper submitted to a meeting of EU Finance Ministers last month stated: "To now start a discussion on further mutualisation of bank risks through a common deposit insurance or European deposit reinsurance scheme is unacceptable." It now appears that the best we can hope for is a reinsurance fund which would contribute under certain conditions when national deposit guarantee schemes are called upon. We are still a long way from a common deposit insurance scheme, and for the time being a German euro will continue to be regarded as being worth more than a Greek euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> While I am on the subject of the deposit guarantee scheme, I would like to mention the credit union sector in Ireland. It has put forward a reasonable suggestion, namely, that it be charged a lower levy for participation in the scheme than the 0.2% rate that applies to other financial institutions. This is fair, given the lower risk it poses. I also repeat my belief that it is wrong to limit the deposits it can take from customers to the €100,000 level of the deposit guarantee scheme. I understand some 55% of credit unions will be affected by this, based on their current customer profiles. It sends the wrong signal and puts the credit union sector at a competitive disadvantage relative to banks. I do not see the justification for this change, and urge the Minister to reconsider this decision and rescind the proposed cap on credit union savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the continuation of insurance regulation for companies outside the scope of the Solvency II directive. I have said in the past in this House that the system of regulation of insurance in Ireland and across European jurisdictions is inadequate. This was most recently demonstrated in the case of Setanta Insurance, but was also evident in the collapse of Quinn Insurance and the difficulties at RSA. What was particularly noteworthy in the case of Setanta Insurance was the apparent regulation shopping that went on, whereby the firm sought out the most favourable location in which to establish itself. Given that an insurance company which is prudentially regulated in one country can passport its services into another member state in the eurozone, it is essential that each member state take its national responsibilities in respect of regulation of the insurance sector seriously. The overall system of regulation is only as strong as its weakest link, as we saw in the Setanta Insurance case, an issue that is still being played out.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> There is no strong case for the development of a single supervisory system for the insurance sector across Europe which would mirror that being developed for the banking sector. I am talking about going beyond the new directive in place for insurance. There is far greater cross-border sale of insurance products than other financial services, and citizens in one state should not be put at risk due to the failures of regulation in another member country. There is a need to better inform consumers in this jurisdiction about the fact that many insurance companies are not fully regulated here; rather, they are regulated for prudential purposes in other countries and passport in services. They are only regulated here for conduct of business purposes. Ordinary people do not make that distinction, and there is a far greater need for the Central Bank to inform people of the distinction between the systems of regulation that apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> The Bill also makes a technical change to the definition of an investment in the directed portfolio within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, formerly known as the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This gives me an opportunity to refer to the major decisions that lie ahead in respect of the directed portfolio. The open market value of AIB is now put at up to €13 billion. In the next 12 months there is a reasonable prospect of the bank redeeming the contingent convertible capital notes and a significant proportion of the preference shares. These events will lead to a significant inflow of cash to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, yet there is precious little discussion as to what will be done with the proceeds. Earlier this year some cash was taken out of the fund to assist with the early repayment of IMF loans, which made good financial sense for the State, given the relatively high interest rate which attached to those loans. It was something I had advocated for some time. </p>
          <p eId="para_182"> It is not immediately obvious what the Minister would do with any upcoming windfalls from the sale of bank assets. There remains the option of using them to pay down debt. This is certainly worth considering, given the high debt-to-GDP ratio that the State still has, even though it has fallen. On the other hand, we are able to borrow at record low rates of interest, and the benefit in terms of interest savings from paying down debts is now a lot less than it was before. A further option is to deploy some of the cash from the directed portfolio to the discretionary portfolio, which is currently investing some €7 billion in economically productive investments. The fund has gotten off to a reasonable start, but it will take some time before we know the true impact of the investment it has made. It is reasonable to ask the Minister to bring forward a paper setting out in detail the options for deployment of the cash that will be realised over time from the sale of the directed portfolio, and I hope he will give consideration to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> A discussion on legislation dealing with banking union would not be complete without reference to the June 2012 euro area summit statement, which pledged to "examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well performing adjustment programme." This was famously described by the Government as a game changer. The truth is that while the EU agreement appeared significant on the surface, it was dramatically oversold in Ireland. No sooner was the ink dry on the summit communiqué than some of the more powerful eurozone countries were putting an entirely different spin on what was actually agreed. The reference to specifically examining the Irish financial sector has not resulted in one cent of the €30 billion injected by Ireland to save AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB being refunded in any way by the EU. Government leaders here were in such a rush to go further than each other in welcoming the agreement that they did not secure anything in it that would deliver with certainty a tangible and measurable deal to make our debt more sustainable and help Irish citizens. Over three years on, a deal on retroactive bank recapitalisation for Ireland seems as far away as ever. </p>
          <p eId="para_184"> The formal application process for ESM funding opened last November. At this stage, there is hardly a serious commentator left who believes that the Government will actually get the deal it was in such a rush to claim it had achieved. It appears an open-market sale of the banks remains the only game in town. This may result in the recouping of significant sums, but it is most certainly not what was promised three years ago. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Overall, we welcome the Bill. It is broadly technical in nature and the Minister has signalled a number of amendments he intends to bring forward on Committee Stage. We will work co-operatively with him in dealing with them. We hope for the early passage of the Bill, which is warranted and is of merit to the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_186">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an mBille seo. Is é an rud atá os ár gcomhair i ndáiríre ná ceithre Bhille ach iad go léir i mBille amháin. Chomh maith leis sin, fógraíodh ar maidin go bhfuil Bille eile le cur ina measc. Ciallaíonn sé seo go mbeidh thart ar chúig Bhille i mBille amháin. An é seo an dóigh is fearr le reachtaíocht a thabhairt os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais? An é seo an dóigh is fearr dúinn chun plé agus mionscrúdú a dhéanamh ar na hábhair seo uilig, go háirithe agus an tAire ag rá go mbeidh leasú eile ann ar Chéim an Choiste? Cuireann sé seo imní orm mar ní rabhamar in ann réamh-scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an leasú sin agus níl sé le feiceáil againn fós agus muid ar an Dara Céim den reachtaíocht.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> What we have before us is really four Bills in one, and I will address each element of the Bill in turn, but if these issues are so necessary we need to question why they could not have been taken in turn by the House to allow for greater scrutiny in their own right. I note the fact some of these measures were supposed to be taken in individual pieces of legislation. While, as Deputy McGrath said, the measures are technical and there do not seem to be any major issues with what is in the legislation, the fact the Minister has signalled another change on Committee Stage does not lead to proper practice and scrutiny of issues. In this case, the issues are tax and tax disclosure to relevant authorities. This means we have missed two key stages, namely, pre-legislative scrutiny and Second Stage because we do not know what the Committee Stage amendment will contain, bar the 100 words the Minister has mentioned on Second Stage. I appreciate that sometimes issues come to the Minister's attention which need to be dealt with in a speedy manner and if it were not incorporated in a miscellaneous provisions Bill, which is the purpose of such legislation, it could be long fingered for months or years given the demands on time for legislation. I just want to make the point it is not best practice and it should be avoided at all costs. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on why this has suddenly come about when he responds to the Second Stage debate or on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Well over half a decade has passed since the banking crisis that struck globally had such a catastrophic impact on this country. A recent ECB study showed how the resulting years have lead to a drop in wealth, which was greater in Ireland than any other eurozone country, including Greece. We were told that Europe needed to act and that new banking laws and regimes would swiftly follow, but what we have seen develop was not swift. Here we are today, in October 2015, still debating that new regime. What we have seen over recent years is a very definitive watering down of the concept of a banking union designed to break the link between sovereign and banking debt. When the final vote in the European Parliament was taken, my party did not support what had become a very diluted proposal. The new banking union does not break enough from the past. The logic that some banks are too big to fail is still inherent in the system. The taxpayer has not ended up sheltered from another catastrophe. After years of negotiations, EU leaders have come up very short of expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> The issue at hand today is accepting that we should wait eight further years for an EU-wide resolution system. Until then, so called national compartments within the fund will be the first port of call, then the bail out happens and then the State itself is tapped. Does this sound like the break between the sovereign and the banks which was promised? Even after eight years, the State is still in line before the ESM is called upon. We all recall that much was made of the existence of the ESM by the Government. It was, we were told, the reason we had to accept the austerity treaty rules. It was also to be the life saver and great avenger, which the then Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, told us could be used to get our money back in the spirit of these new times. We do not hear much about either of these uses of the ESM nowadays and, as this legislation shows, even in its primary purpose as a recapitalisation tool it is not designed to be ever called upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> It is now ten months since the option of applying for that retrospective recapitalisation became available. Since then there has been nothing from the Minister. The excellent recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General shows up the spin the Government and banks have been engaged in over recent years to try to minimise the actual losses and suffering the Irish people went through because of the banking crisis. It puts the net cost of the banking crisis as of the end of the year at €43 billion. It also talks about the interest accrued by the State which is paid annually as a result of the banking crisis. The Minister would have us believe we are moving towards somehow breaking even. It is in the power of the Government to apply for the retrospective recapitalisation of the pillar banks. As Deputy McGrath said, this option has been open to it since November last year. It is incredible and inexplicable that it has not yet applied. It stands out as one of the greatest failures of the many failures of the Government, which has claimed a game changer and a seismic shift but has failed miserably and totally on Ireland's banking debt. The toxic Anglo Irish Bank debt has been pushed out onto children's shoulders and the pillar banking debt will be paid by the people, but here we are being asked to say okay to a new system that will allow it all to happen again, perhaps with less impact, but the call on the State is still built into the system. The idea of a banking union which separates banking and sovereign debt has been thrown away along with the legitimate demand of the Irish people for justice on our debt. That debt still hangs like a huge shadow over our economic future and will do so even using the most optimistic forecasts. The mandate the Government received almost five years ago was to stand up for Ireland and this mandate has been squandered.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The second part of the Bill is to put in place a transitional regime for the deposit guarantee scheme. Currently, the deposit protection account holds €370 million, which is available for any calls under the deposit guarantee scheme. The plan is to hand €200 million of this money back to the banks and other financial institutions. The remaining €170 million will form the basis of a new legacy fund. This sum will cover the contributions of the financial institutions for the first two years. Rather than some sort of new insurance policy for many banks, this change will be, in the short term, a financial return. I note the issue of the ECB monetary financing prohibition is raised. The ECB has consistently raised concerns about the promissory note trick and its compliance with the monetary financing rules. It is more than likely that extra pressure will be placed on the Central Bank to dispose of the Anglo Irish Bank bonds sooner rather than later as a result. I question why only €170 million of the €370 million is being placed in the legacy fund and I will deal with this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> It is important the Minister listens to the legitimate calls about the credit union sector, not only regarding the levies to be placed on them and the rate but also the cap on deposits. I am on the record as repeatedly stating the Central Bank fails to understand the importance and origins of the credit union sector and needs to understand in a better way the democratic and not-for-profit role of the organisation. On this note, I welcome the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane. I wish him every success and I hope he comes down hard on the individual banks and the institutions which need to have a firm stick taken to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The Bill allows for the continuance of regulation on small insurance companies and those that are winding down. When I saw the Bill originally in its own right in the legislative programme last year I was hopeful it was an antidote to the situation regarding Setanta Insurance. I was disappointed to hear this is not the case. Why do we not have legislation to deal with the situation in which tens of thousands of Setanta Insurance customers now find themselves? Last week, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform received an update from the Department of Finance telling us the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, was appealing the High Court ruling that it was liable for third party claims at Setanta Insurance. This was only the latest twist in this story. Initially, the Minister for Finance told me the MIBI would be liable. After concerns were raised by the MIBI, the Minister and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport sought legal advice from the Attorney General. We are told the Attorney General gave unambiguous advice that the insurance compensation fund, and not the MIBI, was liable. The practical effect of this advice would be to limit the payments some claimants would receive and that the State would pay out from the insurance compensation fund directly. The Law Society stepped in and rightly challenged this decision to the High Court, which has backed its case and found the MIBI, contrary to the Attorney General's advice and the view of the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is indeed responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Now, as an appeal is pending and a stay is awarded, the claimants are back in the limbo they have been in for many months now. Some of these individuals are very sick and some may have shortened life expectancy, waiting for their claims to be paid. Not a penny has been paid because of this legal wrangle. What advice or reassurance can the Minister give to those customers and what is there in the Solvency Il directive to prevent another case similar to that of Setanta Insurance tomorrow?</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The final element of this Bill is the amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act. It is clear that this amendment has only one purpose, which is to make it easier to sell AlB. This year the State received €280 million in dividends from its shares in AIB and €160 million in interest on its contingent convertible, CoCo, shares. We will receive another €160 million from these CoCo shares next year, plus the redemption capital of €1.6 billion. The Minister has stated he will not sell the ordinary shares in AIB before the election, and I welcome that. A strategic, coherent vision of how to use our banking assets is missing, however, and it seems the only vague vision is to sell back to the private investors that cost the public billions of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I recently received a response to a freedom of information request to the Department of Finance focusing on the Minister's meetings with the banks last month on the issue of the standard variable rates that they charge. For each of the other banks, the agenda was straightforward. The two items were standard variable rates and mortgage arrears. However, the agenda for the meeting with AIB was far more detailed and examined many issues, including lending to agriculture. There were ten- or 12-line items, compared with two-line items for all the other institutions. This is not reflective of the type of relationship the Minister likes to portray of a strictly hands-off role as owner of the bank. There is clearly a different approach from the Department of Finance with AIB when compared with Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and other institutions that we have either recapitalised or regulated. I welcome that, but it is important to note there is a different relationship. The Minister is clearly acting more in the role of a director or manager, which is good. AlB is a valuable State asset and it is right that democratic influence can be brought to bear on it. I hope it marks the beginning of a more realistic way of using the influence bought, at much cost to the Irish people, at that bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I was disappointed that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Bank of Ireland were unavailable to meet the Minister last month. I know he met a delegation from the bank but I hope he followed up with Mr. Boucher personally when he returned to these shores. It is clear that his bank has been the most reluctant to move in the standard variable rates issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> With regard to AIB, it is potentially the biggest sale of a State asset encountered in this country. Many people rightly see AIB as a debt or burden and the Irish people took that on at much cost to themselves, our society and our economy. The bank has a value today and, as Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned, it is in the region of €13 billion. This is about more than the nominal value, as it has worth as the engine which can drive forward economic activity. As the Minister discussed with representatives of AIB some weeks ago, this can be through lending to the agricultural sector, small businesses in different sectors, and the elderly. We will not have such influence with the KBCs of this world or any other foreign bank where we do not have a shareholding.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> There is a serious need for a real, calm and logical discussion of what can be done with one of the biggest assets that this State holds. Do we sell it to private investors so we can write down our debt? That is likely to happen with any income we receive from a portion of the sale of AIB. It was pointed out to the banking inquiry by a director of AIB, who served in a senior position at the National Treasury Management Agency, that this would be foolish because we can borrow so cheaply in the international markets; the amount of revenue we receive from AIB on an annual basis would exceed the cost of servicing that debt into the future. All of those issues must be considered, and we must see what is in the best interests of the State and its finances and what policy can be pursued to deal with all issues of lending to the productive sector and ensuring that finance is available for house building, particularly social housing, and other matters related to the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> I welcome the Minister's indication that he will not sell the AIB shares prior to the election, but we need more than that. There must be a committee structure - similar to the finance committee - that will take in experts, listen to opinions and consider all the options for the assets we now hold within our banks. That is to see what is the best use for them. Having experts within the banking sector writing a report for the Minister on a <i>pro bono</i> basis is not good enough, and this process must be democratised. It must be inclusive and shared with all parties in this House, as well as Independents, who have very strong views on the matter. We must be able to examine the evidence, consider the different opinions and create a path for what to do in the next number of years with regard to assets, particularly in AIB and Bank of Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_202">I wish to speak about one aspect of the Bill that will enable ratification of the intergovernmental agreement to the Single Supervisory Mechanism in order to make it operable. As we know, this is part of a suite of measures introduced at European level to bring about banking union. As the fairy tale unwinds - we had to listen to it earlier - we are expected to believe that the great shining knights of the political establishment across Europe will come in and valiantly battle with the big, bad wolf of the banking sector and defend little Red Riding Hood; essentially, if the banks get into trouble again, the public will not be bankrupted because of it. My only answer to that is, "Yeah, right." That we are discussing this is an irony in that this week figures emerged revealing that within Europe, the Irish public suffered a per-head reduction in wealth far in excess of any of our European counterparts. The reduction was €18,000 per head. The ordinary people of Spain and Greece were similarly decimated, but at the same time wealth in the Netherlands and Germany rocketed. Given that we know that Ireland's wealthiest citizens have seen their wealth rise substantially, the overall loss is doubly hard to take, as the ordinary citizens would have paid a price even beyond the reported figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> If this was truly a solution to the bank bailout issue, it would be great, but it is not. It is appropriate to examine bailouts that took place across the eurozone since 2008, which cost €1.7 trillion. The cost to the Irish public was €64 billion, and we spent €2.3 billion this year alone servicing the debts to the banks, which were paid for by the unrelenting cuts in public services, social welfare, housing, jobs and decent pay and conditions for workers. It is a very painful and vivid memory that the poorest and weakest of our citizens have had to endure. Across Europe there is a structural reorganisation of society or, in some instances, a political counter-revolution. Many of the gains in social welfare and post-war reforms that were delivered have been rowed back on in the name of finance capital. Many people do not want to remember the bank bailout - it is a painful memory for Fianna Fáil - but the Government told us before the last election that not one red cent would be paid. It would be Labour's way or Frankfurt's way and so on. As it has developed, history has turned out radically different.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">While on the face of it a system to bring about an orderly resolution of the banks seems like a great idea, we have to be very clear that the proposal on the table is not that and has little promise of delivering an end to the bailouts by the public. The Single Resolution Fund is only €55 billion, which is chicken feed in the world of banking. According to back-of-an-envelope calculations by one of the <i>Financial Times</i> economists, the banks could be holding bad assets to the tune of about €2.6 trillion. In that context, €55 billion is a pittance.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> It is inevitable that the public will be called upon again to bail out the banks. The fund will only come in eight years from now. If a bank gets into trouble before then or if there is a need for a bailout beyond the €55 billion provided, the only backstop is the ESM and we all know what that means because we only have to look at what happened when the Spanish Government went to the ESM to recapitalise the banks in 2012. What was the price the Spanish people had to pay? They had to sign up to massive policy conditionality, including demands to increase the cost-effectiveness of their health care sector, pension reforms, labour market reforms, reforms of public transport, massive privatisation and so on, a similar demand to that made of the population of Greece. Yes, we will give you some of this money, but in return we want you to decimate your public services, we want you to unleash privatisation and we want you to sacrifice everything to the altar of neoliberalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> What we are looking at is a banking union with a resolution mechanism that is not near enough. That is obvious even at the start. It is likely that as the negotiations go further in terms of banking union, the banking lobby will dictate the pace because we have seen it do that throughout the process. In the meantime, there will be no end to the creation of speculative financial instruments which have caused so much damage in the first place. According to analysis from Finance Watch, with which I agree, a bank resolution system that, as in this case, does not contain ambitious preventative measures such as dealing with the "too big to fail" problem, the "too interconnected to fail" problem and the "too complex to resolve" problem is just not credible. This has not been addressed in any way by the provisions before us. We will have a European banking sector that remains as interconnected as ever and as dominated by the megabanks, which are not going to be of any benefit to the citizens of Europe and certainly not to the citizens of Ireland. As Finance Watch says, "if banks are not reformed such that they pose less of a systemic risk they will simply block the mechanisms designed to resolve them". That is what we have had from this process. The banks have blocked the mechanisms designed to resolve the problems and they will continue to do so as long as this Government and its counterparts in Europe continue to enslave themselves to the ideas of neoliberalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The Minister touted the slogan during his budget speech that he would deliver an end to boom and bust politics and all this, but he is not going to do that because it is an inherent part of neoliberalism. It cannot be done, and the imposition of an unrelenting sacrifice on the citizens of Europe will not be tolerated. It is guaranteed that boom and bust and the struggle to resolve that situation will be part of our history because the citizens of Europe certainly cannot afford to shoulder the burden of the banks any longer.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_208">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015. This is a very important debate as it is crucial to have our public finances in order, to have a sustainable economy, a fair tax base that treats our citizens equally and distributes these finances fairly, and common-sense priorities, particularly since the economic crash and the scandal of the banking crisis. We all have to learn lessons from the past and build a new Ireland with sustainable finances, but always built on the foundations of social justice. If we all do that, we can look forward to a bright and fair future. Hence my emphasis on "fair". We want a fair future and fairness in dealing with the public finances and the broader issues like taxation and public expenditure. Before I go into the details of the Bill, and especially the four key aspects of the legislation, it is important not to run away from the core issue of our public finances and the tax issue. We are a great little country for hammering the regular man and woman or the poor people in society. It is time now to open our eyes and see the bigger picture in respect of our finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The finance Bill has a fourfold purpose. It will enable the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement to the Single Resolution Mechanism, it provides for a transitional funding arrangement for the new deposit guarantee contributory scheme, it ensures the continuation of existing regulations for the insurance undertakings not covered within the scope of the Solvency II directive on insurance and reinsurance, and it proposes technical amendments to strengthen the legislation surrounding directed investments in the National Treasury Management Agency. Those are the four key aspects to this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> In dealing with our finances and tax, we must have a broader view and not only an insular one. A global problem in respect of tax needs a global response. We saw the recent base erosion and profit shifting proposals. Will they lead to more of the $240 billion in OECD estimates being lost? We are talking about €2 billion or €3 billion in Irish society, but in the context of this broader debate, when figures like $240 billion could be collected Europe-wide and internationally for different countries around the world, we need to examine, be brave and speak out on these issues. We also need to be brave, assertive and aggressive to challenge aggressive multinational tax planning in this society. We seem to be running back and hiding under the stones in dealing with this issue. It is very important, especially for countries that do not have the massive resources many countries have. It is equally important for countries that are not very well off.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> On the tax issue, not a word was mentioned anywhere in the Dáil or in broader society about the €44 million extra that was taken in by Revenue following a trawl of wealthy individuals in Ireland over the summer weeks, ahead of the June deadline. This involved only 137 cases but the average settlement was in the region of €320,000. That was fair enough. Some might say €44 million is no big deal. However, looking at the work that Revenue has done over a number of years since it started doing this, it has managed to rake in €2.7 billion on 35,000 cases. That is a massive amount of resources. Those who say there is no money in broader society and that we are all taxed to death need to understand these figures exist. They are not my figures, they are Revenue's figures. In recent years, €2.7 billion was brought in by Revenue and fair play to it on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> The three main aims of the Single Supervisory Mechanism are to ensure the safety and soundness of the European banking system, which we all want, to increase financial integration and stability, and to ensure consistent supervision. Some people have concerns about the second proposal. We cannot go back to the days where banks were allowed to carry on in the way they did. The problem is a broader political one. Some senior bankers and major speculators destroyed the country and our economic and financial system. Others participated in this as well and it is very important to highlight that.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Those involved in politics often get the blame for the actions of others. I would like a little more personal responsibility to be taken when we deal with the broader issue of what happened during the crisis and the so-called Celtic tiger era. There are many who say that we all partied. I reject that assertion. Many of us did not party during the period in question, so that view must be challenged. There were some who partied but they never accepted personal responsibility. That is an aspect of the matter to which consideration must be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> As some of my colleagues have said, the value of AIB is in the region of €13 billion. That is a major asset. I would issue a word of warning here. When we come to consider the proposals that will be put forward - as the Minister indicated, this will happen after the election - any recommendation to sell off AIB or to identify other options in respect of it or the other banks should be examined thoroughly, professionally and independently. When one has a €13 billion asset which can act as a major engine for the economy, one must obtain the best advice. Sadly, in the past we did not obtain such advice. It is important to highlight this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> There are other issues relating to the banks about which I have, at times, criticised the Government. The interest payments on the bailout money alone continue to cost as much each year as all of the tax cuts and the spending increases. We need to examine that. We talk about a democratic revolution but we need to get on with it and we must also ensure that there is more accountability and transparency when dealing with the public finances. That is why we always must be vigilant when talking about the Economic Management Council and its role in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I reject some of the comments made last week by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when he criticised Greece and inquired as to where are the supporters of Syriza now. The Minister forgot two things: first, the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras, won the election; and, second, Germany and Poland were among those countries which attacked Greece at the onset of the crisis. It must be remembered that Germany defaulted unilaterally in the 1930s and received massive debt relief in 1953, and that Poland, another EU member state, had large debts written off in 1989. I accept that Greece was in a bad way but it is the duty of all of us in the European Union to assist other countries. I am of the view that we need a collective response, not an isolationist policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Returning to the legislation, the purpose of the provision in section 4 is to allow the Minister to carry out all such things as are necessary and expedient for the purpose of the State performing its functions under the agreement, particularly those specified in subsection (2). Section 5, which relates to the defrayal of certain expenses, indicates that any expenses incurred by the Minister under section 4 shall be paid out of the Central Fund. I raise these issues because the issue of expenses being paid out of the Central Fund is important in the context of the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> When discussing the spending of State funds, we need to be vigilant. I am particularly concerned about this matter in the context of the broader debate on housing. Many have raised the issue of rents, the housing crisis and the homelessness crisis. Most economists, if one looks at it objectively, say that rent control does not work. I strongly support the view that we need to be vigilant and increase rent supplement to match market prices. I am also strongly supportive of building more social housing, improving the position with regard to security of tenure and putting in place stronger regulation in respect of landlords in order to support families. We should not be afraid to consider proposals in this regard. We should certainly not shirk away from such proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> I accept that there are instances of some landlords getting a rough time from tenants. Having tenants who do not pay their bills is never an option. Every tenant who I know, particularly the poorest of the poor, will make his or her best efforts to pay the rent. However, there are some others who will not do so. Recently, I dealt with a number of cases in my constituency where landlords have been supportive of certain tenants but who have not been paid rent for six, seven or eight months. These landlords are not getting any justice either. An issue exists in this regard and we need to examine it. If certain tenants are not paying their rent and if there are others who find themselves in dire straits, I would seek to house the latter. It is as simple as that. We need to wake up and face reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> We also need to look at the issue of the empty plots and sites around Dublin city. While the Minister is present, I wish to inform him that I would introduce a use-it-or-lose-it tax to force speculators to sell to developers. I would also bring forward a tax on land-holding because such a measure would help to reduce the costs relating to this issue. I raise these matters in the context of the legislation and of the broader debate as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> In the wake of the economic and financial crisis that started in the eurozone in 2008, the European Commission recognised the need for stronger and better regulation and supervision of the financial sector. One can say that again because it was out of control. Since 2010, the Commission has proposed 28 new rules to better regulate, supervise and govern the financial sector. This is important. The key terms there are, "regulate", "supervise" and "govern the financial sector". These rules aim to provide the basic framework for the EU and to underpin a properly functioning Single Market for financial services. That is important in the context of the broader debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> When we are talking about the public finances, spending and taxes, we also need to know that it is not only about an economy. We have a society. For me, society is people. Without people, there is no society. We need to redevelop trust and community spirit by insisting on people-centred policies and actions. I have dealt with the practical issues but that is the broader vision. I would like to see a new Ireland that is built on equality and social justice. Above all, however, such an Ireland must be built on a sustainable economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I will be as brief as possible. There are only a couple of points I want to raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, with regard to how we can broaden out the home improvement scheme. I understand that people can claim back the VAT paid against their income tax. Perhaps he might given consideration to a particular cohort, namely, those senior citizens who may have money coming in from other sources. The amount of money involved would not be classified as income or would not be sizeable enough to attract income tax. Would it be possible to allow those to whom I refer to write that money off against some of the DIRT they are obliged to pay? Will the Minister give consideration to this proposal?</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> With regard to the capital gains tax for innovators and new companies starting up, I wonder if the Minister would look at the position in the United Kingdom, our main competitor, whose capital gains tax rate on that is 10%. Perhaps he could indicate whether he will make provision for a step process in the coming years in order to allow the capital gains tax rate to be reduced to 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I wish to make two other points. I welcome what the Minister has done in the context of those who had shares in Standard Life. He allowed this matter to be dealt with using a mechanism similar to what which applied in the case of Eircom and I very much welcome that. I have spoken to him on a number of occasions about this and I am delighted that a suitable provision has been included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Finally, I have a point on farmers who have forestry on their land. Such farmers harvest their trees in one go and they are liable for a considerable income tax bill at that stage. Would the Minister consider allowing them to harvest it in one year and spread the tax payment out over a number of years in order that they would not be liable for the entire amount in one go?</p>

          <p eId="para_230">Tomorrow, commuters face another rail strike on one of the busiest days for public transport users. Since August, the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, and the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, have warned that unless genuine efforts were made to resolve the outstanding issues, a strike was inevitable. This was almost three months ago, and there has been virtually no input from the Government to try to find a resolution. The Government has taken a hands-off approach, which seems to be the culture when dealing with relatively substantial matters. The Government allows a crisis to deepen and develop, and what will follow is chaos for travellers. To take this approach is unfair on people who depend so much on public transport as a means of getting to work or attending school or college. Intercity, commuter and DART services will face significant disruption across the country, and although the strike is expected to be confined to a number of hours in the morning, it will have a knock-on effect for the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, suggests it is a very serious situation, while observing from the side lines, like a casual observer who has no involvement in the case. The gap between management and workers appears to be widening over the past three months. Workers believe they have contributed substantially to increasing productivity, and they have. They have made many changes that have improved the company’s viability. However, management consistently says they must find more savings. We are all aware of the core reason for the need to increase productivity and make savings, which is the continued depletion of investment in public transport over a number of years. I do not expect a lecture from the Tánaiste on what happened under the previous Administration.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">The Tánaiste needs to decide and tell us what kind of public transport system her Government wishes to have in place and leave for the future. From listening to the unions last night, one would not be filled with hope about finding a resolution to the strike. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has been busy commending the gigantic effort everybody connected with the talks has put in and he seems to be concerned about the upheaval if the strike goes ahead. However, his only involvement in the strike to date has been to lecture all those concerned that Irish Rail is losing €1 million per month. Like a hurler on the ditch, he is appealing for the strike to be called off. His mantra is that Irish Rail must live within its funding, and it seems to be the Tánaiste's mantra too. He said, "Resolution of the dispute has to be found within the financial framework".</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> I will ask the Tánaiste some straight questions and ask her to limit her response to answering them. Does she accept that there are increased demands on the public transport system and that the changes already introduced by workers have assisted greatly in making savings and increasing productivity? Does she think it is right that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has not intervened to ensure a successful outcome to the process that is under way and prevent a strike?</p>

          <p eId="para_240">The most successful way of settling any dispute is through mediation and discussion, and this is precisely what has been ongoing for a long time. Talks aimed at averting a planned three-hour strike by train drivers tomorrow will resume later. These talks have been undertaken under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. It is very important we settle the dispute. In all the material put forward by both sides, there are grounds for reaching an agreement. The dispute centres on claims by train drivers for payment for past productivity measures such as taking on new safety responsibilities and operating new services. Iarnród Éireann has said it is willing to share the benefits arising from future productivity measures the drivers undertake. This is the kernel of how, with the assistance of very experienced industrial relations negotiators, we can reach the desired outcome I assume everybody in the House, including the Deputy, would wish for, that we would not have a rail strike on a bank holiday weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The biggest losers would be rail services, commuters and people travelling for the bank holiday weekend who would have to find alternative forms of transport. Given that this is a major revenue earning weekend for Iarnród Éireann, I appeal to both parties in the dispute to continue talking so as to arrive at an agreed settlement where there is the possibility, in terms of what is on the table, to reach an agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">It would be particularly helpful to those travelling over the weekend and to regular commuters on their morning commute in and out of work, especially in urban areas, if the dispute could be settled by negotiation. During the recent budget announcements, Deputies will have noted that the Department of Social Protection's contribution to public transport has increased from €77 million to €80 million. This increase will underpin the services provided by the Department, especially to people over the age of 66 through the free travel scheme. We have been issuing new free travel cards, together with identifiable photographs, to pensioners. As a daughter of a railway family - my father and grandfather worked on the railways - I assure the House that like the Department of Social Protection as a whole, I am committed to seeing every effort made to settle this dispute in the interests of the travelling public and of train drivers, who have an important job because they take on the safety of hundreds of passengers over each journey. I am committed to seeing this dispute resolved in a way that secures the future of Irish Rail and allows the company, which is very important right throughout the country, to go forward and make progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">It is clear from the Tánaiste's response that she understands the gravity of the situation and the importance of Irish Rail's activities. I think she appreciates the important work the workers are doing. It is fine that she has made those observations, but in her position as Tánaiste she is in a position to make a substantial contribution to resolving this issue. I suggest the Government needs to interface with management and set out in a clear way how it intends to increase the level of subvention that is required by our public transport system in a growing economy. Like the Minister for Finance, who was displaced from his seat beside the Tánaiste a few moments ago by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, the Tánaiste regularly tells us about the positive impact of the 6% growth in the economy. I remind them that the growth in the economy is accompanied by an increased demand for infrastructure to be provided by the State. When the economy is growing, the demands on the public transport system are growing. That requires further investment. I would have thought it would be important for workers and management alike to see some degree of certainty about how the Government intends to address that funding requirement into the future. I do not want to be political when I say it is important for the Government to set out a clear strategy. It is not enough for it merely to observe; it needs to make an input. Unions and workers are fair-minded people. They need certainty. They need to know that the Government supports the entire public transport infrastructure. They would be forgiven for questioning that because, as the Tánaiste-----</p>

          <p eId="para_245">-----will recall, when this Government came into office, it appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for public transport only for that office subsequently to disappear under the cover of a Cabinet reshuffle. The Minister of State in question did not disappear but was elevated to his current position as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and he has had his own trials and tribulations in that role. In the minds of public transport workers, the Government's stated commitment to public transport vanished during the lifetime of the Government. The Government has quite a bit to do if it is to reassure them.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> I do not think the Tánaiste answered the first question I asked. Does she accept that the productivity of the workers has contributed significantly to the viability of the company? Does she think it is acceptable that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is responsible for this matter, still remains outside this discussion? I do not think he has contributed in a way that would assure the workers that if they avoid the proposed strike, the Government will uphold its commitment to a long-term plan of investment in the public transport system of this State.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">An increase of €28 million in the public service obligation subvention to the public transport companies was provided for in budget 2016. As this is the first time this has been done on such an enormous scale, I suggest that any ordinary person who is aware of the increase, including anyone who works in the CIE group of companies, will see it as a significant vote of confidence in public transport in Ireland and a commitment to the future of rail services. More important, as the Deputy is probably aware, work is under way at the moment to reopen the two-track tunnel under the Phoenix Park that has not been used for decades. This demonstrates that the Government is fully committed to public transport. The tunnel in question will be open this time next year. It will give people coming from Cork and particularly from south Kildare on commuter lines direct access into Connolly Station. That is an absolute vote of confidence in the future of rail in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">It is shocking that 7,630 people were on trolleys across the hospital network in September, which was just last month. That figure represented an increase of 17% on the number of people on trolleys in the same month in 2014. As patients and front-line staff face into the winter period, it looks as if this crisis is certainly going to deepen. Front-line practitioners have said that patient safety is being compromised. Hospital staff are working under unacceptable pressure in a health system that is severely under-resourced. The real cause of this is an ever-increasing lack of confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">While the budget debate was taking place here on Tuesday, 13 October, nurses at St. Vincent's University Hospital in this city were protesting over the appalling conditions they have to work in and that patients are forced to endure. A severe shortage of nurses is a major contributory factor to the current crisis. Nurses are choosing to go abroad because of poor working conditions and a lack of career prospects at home. A survey of 2,000 students across the six medical schools conducted by NUI Galway found that almost nine out of ten trainee nurses and those who have come through the process plan to leave when they qualify. That is a very worrying fact and we must face up to it. Career opportunities, working conditions and lifestyle were the top three reasons given by those surveyed. </p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The INMO estimates, and its figure is confirmed by a comparison between the number of nurses in 2007 and at the end of 2014, that more than 4,000 additional nurses are required in order to return the workforce to a realistic level, one that is capable of meeting the needs of our people. Does the Tánaiste accept that the existing recruitment package is not sufficiently incentivised and will not attract the necessary number of nurses needed to service our health system? What will she do, as Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party in government, to address this very serious matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_289">Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke about the understandable concern about delays and overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. As has been made clear on a number of occasions, dealing with delays in emergency departments is a priority for the Government. The Minister for Health commissioned the emergency department task force last December to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges associated with emergency department overcrowding. The task force last met on Monday, 12 October, and significant progress has been made with all of the relevant parties, including representatives of the nurses organisations, involved in the preparation and delivery of a plan. Delayed discharges are reducing steadily as we speak. The waiting times for funding of packages has been reduced from 11 weeks at the beginning of this year to between two and four weeks now. Transitional care funding has supported approximately 2,000 people who have been approved for the fair deal scheme to move from acute to non-acute care while awaiting a long-term care placement. Over 1,200 additional home care packages will have been provided by the end of this year. Deputy Ó Caoláin and most other Deputies will know from speaking to the relatives of patients that the improvements in the delivery of home care packages have been very widely welcomed and appreciated. In addition, 140 additional public nursing home beds, 24 additional contracted beds in, for instance, Moorehall in County Louth, and 65 short-stay beds in Mount Carmel have all opened in 2015. These provide a mixture of rehabilitation and transitional care for patients who require assisted convalescence before they return home or enter long-term care.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> The director general of the HSE is now co-chairing the emergency department task force implementation group from now until March 2016. He has taken that decision in order to ensure that all of the relevant parts of the health services, including acute, social and primary care, are provided with the optimum resources in order to deal with the particular challenges associated with the winter months. Additional funding of €74 million was provided in April of this year. Deputy Ó Caoláin will have seen a very significant additional supplementary allocation for the HSE and the Department of Health in the context of the budget. He will also have seen a significant additional allocation for next year. In addition to the aforementioned measures, an extra €25 million has been invested in support services which provide alternatives to, or relieve pressure on, our hospitals. </p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The second part of the Deputy's question related to recruitment of nurses by the HSE. I certainly hope that those who are currently completing their nursing degrees and training will give full consideration to a career in nursing in Ireland. I am aware of people who are taking that option but it is not for everybody. It has been traditional for many nurses and other health professionals to go abroad, either for a protracted or limited period of time, to develop their careers. That is understandable and that model has operated in Ireland for a long time. The HSE has been sending out recruiters and using social media and other methods of communication to attract nurses who left the country when there was a moratorium on recruiting public health staff, other than front-line staff. I am glad to say that we are now past that situation because of the economic recovery and this year there are between 400 and 500 extra nurses working in the HSE. </p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I agree with the Deputy that much progress is still to be made but we have come a long way from where we were at the height of the economic difficulties that befell the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">Nobody knows better than I the complexity of all of the issues involved in this. It is not just a matter of delayed discharges. The points the Tánaiste has made illustrate the Government's piecemeal approach to the overall difficulties. It is very important to recognise that capacity is critically impacted by the number of nurses available and the current number is nowhere near what is required even to deal with the situation in the here and now.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> A key contributor to the shortage of nurses is the excessive delay in the processing of registration applications. Incredibly, the registration process in this jurisdiction can take anything between six and 18 months, whereas on the neighbouring island it takes three to four weeks. While I accept that there can be difficulties in ensuring that all of the necessary documentation is to hand, it is very clear that the combination of the low levels of nursing provision and the delays in the processing of registration applications from nurses coming from overseas is creating what the INMO has described as a perfect storm in our health services. We must respond to this. It is very clear that despite the warnings to the Minister for Health and his Department, the response to this situation has been wholly inadequate. A relatively small additional complement of staff for the Nursing and Midwifery Board is simply an inadequate response at this time. </p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The Tánaiste made reference to the HSE's so-called "bring them home" campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">This campaign is not enticing the necessary numbers of Irish-trained nurses to make the return journey home. That is what the issue comes down to.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> I ask the Tánaiste, as leader of her party in the coalition partnership, what she will do to ensure the recruitment package is sufficiently incentivised. We must bear in mind the reasons many young trainee nurses gave for opting to leave Ireland. While money was not the only issue, the cuts of recent years under the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation were most certainly part of the reason they chose not to stay here. It is October and in no time the crisis that has extended from the summer period through last month and into this month will multiply. If we do not act now, we will come into very serious times.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">Again, I appreciate the Deputy's concerns. As he will know, active recruitment is taking place of as many as possible of the young nurses who are currently graduating. My understanding is that a significant number of these nurses are opting to stay in Ireland. Equally, some of them are leaving. Ongoing arrangements are in place to relocate 456 people to Ireland. A relocation package of approximately €1,500 is on offer to attract nurses back and one year of nursing registration fees will also be paid. Those returning will also be eligible for permanent positions and will be given credit for service accrued while abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> What else is in the budget to attract people home? A key element of attracting young people such as recently qualified nurses to return, one with which Sinn Féin disagreed, is the reduction in the universal social charge. The reduction will assist people at the beginning of their career who are on lower incremental rates and have not reached the top of the scale. People returning home will face a universal social charge regime under which those who are on part-time earnings of up to €13,000 will be removed from the USC net, while those who are eligible to pay the lower rates of USC will receive a reduction in the rate. People taking up a full-time position will benefit most because the higher rate of 7% has been reduced to 5.5%. </p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I am aware that Sinn Féin, in its pre-budget submission, did not opt to prioritise reducing the universal social charge for people coming home. </p>

          <p eId="para_303">With respect, I came to the Chamber to discuss nursing in a sensible and fair manner. The Tánaiste is now peddling a mistruth. Our measures provided for taking 100,000 people out of the universal social charge net. The Government's measures have only provided for removing 43,000 from the USC net. Under our submission, more would have been allocated to reducing the impact of USC than the Government did. The Tánaiste should stick with the truth. We have heard loads of rubbish from her this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">The Deputy needs to go back and study. I specifically spoke about people who, in the context of nursing incomes, could be working part-time and earning up to €13,000. That group would be lifted out of the universal social charge net entirely. The USC has also been reduced significantly for people on the lower rates. However, the real gain is for people with a medium level of take-home pay as the rate of USC they pay has fallen from 7% to 5.5%. If Deputy Ó Caoláin does not believe that it is a significant gain in take-home pay and to the money in people's pockets and purses, I must question the economics of the Sinn Féin budget proposals.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_306">On coming to power, the Government promised to break down barriers, break up the cosy cartels, open up competition, eliminate the system of nods and winks and abolish quangos. The transport industry is very important and creates large numbers of jobs. It welcomes the measures the Minister for Finance took in the budget on taxation paid on large vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Those who drive lorries must obtain a licence. In the past three or four years, a quango or cartel has developed among those who provide courses leading to a haulage licence. A cartel operating in the eastern region is preventing other companies from offering these transport courses. I contacted the Ombudsman about the issue in the past year and one company in County Leitrim has been in constant contact with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Chartered Institute of Logistics in Transport, CILT. It has also contacted the Ombudsman and its representatives are present in the Visitors Gallery. For four years, this company has been excluded from the system because it is able to offer courses for nearly half the price currently being charged by the cartel. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission wrote to me, making clear that the office is seriously concerned about what is taking place. </p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Will the Tánaiste give an undertaking that she will ensure that companies wishing to supply courses to people seeking a haulage licence will be treated fairly? Every time a letter is written about this issue, the reply states the matter is under review. A review was undertaken in 2011 but the companies seeking to compete in providing courses did not receive a response. Last year, when I wrote to the Department, I was informed again that the matter was under a review. Notwithstanding the lovely, fancy letters we receive from a Minister on this issue, it is clear the buck is being passed. </p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Approximately 80% of the work of the company which has been seeking information and trying to get on the ladder for the past four years is based in Athlone. It is interesting to note that because it raised its head above the parapet, all HGV testing in Athlone for buses and rigid and articulated trucks was suspended in the past week. Health and safety and a lack of places to turn a vehicle were the excuses given for the suspension. I know of 100 roads around Athlone where a heavy goods vehicle can be turned. I did my test in the area and have backed an articulated truck down many a road around Athlone. </p>
          <p eId="para_310"> There is something rotten, something that stinks, about what has occurred in the past four years. The Department, the Chartered Institute of Logistics in Transport and a cartel involving the suppliers of courses are caught up in a web that is keeping people out of the industry. Is the Government prepared to take on this cartel? Is it prepared to provide for fair and open competition for companies that can provide a service for nearly half the price consumers are currently paying?</p>

          <p eId="para_311">The detail of the question the Deputy asks would be better directed to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport as it concerns references to specific companies which could have been addressed if the Deputy had provided them in advance. I undertake to have the matter examined and to revert to the Deputy with a reply. I acknowledge the welcome the haulage industry has given to the changes on the cost for those in the HGV sector. We are all aware that the industry suffered heavily during the downturn and, in particular, on foot of the recession in the construction sector. In the previous budget, the Government recognised the difficulties facing the sector and announced the fuel duty rebate for hauliers which could have resulted in significant savings. In the current budget, we have significantly reduced the cost of a licence to provide for greater competition in the haulage industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">That is probably the most significant development and it has been widely welcomed by the industry. Given that he is raising issues around qualifications for those coming into the industry, the Deputy will be aware that SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills have agreed with the haulage industry to develop traineeships for new and young people coming into the industry to qualify for HGVs and employment and self-employment. The Minister for Education and Skills indicated that in some detail at the launch of the Apprenticeship Council which has an agreement not only to relaunch traditional apprenticeships but to extend apprenticeships into new areas. Those new areas include the haulage industry. I had conversations with the Minister about that. One of the forms of employment that is most attractive to unemployed people is as a licenced haulier. My Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been co-operating on that. The Deputy may have seen that in the budget an extra €10.5 million was allocated to apprenticeship education which will mean that the overall number of apprentices will increase to 6,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> In relation to the specific issues the Deputy raises, I will certainly raise them with the Department and revert to him.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_315">This is going to take intervention at a high level. The Tánaiste told me to go to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. We have had two Ministers in that Department since 2011, neither of whom has cracked this cartel. These are the facts. It has not been done. No one is making the move. There are people who it appears cannot be challenged. What is left to the people at the moment? Hynes Quinn is a company in Leitrim that is providing 20 jobs and its only option now is to challenge this in court. As politicians we should be ashamed of ourselves. The EU talks about open competition for everyone. For a small SME to have to go to court to vindicate its entitlements is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I am not talking about SOLAS or the Department of Education and Skills. I know what they do and it is very good. I am referring specifically to the fact that for four years, two Ministers have closed their eyes. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with the CILT and the quango allow a certain number of people to give a course. I am referring to people giving a course, not sitting down to get one. This little cartel is going on while other suppliers are fit to give this course around the country at nearly half the price. That would be a very good thing for the consumer and for ordinary people who need a licence to set up in the haulage industry. It is called a "haulage licence". They could get it at nearly half the price. Sadly, no one has done anything. Be it the Ombudsman or the consumer affairs commission, they do not seem to have clout. I am asking that someone takes this on at a high level to get it sorted. Nobody in the country should be forbidden from providing something that he or she is qualified to provide. He or she should at least be given the opportunity to get out there and be in competition. I ask the Minister to break this cartel. It must stop for the betterment of the haulage industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">The Deputy has not said whether he has approached the competition authority. If this matter is purely one of competition, I would expect the competition authority to be interested in it were it referred by the Deputy and others. I go back to what I said about the budget. There are a lot of young people, as the Deputy knows, who could find very good and well-paid employment in the haulage industry, particularly given the fact that the measures introduced by the Minister for Finance in the budget have made the situation for Irish hauliers far more competitive through the reduction in the tax and licence rates. As an economy, we are now poised to have very significant further economic growth. Much of that growth will have to be served by the road haulage industry. Therefore, the Government, through the Department of Education and Skills, has put in place a plan with the haulage industry to provide apprenticeships for this occupation.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">I agree with the Deputy regarding the RSA. The reports that have emerged regarding drink-driving conviction rates in certain courts are disturbing. I understand that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is examining the matter as a priority. We have seen further reports of people who, having been convicted, were involved in further accidents, some of them resulting in death and serious injury. These are important matters and the Minister will treat them as a priority. He is also seeking the advice of the Attorney General on how, where necessary, the legislation can be improved and the court and IT processes involved can ensure greater matching of data as a priority. No one driving himself, herself or his or her family wants to see people who drink and drive, particularly those who then engage in dangerous driving or have prior convictions, on the roads. They are not only a danger to themselves, but a serious risk to the health and lives of other road users.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">The Tánaiste is aware that, in recent years, with some financial institutions closing their doors and others ceasing to perform in given areas - for example, mortgages and other lending practices - they have sold, for want of a better description, their loan books or aspects thereof to other financial service providers, including some outside the jurisdiction. There is significant concern among citizens who, having gone to high street financial institutions in years past, provided all of their relevant information and data and legitimately secured their loan applications or mortgages, as the case may be. Considerable data - information on the individuals and their families - were provided to the financial institutions, but now, years later, all of that information is in the hands of other financial institutions, including some that are not registered in this State but are functioning in Ireland in a limited way and have control over the loans in question, including mortgages. This is significantly problematic.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">Yes, No. 64, the data sharing and governance Bill, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Tánaiste has a particular interest in matters fiscal. We formerly served together on one of the Oireachtas committees in this regard. I am anxious to hear her view on this issue. Have these matters been brought to her attention? Can she give us some sense of the Government's awareness of the practice? I have gone through all of the promised legislation, and this Bill, which is due for publication next year, is the only one that appears to be a fit. I am not sure that it is a neat fit, but I am anxious to know whether it would address this matter. Does the Tánaiste agree that there should be a tightening of the situation, in that data held on citizens and their families by financial institutions should not be readily available for sale on the open market?</p>

          <p eId="para_345">Data protection is important to everyone in Ireland. Financial data are some of the most sensitive data that are held on individuals, families and businesses. There was a public consultation, now completed, on the proposed legislative changes. There was also a policy paper. The preparation of legislation would be the next step. I understand that this has commenced, but it will be next year before we see any legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The Central Bank has an overriding supervisory power in respect of financial organisations. As such, the data of customers of various financial institutions or whose loans may be in transition are a matter for the Central Bank. The early stages of the legislation to which the Deputy referred are complete, but I do not anticipate that it will be before the Dáil before next year. In the meantime, the Central Bank has a mandate to oversee the regulation of the types of loan in question, namely, those that are sold on to other entities.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I rise to ask the Tánaiste a question on universal health insurance, UHI, because I cannot get proper information from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">It is a central plank of Government policy that was outlined by the two governing parties in the programme for Government after the 2011 election. We are no further on in terms of seeing any detail on universal health insurance. One should bear in mind it is an essential plank of how we are to fund the health service in the years ahead. We have had reports from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stating he is considering alternative options. The ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and KPMG are all involved in this scoping exercise but we have been scoping for five years now. The Minister is a bit like David Attenborough commentating on a herd of elephants wandering the savanna. There is almost nothing substantial in terms of policy coming from him. Every week, we hear a different view from the Minister on this issue. There was a clear commitment in the programme for Government on how we would fund our health services. We were told it would make our health services more equitable and that people would be able to gain access to health care based on need rather than their ability to pay. Despite this, the Minister consistently gives us mixed messages. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has undermined the policy and said it is unworkable. The Minister for Finance has had a go at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> With regard to the current position, could the Tánaiste give me an honest answer? This is critical in the twilight of this Dáil as we face an election. The people should certainly know what they will be voting on regarding how we are to fund health care in the years ahead. I have got no honest answer to date from the other side of the House on this central issue. I have heard about universal health care, primary care and other forms of care but I have not heard about a proper, tangible outcome in respect of our position on universal health insurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">Among other achievements, it sets out the policy on free general practitioner care for those aged under six and over 70. This has been rolled out as part of universal health care. There was a commitment, which would not have been known publicly on 7 October, to the rolling out of free general practitioner care to primary school children, or children aged 11 and under. It refers to the development throughout the country of primary care centres, which are now providing an alternative to longer stays in hospitals and minor procedures. This is one reason there is such demand for beds but the new models will mean we will be less hospital dependent and more able to provide what is required, particularly regarding procedures at local level. We will also be able to provide free general practitioner care for those aged under six and over 70 and, next year, children of 11 and under. I am sure the Deputy and his party would welcome all that.</p>

They were very appreciative of the various improvements that have been made for hauliers and of the specific commitment to training more young people so they may enter the industry. They were also appreciative of the well-paid employment and careers the sector potentially offers. With regard to the legislation the Deputy mentioned, I understand it will not be before the House until some time next year. In the meantime, I strongly suggest to Deputies Bannon and Fitzmaurice that they submit a Topical Issue matter on what is clearly a significant matter of concern to them.</p>

Not one bilingual version has been produced since then. This has hampered my ability and that of others to take part in debates in the House as Gaeilge.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">On behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their constructive engagement with the Bill. I look forward to a more detailed consideration of the provisions on Committee Stage. Before he left the Chamber, the Minister told me that he is looking forward to that engagement because many important points were made during the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I would now like to wrap up this debate. As Members will appreciate, this Bill is mainly of a technical nature and is designed principally to facilitate the implementation of the EU financial services agenda. As Members are aware, the banking union has been probably the most high-profile EU legislative issue over recent years. It was seen as a necessary response to the financial crisis and its purpose is to put in place a more integrated and harmonised supervisory and resolution regime for the euro area banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> At this stage, progress on the creation of a European banking union is at an advanced stage. The European Central Bank, ECB, took over its supervisory role in November last year and is working closely with national authorities ensuring that banks comply with EU banking legislation. This was an important first step on the road to a banking union as centralised supervision should ensure a high level of independence and objectivity and will help to rebuild trust and confidence in the European banking sector. It is very important that trust and confidence in the European banking sector are rebuilt.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> The next step was to ensure that if a bank gets into trouble there are appropriate tools and powers to manage the failure in an orderly manner. In this regard, it was agreed that a Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM, would be established for this purpose. This should ensure an effective European response where a bank finds itself in serious difficulties. However, as the Minister noted, for the Single Resolution Mechanism to be operationalised, it is necessary to ratify the intergovernmental agreement to the Single Resolution Mechanism and lodge the necessary documentation with the EU by 30 November. The importance of completing this process on time cannot be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Members made a number of points during the debate which the Minister will deal with on Committee Stage. The rationale behind the main amendment to the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 seems to me to be clear and straightforward. Its purpose is to ensure the scheme continues to have access to a reasonable level of resources as we move from the old regime to the new rules under Directive 2014/49/EU, which is being transposed. This is important from a confidence perspective as while the likelihood of the fund being used is quite small, it does provide an important reassurance to depositors that deposit guarantee scheme funding is available if needed, as has been demonstrated in the cases of IBRC and Berehaven Credit Union. That was commented on by several Deputies in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The Minister made clear why we need to legislate for the insurance continuation provisions, in that in their absence there would be no regulatory regime for insurance undertakings outside the scope of the Solvency II directive. I believe there will be an appreciation in this House that with the difficulties we have had with insurance companies, this legislation is essential to protect the position of policyholders. That was mentioned by many Deputies during the debate and it will be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> The amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 is a technical amendment to remove any potential ambiguity from existing legislation, and from a substance perspective, therefore, it is not designed to change the underlying intention behind the original provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> As the Minister indicated at the outset, he will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage that will add an additional Part to this Bill. This will be a minor, but important, amendment that will alter section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which contains provisions relating to the Revenue Commissioners' treatment of confidential taxpayer information. Its purpose is to allow Revenue to disclose confidential taxpayer information to the Law Society of Ireland in certain limited circumstances and, where a tax adviser or agent is a solicitor, to ensure equal treatment across the broad range of tax advisers. I hope that when we discuss this proposal on Committee Stage, the House will be able to approve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I hope there will be an opportunity to discuss the other matters raised by Deputies as the Bill continues its progress through the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_414">As I was saying before I rudely interrupted myself yesterday, there is context to this legislation. While referring to the Bill, I am keen to elaborate on the issue of social solidarity because the term was used a good deal in the context of bringing forward this emergency legislation between 2008 and 2011 and asking the people to make inordinate sacrifices to adjust the public finances. In the context of the adjustment of the public finances, another issue had to be addressed. This was the adjustment to and the repair of the balance sheets of our banks. That required the investment of vast sums of money into the banks by the taxpayers and the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> When we discuss the difficulties and trauma this country has experienced, often we forget that many players were responsible for the downturn in the economy. There were many international circumstances and factors. Of course, these were always ignored in this House by some political parties. The difficulties we faced related to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the international credit squeeze, the locking out of access to international markets and the difficulties Irish banks had at the time in trying to access wholesale money markets on a short-term basis. Furthermore, there has been a move away from traditional banking practices in recent years. Previously, banks used to take in deposits, lend money out and charge a margin. That system was overtaken and we were into a situation where banks funded loans on the wholesale money markets. That is fine while there is a continual flow of funding but the moment it stops, banks are immediately impaired. That happened here in 2008 and the consequences were catastrophic. I refer here to the bank guarantee and all that flowed from it. There has been a continual discourse. The banking inquiry, which has held its meetings in the bowels of this Parliament for the past year or so, has investigated the matter in detail. I imagine it will make recommendations and finalise a report sometime in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Through all of this, members of the public have asked questions on a regular basis as to why certain individuals were asked to make major contributions to the readjustment in the public finances. They are probably wondering why it now seems to be a case of business as usual again. There is a good deal of justifiable anger because we have asked the people to carry a major burden. That burden has been lightened in recent times in terms of improvements in the economy, unemployment dropping, changes to the FEMPI legislation, the Lansdowne Road agreement, pension levies and the recent budget as well. However, there remains a concern that nothing has happened, that nothing has changed and that it is business as usual for many of the banks. For example, let us consider a person who took out a loan between 2005 and 2007 - the height of the property boom - and purchased a house. That person could have rightfully assumed that his income would be X for the foreseeable future, only to find that his income was no longer X but was in fact Y because the State had taken a substantial amount of that money in order to shove it into the banks. These same people were defaulting on their mortgages yet we find that the banks, which they had helped to save by extraordinary effort and sacrifice, are now penalising and punishing them on a continual basis. One need only visit any court in the land to see the number of repossessions being pursued. It is simply disgusting. Something has to be done to rectify this if we are to have genuine social solidarity and if we are to be a republic where everyone has a fair crack at the whip. In any event, the fact that these institutions, which were supported by this Parliament through legislation and funded by the people, are now viciously assaulting that social solidarity is repellent. Repossessions occur on a regular basis. The banks dismiss people's trials and tribulations with regard to the financial difficulties in which they find themselves. It is business as usual and that is simply wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I recall occasions when a number of Labour Party Deputies who used to sit on this side of the House but who are now on the benches opposite consistently accused the then Government of not jailing bankers and not having them all locked up. The bottom line is that it is almost five years since the current Administration entered office but I do not see anyone being imprisoned in Mountjoy for mismanaging or damaging the economy or misappropriating funds. There seems to be little responsibility or culpability accepted. I have no difficulty in accepting my share of culpability. In fact, I have accepted it. That matter was adjudicated by the people in 2011. However, it is business as usual for many of the same people. They are back in business. Indeed, the institutions are back in business in a harsh way.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> When we discuss FEMPI legislation and lightening the burden on people, we need to be mindful of the untold damage that is being done on a continual basis to ordinary people. All they wanted to do was buy a house, put a roof over their heads and those of their family members and go through life in the normal way with normal hopes, dreams and aspirations. They are callously being cut away every day by the same institutions that limply, lamely and deceitfully walked into Government Buildings and asked for a handout from the people. Indeed, those institutions got a very large handout.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> We often discuss FEMPI, sacrifices and burden-sharing. However, I do not see much burden-sharing when I witness the daily carry-on in the courts in respect of repossessions. People are being dragged over the coals and their hopes and aspirations are being completely shattered while the lads are back in the corporate boxes again. That is simply not acceptable, particularly if we are to have a society in which everyone is to have a fair hope that their aspirations and general outlook on life can be accommodated. The people who bought homes at the height of the market were not buying for any reason other than that they wanted to put a roof over their heads. These were no investment properties, these were their homes. The thuggery going on in terms of repossessions is something that I find most distasteful. It is happening as we speak in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> I welcome all the provisions in the Bill in terms of lightening the burden placed on people and the public service in the context of the FEMPI legislation and the very deep and harsh cuts that were made. It is a little raw for those in government to say they are lightening the load on people now when 300,000 individuals with variable mortgages are still being charged exorbitant interest rates and when the banks are inclined to ignore the pleas of the Minister and this Administration. These banks are literally extorting money from their customers at exorbitant interest rates and if those customers cannot pay up, then the banks will head down to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> What is happening in this country in terms of repossessions is quite disgusting. Those in banks will provide all the figures about mortgage resolution mechanisms and everything that goes with it but, ultimately, it is they who decide who stays in the house and who does not. They are the people who decide whether an individual is entitled to his dreams and aspirations. These corporate entities should be brought to heel by the Government in terms of the way they are dealing with individuals on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> When those in government start to lighten the burden, they should not applaud themselves and point out that people have been very good to take the medicine and that the Government is now helping them in their recuperation. The Government should be mindful of the fact that the public has not forgotten that they went through difficult times to bail out institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Those institutions seem to be oblivious to the misery and suffering on a daily basis in this country, in terms of the repossessions and the extortionate variable rates charged for mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> We may also accept that there are only two lending institutions in this country with regard to credit flows. I do not believe there is a proper competitive edge in the marketplace. The Minister for Finance will tell people to move mortgages, but it is very difficult for families, who are under major stress and pressure, to try to find other lending institution to move mortgages to. I meet families every day of the week in my clinics, and I am quite sure if the Minister of State holds clinics he meets families who are finding it exceptionally difficult to make progress in terms of resolutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_425"> The changes to FEMPI will be welcomed by the people, but we should also be conscious of the fact that many people who carry burdens are still suffering. While this might lighten their load to a certain extent, other corporate institutions in the country are crushing people on a daily basis. That shameful activity must stop.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">The reality, as Deputy Kelleher knows, is that our election manifesto in 2011 was quite clear. This Bill is welcome. I speak as a public servant who has spent all of his life teaching and being involved in a voluntary capacity with organisations dealing with disability. I fully understand the role played by public sector workers and their families in our communities as we as a country rose above the economic catastrophe that befell us.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> This debate is about pay restoration, and that is why it is important to acknowledge and thank our public servants. They are the men and women who have had to endure two and, in some cases, three pay cuts. We must acknowledge the sacrifice they and their families have made as they assisted the Government in bringing the country back from the brink. That required a gargantuan effort by the people, but the Government has had a plan to fix our economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_433"> We may be the fastest-growing economy in Europe, which makes for wonderful reading and a great banner headline, but we must now ensure that translates into the lives of every citizen, no matter where they are from. They should feel the benefit of our economic recovery. </p>
          <p eId="para_434"> There is a narrative espoused by certain commentators about the public service. I remind such people that public servants are the men and women of our Defence Forces, Garda Síochána, nurses, teachers and first responders, to name just some. They are also the men and women who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas and provide a valuable service to the nation. When people are in trouble, they look for help from those working in community welfare offices, which provide a last refuge or first port of call for many of our citizens. </p>
          <p eId="para_435"> When I hear members of the Fourth Estate pouring scorn and derision on our public servants, I often ask myself whether they know about whom they are writing or talking. The great mantra is that public servants have permanent and pensionable jobs. I ask the people who write in our newspapers and commentators whether they would do the work of a garda at 3 a.m., a first responder to an accident or a nurse working in an ICU ward.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The Bill before us is symbolic in that it reflects how we as a nation have come on a journey. As the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said, it is about arising from the fiscal emergency to support middle and low-income earners. That is why it is important. I appeal to the ASTI, in particular, to reconsider its decision on pay talks. It has a duty to reballot its members in the context of a larger number who may vote in a future ballot.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I am acutely aware of the major imposition of the past ten years on many workers, be they in the private or public sector. People have lost their jobs, had their livelihoods decimated and their quality of life severely damaged. Thankfully, we are beginning to emerge into a better place as a country. It is important that we recognise that the future is about quality of life, balancing the pay recovery and sustaining and improving our public finances, which offer us an opportunity to bring about reform in how we as a country do our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Deputy Kelleher and I are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I wish to focus on health. We have seen progress in areas such as the national children's hospital, how we treat patients and carry out procedures, Healthy Ireland and the introduction of free GP care for those aged under six and over 70 years. They are just some of the measures about which I want to speak. </p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Deputy Kelleher and I may have a difference of opinion on how we achieve what we want to achieve in health, but we all want to see a health system that is based upon the medical needs of patients, rather than what is in their pockets. We need to take time to arrive at a universal health service. Unfortunately, the health system is not like a car. If it breaks down one cannot bring it to a garage, put it up on a ramp and give it a service. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> The health system is demand-led and people-centred, and cannot be stopped and overhauled. Changes have to be carried out incrementally. We have succeeded in increasing the health budget and have seen greater investment in information technology, which I hope will see projects like e-referrals proceeding, waiting lists being put online and the issuing of the first individual health identifier. </p>
          <p eId="para_441"> It is important that we examine how hospital groups can bring profound and real change to the delivery of our health care model. Equally, it is important that we acknowledge that the journey for our health system will continue, in particular in the area of primary care. </p>
          <p eId="para_442"> New primary care units have opened. A societal change is required in our attitude towards what is seen as the first port of call, namely, emergency departments. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children I have become a major proponent of the need for primary care as an alternative to accessing hospitals as a first port of call. Work is done in hospitals which can be done in primary care units, and such work should be expedited and prioritised.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> Today we have signs of progress in the Oireachtas, with this Bill in the Dáil and, in the Seanad, the final legislative programme piece on the road to marriage equality. This morning the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny of the adoption (tracing and information) Bill, which will give those who require information that has been denied them for so long the opportunity to obtain it. Reform is taking place and change is happening in Ireland. We are trying to make Ireland a better place, cast aside the darkness of the past, deal with the legacy issues and allow people to flourish and become the best they can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I often wonder about some of the people opposite - not Deputy Kelleher, I have to say - who engage in absolute populism. This week I was on local radio with a particular person who was populist, to say the least, who had no policy or alternative but opposed everything and gave a message that everything could be better in a faraway place. Populism does not create policy, fix the economy or lend itself to creating jobs, and it certainly did not challenge the economic uncertainties that we had. Has the Government achieved everything we wanted to achieve? Of course we have not. Have we made mistakes? Yes we have, but the important point is that we are trying and have succeeded in creating employment, fixing the economy and offering hope to people. That is what the Bill is about: offering hope for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The plan now must be to use the increasing resources we receive to benefit those who most need them, whether in the area of disability, and autism in particular, or in any other area. I hope the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will look at the area of autism and how we can provide services for those children and adults who require them. We must look at this in the long term with regard to how we can prepare for those school leavers who will come into society with a real need. There is also the area of public health, particularly the Healthy Ireland initiative, and how we can promote a different type of health system and a way of looking at the whole aspect of health in the context of obesity, smoking and the sale of alcohol Bill, which is to be a priority before we go to the country for an election.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> If I may digress for a second, Laverne McGuinness, the deputy director general of the HSE, is to leave her post, and on the floor of the Chamber I acknowledge her contribution and commitment to public service and I thank her. She is a person of great experience and commitment who will be missed in the HSE, and I thank her for her commitment and service.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> In his remarks Deputy Kelleher made reference to the banks, and I must say I agree with much of what he said. We saw the banks being given very generous assistance by the Irish people. They now have an obligation to work with people to keep them in their homes, lend to business and create employment. We must look at the issue of the banks in terms of how they engage with people. I very much echo Deputy Kelleher's serious call for them to stop dealing with some people in a particular way. There are some people who do not engage with the banks, and we cannot condone this, but those who do and make a decent effort to meet the banks' requirements should not be forced into court or be forced to do anything under duress or with fear. It is important that the banks recognise this. We have made huge sacrifices as a people, and now the banks we assisted have an obligation and duty to work with people.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> When we meet the banks they often tell us about their great figures, and sometimes their figures do not add up to reality. Every day all of us meet people in our constituency offices and clinics who have issues with overdrafts being reduced. I met a small business person who was told the other day that his overdraft was being stopped for no apparent reason. Every week we meet people in our offices who have issues with how they can work with the banks to repay their mortgages. It is important that the banks work with all of us to ensure we keep people in their homes and, in particular, to see how they can assist the construction sector and work with people to provide capital where we need to build private and social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> As a positive, we as a country have been creating 1,300 jobs a week in 2015. Since the Action Plan for Jobs came into being, 125,000 jobs have been created. Our unemployment rate has decreased to 9.5% from a height in 2012 of 15.1%. These people are back at work. If one travels the roads of Cork city one sees queues of people going to work in the morning in the industrial park at the end of Curraheen Road and City Gate in Mahon, and one sees the investment in One Albert Quay in the city. There is a tailback of traffic down to the harbour with people going to work in the pharmaceutical industry. People are being employed and jobs are being created. What we must do now is ensure that the jobs that are being created are sustainable and that we allow people to have a quality of life commensurate with what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Last week, the budget reduced the contribution that people will pay in the form of the universal social charge, and we all very much welcome this. We have seen the minimum wage increase twice under the Government. It is about people being at work, a value and a job. The past eight years have been painful, stressful and deeply difficult for our people but they have, with the Government, risen to the task, which is why it is important to acknowledge the Bill today.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> I will make reference to another issue. Today we as a country are finally passing the Marriage Bill in the Seanad, and it is imperative that we celebrate this great achievement. Next year we will celebrate the anniversary of our Rising. We are a very beloved people throughout the world. Today, our President is in the United States meeting various interest groups celebrating the Irishness and uniqueness that we bring to the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> In passing this legislation, it is important that we recognise the role and work done by our public servants. It is not about pitting private against public; it is about recognising the work all of us in society do that contributes to a better and more equal Ireland. Our economic recovery means we will have more money at our disposal, and this money must be used to ensure the recovery is sustainable for the next generation, that we never have to go back to the days of the past and that we never have to see the type of auction politics engaged in previously. It is about ensuring there is clarity in the run-up to the next election and that those on the far side of the House recognise that there is a better way of doing government, which is the way the Government has done it over the past four and a half years in putting our people first. Sometimes Sinn Féin really baffles me with its voodoo economics, because if we look at their policy regarding public sector pay, it really is all over the place. In Stormont in 2012 it implemented a two-year pay freeze for 12,000 civil servants earning more than £21,000, which equates to approximately €24,000. It also cut 22,000 jobs this year in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">It tried to capitalise on the Haddington Road agreement process here by opposing it. What is its policy? As the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, stated recently, the party wants to recruit 250 hospital consultants on less pay. The difficulty we have in recruiting staff for the health system is that we must ensure we can retain them on levels of pay that will not force them to go abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> I welcome the Bill and I am delighted I had the opportunity to speak on it. I speak as a public servant and I am very proud of what our men and women do in the public service. I know this is a step on the road to recovery. Like Deputy Kelleher, I will mention our banks, which must again begin to work with people. I should not name banks, I suppose, but we know the AIB advertisement to the effect that it is working with people. Let us see the banks working in collaboration with people so we can bring about a better and more prosperous country, where we can all live in our own homes or houses provided by the State. That is the next step in the Construction 2020 project, which we need to see expedited as well.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Ann Phelan)<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">I thank the Deputies for their contributions and support for this legislation. The Bill before us is not lengthy but it has very important consequences. I will briefly summarise three of the main issues it addresses regarding the pay and pensions of serving and retired public servants. The first is pay restoration. All serving public servants stand to benefit from these reductions in the cuts from the 2009 and 2013 Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts, but importantly, the lower-paid stand to benefit more, proportionally speaking. The second is the pension-related deduction. This additional levy on the wages of public servants has been in place for six years and this Bill reduces the amount payable for the first time. Just as the levy was applicable across the board, so too is this new measure. This is in keeping with the Government’s emphasis on fair and equitable treatment for all. The final issue is the public service pension reduction, which has been applied to the majority of public servants, at varying rates, since 2011. The amelioration of this measure by the Bill is done in such a way that not only do all benefit from the restoration, but it also ensures that through appropriate calibration of rates, all benefit proportionally. No one group is singled out for either preferential or prejudicial treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I will now address some of the specific issues raised by the Deputies. I thank Deputy Sean Fleming for his support and welcome his contribution to the discussion. I will address the main issues he raised, leaving the remainder for Committee Stage. The Deputy inquires as to whether the lower incremental scales for new entrants to the public service, introduced at the beginning of 2012, can be adjusted. The answer is simple, as they already have been adjusted. As part of the Haddington Road agreement, public servants had the 10% reduced scales merged into pre-existing scales in November 2013, so all new entrants could gradually achieve parity with existing gardaí, nurses, teachers, civil servants and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Deputy Fleming also referred to the concerns of the Association of Retired Public Servants. I assure him that the Government is fully aware of those concerns and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have continually maintained an open dialogue with them throughout this process. The approach adopted in ameliorating the public service pension reduction focused the majority of relief on impacted public servants in receipt of relatively lower pensions. This approach will achieve a result whereby the significant majority of retired public servants will be exempt from the public service pension reduction from 2018 onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Having noted this, the required fiscal recovery is not complete and we are not yet at a stage where we can remove-----</p>

        <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_242" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_459">The required fiscal recovery is not complete and we are not yet at a stage where we can remove the financial emergency measures for all public service pensioners. It is estimated that from 1 January 2018, in the region of 25,000 retired public servants in receipt of pensions substantially higher than the average public servant’s pension will continue to be subject to pension reductions. Quite properly, the pension reductions imposed remain larger for public service pensions of higher value.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> There is the more general question of this country's financial status and whether the word "emergency", as used in the title of this Bill, is still relevant or apt. The Bill has this title because it is mainly concerned with amending the previous FEMPI Acts. Given the extremely promising signs of economic recovery that we are seeing, the Deputy wishes the Government to declare the emergency over, but we cannot do that. Certainly, the end is in sight and we have come very far from where the last Government had landed us but that is all the more reason to remain cautious and not jeopardise the recovery for which we have all worked so hard. As was outlined yesterday, this restoration is being done responsibly, and part of that responsibility is to not rush and declare the job done. Instead, this Government is patiently staying the course.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Several Deputies have suggested that more should have been done for lower-paid public servants. The position is that the Bill gives effect to the provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement, which was reached following extensive consultation with trade unions representing all public servants, including lower-paid public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions accepted the terms of the agreement on 16 September 2015. Any deviation from the agreement at this juncture would seriously undermine the agreement and potentially cause significant industrial relations difficulties. The agreement has been crafted in such a fashion as to ensure that lower paid public servants gain most from the application of the terms of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Deputies will be aware that these measures are being introduced at a time when the country is emerging from the economic crisis, but the Government is clear that it must continue to be prudent with budget expenditure. Notwithstanding this, the Bill contains specific measures to address those on annualised salaries of less than €24,000, who will receive a 2.5% increase in addition to a flat €1,000 increase and those on annualised salaries between €24,001 and €31,000 will receive a 1% increase in addition to the €1,000 flat rate increase. Moreover, lower paid public servants will benefit from the reduced pension-related deduction rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The issue of additional working hours has also been raised. While not a matter that is addressed in this Bill, it is the case that this measure brought public servants into line with industry norms in the context of working hours. Even with this measure, the public service continues to offer a wide range of family-friendly schemes to its staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Deputy Daly has made a point regarding the situation of teachers, specifically in relation to statements by the ASTI or TUI regarding the Lansdowne Road agreement regarding accusations of bullying by the Government. First, it must be made clear that sections 4 and 10 of this Act, which deal with the increment freeze and the ability to increase pay in certain circumstances respectively, are by no means targeted at teachers. Rather they are general provisions dealing with non-compliance with the terms of collective agreements and represent measures included in the FEMPI 2013 Act, which are now being amended to accommodate the extension of the Haddington Road agreement through the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The Government’s position on this matter is very straightforward. All unions abiding by the terms of the Haddington Road agreement, and the Lansdowne Road agreement which extends it, regarding workplace reform and so forth, will continue to enjoy the protections and benefits of those agreements. These would include such things as being excluded from the more severe increment freeze and the payment of allowances where they have been previously agreed. Obviously, should any union not comply with the terms of the agreement, it would be extremely difficult to justify their gaining from it, particularly in light of the sacrifices made by their fellow public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> All unions and associations were invited into these discussions, with those in ICTU operating under the auspices of the public services committee of ICTU and its processes. That the vast majority of public servants have accepted this agreement by aggregate vote was confirmed by the public services committee on 16 September 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Deputy McDonald has argued that the Bill is too generous to higher paid public servants. I have three points to make by way of answer to this. The Lansdowne Road agreement, and this Bill which gives effect to it, are very much geared towards benefitting the lower paid more, proportionally speaking. It should be noted by the House that those public servants earning over €65,000 will not receive the extra €1,000 in September 2017 and that those very few earning over €110,000 will not receive the full restoration of the cuts imposed on them in 2013 until 2019. However, it is the view of this Government that since all public servants have endured the measures imposed by the five FEMPI Acts, it is only right and equitable that all should now stand to benefit from the partial and phased restoration that this Bill will bring about.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> While the 2013 higher pay cuts are being restored over time in these measures the full effect of the 2009 and 2010 reductions will remain in place in 2019. To give an example, the pay of the Taoiseach was some €285,000 in 2008. It is currently just over a net €168,000. When the restoration measures contained in this bill are completed in 2019 that pay will then be a net €182,175, still well below the 2008 level.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Finally, and in support of what I have just said, the FEMPI Acts are predicated on the sharing of the burden across all levels. If this Bill were to exclude the higher paid, the Government would surely be opening itself to a legal challenge regarding the equitability of its measures. Deputy Creighton argued that we should not give any pay increase to public servants and should instead put the money into increasing services. The only way to do this would be to put money into significantly increasing the numbers employed in the public service. She went on to argue that we should do away with blanket increases for all public servants and instead switch to a model of paying by performance payments and bonuses. She maintained that the vast majority of public servants would welcome such a move because they would fare better under such a system with better payments. However, if the numbers employed are increased and the pay model is changed to give the majority of staff more money, we will once again have a runaway pay bill. It is not so much the political philosophy as the arithmetic which is clearly suspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> I believe that I have now substantively covered the points raised by the Deputies. This Bill gives the Government the statutory basis to make good on the commitments made under the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements, both of which are vital components in the reform and renewal of our public services. I believe it is right and fair that we honour those agreements, and that we give something back to those public servants, serving and retired, who contributed so much during our country’s financial emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The crisis Ireland has endured has made us wary as a nation, wary of give-aways and poor planning. This is why the Government has been so careful to ensure that the reductions effected by this Bill are done in a way that is fully sustainable going forward. We believe that restoration must be accompanied by responsibility. I thank the House for its support and initial comments and look forward to detailed discussion on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I am glad to have the opportunity today to outline the provisions in the ninth Bill in the electoral area brought forward by this Government. This short Bill contains three measures, each separate and distinct. The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015 provides, as the name suggests, for amendments to existing electoral law. The need for these amendments has become apparent in the operation of the relevant provisions in electoral law. The Bill was described in summary in the autumn legislation programme published last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> It provides for the continuation of the existing arrangements for candidate entitlement to free postage at Seanad university member elections, when the household distribution provision for Dáil elections is commenced. It provides for the Association of Irish Local Government to be included in the register of nominating bodies for Seanad panel member elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">It also provides that persons who become Irish citizens after the qualifying date for the register of electors may apply for entry in the supplement to the register of electors to have their new citizenship status recognised. Entry in the supplement would entitle them to vote at all elections and referendums arising before the next relevant register is prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> I will elaborate now on the provisions in the Bill. The first provision relates to the entitlement to free postage for candidates at elections in the Seanad university constituencies. The Electoral Acts provide that candidates at presidential and Dáil elections, and elections in the Seanad university constituencies, are entitled to send an item of election communication to each person on the register of electors, free of postage charge. The postage costs are met by the State. The communication issued is colloquially known as the "litir um thoghchán", and I think it is so labelled by An Post. Under these provisions and where more than one person is registered at the same address, multiple copies of the same item of post are sent to that address. This is unnecessarily costly and wasteful.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> In line with the Government's commitment to achieve efficiencies and reduce Government spending, the necessary provision to allow for household distribution of the litir um thoghchán at European elections was commenced in 2014. This generated estimated savings of €2.5 million in the cost to the State of running the 2014 European elections. It is now the Minister's intention to commence section 78(a) of the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for household distribution of the litir um thoghchán at Dáil elections. The potential savings at a general election are estimated at €3.6 million, based on the same number of candidates availing of the facility as in 2011 and with similar postage costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The commencement of section 78(a) of the Electoral Act 1997 will amend section 57 of the Electoral Act 1992, which is also applied to Seanad elections by section 25 of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937. However, household distribution would not be workable for elections in the Seanad university constituencies, as registration in those constituencies is on an individual basis. The Bill therefore inserts a provision into the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937 to provide that candidates at elections in the Seanad university constituencies may send, free of postage charge, one election communication to each registered elector in the constituency. This effectively provides for the continuation of the existing arrangements for elections in the Seanad university constituencies and it mirrors the existing provision for Dáil elections in section 57 of the Electoral Act 1992. The necessary provisions are made in section 1 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The second provision in the Bill relates to nominating bodies for Seanad panel member elections. The Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 Act provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register of bodies entitled to nominate persons to panels of candidates for the election of 43 members of the Seanad, as provided for in the Constitution. This register is renewed annually in accordance with the provisions in the Act. The Act provides for the bodies representing local government to be registered each year automatically - that is, without application. The bodies named in the Act are the Irish county councils' general council, which was most recently known as the Association of County and City Councils, and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland. In 2014, following the reforms in local government, the two bodies representing local government, the Association of County and City Councils and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, merged to become the Association of Irish Local Government. That association is not named in the 1947 Act and there is no provision in that Act for a successor body to the previous bodies to be included in the register of nominating bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> The current register of nominating bodies came into force on 21 March 2015 and, even though there has been no policy change as such, the body representing local government in Ireland is not included in the register of nominating bodies for Seanad panel member elections. This is an inadvertent consequence of the changes in local government that took place in 2014 and one that is being addressed in this Bill. The Bill provides, in section 2, for the amendment of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 to provide that the Association of Irish Local Government shall be registered, without application, in respect of the administrative panel in the register of nominating bodies for Seanad panel member elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> Pending the next annual revision of the register, in March 2016, the Bill also provides, in section 2(c), for the Association of Irish Local Government to be registered in the register of nominating bodies which came into effect on 21 March 2015. It provides for the publication of a notice in this regard in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> by the Seanad returning officer. Section 2 also makes consequential amendments to sections 27 and 58 of the 1947 Act. The effect of all of the amendments is to replace the references in the 1947 Act to the Irish county councils' general council and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland with a reference to the Association of Irish Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The third provision in the Bill is about application for entry in the supplement to the register of electors by persons who become Irish citizens. The three requirements for voter registration are age, residence in a constituency and citizenship. One's citizenship dictates what elections one can vote in.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> Since 1992, arrangements have been in place for persons not on the register of electors to be entered in a supplement to the register so that they can vote at an election or referendum taking place before the next register comes into force. Initially, persons would have had to meet the necessary requirements on the qualifying date for the register in any year, that is, 1 September. The supplement provisions were modified in 1997 and again in 2001 to provide that persons reaching 18 years of age, changing address or moving constituency after the qualifying date could apply for entry in the register. However, no modification was ever made to provide for a person whose citizenship changed after the qualifying date to apply to be entered in the supplement to the register of electors. The Minister is proposing that this anomaly be addressed now. The Bill provides that a person who becomes an Irish citizen after the qualifying date for the register of electors can apply for entry in the supplement. This means that those who become Irish citizens will not have to wait for a full turnaround of the register of electors to be registered to vote at all elections and referendums. They will be entitled to apply for entry in the supplement to the register and to have their new citizenship status recognised and so be entitled to vote at an election or referendum taking place before the next relevant register of electors comes into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The new provisions are set out in section 3 of the Bill, which substitutes section 15(1A) of the Electoral Act 1992. The new section 15(1A) repeats the provisions in the existing section and includes the new provision that a person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register of electors if he or she was not a citizen of Ireland on the qualifying date, that is, 1 September each year, for the register of electors and subsequently became a citizen of Ireland. Such applications could be from persons who were never registered to vote. They could also be from persons already registered to vote, for example, as local government or European electors, who wish to change their registration details and so be entitled to vote at all elections and referendums.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Finally, I want to signal to Members that I will bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage. The amendment will provide for the introduction of a revised format for the ballot paper used at Dáil elections. I hope the changes proposed will receive the support of all Members of the Oireachtas and I look forward to the new format of the ballot paper being used at the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The Minister committed to a review of the ballot paper in this House in April last. At that time, Deputy Stanton raised concerns about voters misplacing their marks on the ballot paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">At present, political party emblems are placed along the left-hand side of the ballot paper. In the case of non-party candidates the space for the emblem is required to be left blank. It is reported that some voters express their voting preferences by placing their marks in these boxes in the left-hand column. While it is understood that such marks may not necessarily make a ballot paper invalid, any potential confusion should be eliminated, where possible. Following the review of the format of the referendum ballot paper earlier this year, Department officials also consulted with the National Adult Literacy Association and the National Council for the Blind in the review of the Dáil election ballot paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The revised form of the ballot paper should help voters avoid misplacing voting preferences and it should be more user-friendly for voters with visual and literacy difficulties. The main change proposed is to move the space for including the emblem of a political party from the left-hand side of the ballot paper to a new location to the left of the photograph. There will, therefore, be no boxes along the left-hand side of the ballot paper. This should help voters avoid misplacing voting preferences, given that there will be only one box that can be marked for each candidate after voters have read across, from left to right, all the information on each candidate. In addition, italics and parentheses will be removed from the front of the ballot paper and the wording on the back of the ballot paper and the counterfoil will be in both Irish and English.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> As I said at the outset, this is an amending Bill containing three separate and distinct measures. Each of the measures in the Bill is important in itself. On Committee Stage, the Minister will propose that a fourth measure, on the Dáil ballot paper, be added. The Bill seeks to resolve issues that have arisen in the course of the operation of the electoral codes. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_494">As the Minister said, the Bill contains three minor provisions, namely, an amendment to the Electoral Act to provide for the newly named Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, to be included in the register of nominating bodies for Seanad panel member elections; an amendment allowing candidates for the Seanad university panel the right to a free post for each household in their constituencies; and, perhaps most important, an amendment allowing newly qualified Irish citizens the right to apply for entry in the supplement to the register of electors. This is a necessary change for people who become citizens after the register of electors has closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> We support the Bill in principle, although it contains very little as it stands. We support and welcome the amendments the Minister will introduce which will change the format of election ballot papers and eliminate possible confusion over where voters should place their preferences. However, if the Bill is the sum total of the ambition of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Government for electoral and Seanad reform, it is a very sad indictment of the Government's inaction during recent years. The Bill should have represented an opportunity to reform the archaic and duplicated electoral register before the coming election. It should also have been an opportunity to reform the administration of elections by taking steps to establish the independent electoral commission that has been promised for four and a half years.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Once again, the Minister and Government are taking the path of least resistance and declining to introduce any meaningful reform, despite the Government’s promise of a democratic revolution since its inception. The Bill also, unfortunately, represents another lost opportunity to introduce Seanad reform which would not have involved constitutional change. The Seanad needs to be a more representative body and should have a role as a check on Government power to scrutinise national and EU legislation. The Manning report, as well as Fianna Fáil proposals, offered an immediate legislative route to help to achieve those goals, and could have been implemented by the Minister over the coming weeks. However, it is clear that the Government will, once again, let political reform slip off its agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> On the need to reform the supplementary register, I had hoped the amendment in the Bill would have raised an important point about how unnecessarily complicated the voter registration system is. Being included in the supplementary register is a complicated and time consuming process for anyone, not least someone who is relatively new to the country. We must question whether it has to be this complicated. While voter and electoral register fraud must be guarded against, the current system for registering voters, especially the supplementary and change of address register, is cumbersome, inefficient and out of date. People applying to the supplementary register due to a change in address, for example, often remain on the register in the previous constituency in which they resided, resulting in much duplication on the register. There is no reason an online and postal system could not be introduced for the supplementary register, as in another countries. It would be more efficient and accessible for most people as opposed to the current process by which a citizen must visit a library to get a form, visit a Garda station to have it stamped and then send it to his or her local authority franchise office.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> There is a dire need to reform the administration of elections. Although there is almost universal consensus on this need, no action on reforming the administration of elections has been taken, despite repeated promises by the Minister and his colleagues. Although the Minister has continually promised reform, the single reform proposed to election administration has been the change the format of the ballot paper which, although welcome, is only a drop in the ocean of the reform required. The Minister has questions to answer about why he and his officials have done nothing to forward the reform of electoral administration, despite four and a half years of promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> A new, independent electoral commission is required to take responsibility for the administration of elections and amalgamate responsibilities for the management of our electoral process, which is dispersed across several bodies, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, 31 local authorities and a host of different agencies such as the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, the register of parties, the Constituency Commission, the Referendum Commission and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. The franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has, unfortunately, shown itself to be unwilling to address failures in electoral administration and elections. For example, when asked by the Constitutional Convention what measures the Department has taken to clean up the electoral register, the franchise section responded that “the electoral register is not at present the subject of detailed scrutiny in the Department”. The Minister has continually pushed away action on the issue, arguing that more reports and investigations are required rather than taking proactive measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Again, the franchise section of the Department has been remarkably disengaged, admitting in public that increasing the electoral turnout is not a priority for the Department. In response to concerns submitted to the Department by the Constitutional Convention over the levels of voter turnout at elections, the Department responded that “the question of measures to improve voter turnout is not at present the subject of detailed scrutiny in the Department”. There has been a complete dereliction of duty by the Minister and his Department regarding responsibility for increasing turnout at elections. Many sections of the Government and Government Members agree that an electoral commission is needed to clean up the register and make voter registration easier. An electoral commission should take proactive measures to improve voter turnout and amalgamate oversight powers currently dispersed across SIPO and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The Bill introduces an amendment allowing candidates for the Seanad university panel the right to a free post for each household in their constituencies. It is, unfortunately, a sad indictment that this measure represents the sum total of the Minister’s ambitions for Seanad reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Taoiseach believed this matter was of such pivotal importance to the nation that he put the survival and the future of the Seanad before the people in a referendum. His response to the result of that referendum was to ensure any proposals for the reform of the Seanad are now at the back of his mind and that of the Government. He said at the time "sometimes in politics you get a wallop". It is obvious that the wallop in this case has put him into submission in terms of any proposals that might emanate from the Government on Seanad reform. It is a complete dereliction of responsibility. The sum total of the Government's response to the need for Seanad reform is this amending legislation, which merely gives certain candidates in Seanad elections the right to free post.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Many of the recommendations contained in the Manning report on the reform of the Seanad, which I mentioned earlier, could be put before the Dáil by the Government for immediate implementation. These proposals would empower the Seanad by giving all citizens a vote and broadening representation across specific minority groups. A fundamental overhaul of the political system is needed to tackle the big problems in Irish politics. That requires more than political stunts and power grabs. The referendum on the abolition of the Seanad was nothing more than a political stunt and an attempt to grab power. When that failed and the people rejected the referendum, no effort was made to take on board the wishes and feelings of the public. It was quite obvious to everybody concerned and all who took an interest in the referendum that the intention of the people was for the Seanad to be reformed. The voters were doing more than merely rejecting the Taoiseach's stunt. They wanted reform, but the Taoiseach has disregarded the public's views on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> It might have been appropriate for the Government, as it leaves office, to take this opportunity to start the sort of reform it promised when it assumed office. Unfortunately, that is not happening in this Bill. While we might recommend the provisions of this Bill, unfortunately there is very little contained in it. We had hoped that more of an effort would have been made in any Bill brought before the House to address the real reform that is required from an electoral amendment perspective. I see this as nothing more than a ticking exercise on the part of the Government. I repeat that I want to register my dissatisfaction and disappointment, and that of my party, with the Government's failure to take another opportunity to introduce real and meaningful electoral reform. Perhaps, despite its murmurings and its commitments to the public prior to entering office, that was never its intention. It might be the case that having entered office, and having failed to accept the will of the electorate as expressed in the Seanad referendum, the Government has decided to rub the people's noses in it again by introducing a Bill that does not provide for the sort of reform that is urgently required to address this situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_505">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Almost five years of promises of electoral reforms and new ways of doing things - we remember the "democratic revolution" - I am underwhelmed by the contents of the Bill, even if they are hard to argue with. A measure allowing people to post electoral items for free is almost the sum total of what is in this legislation. While I am happy to support it, this opportunity should have been used to address the need for Seanad reform. My party, like other parties, has made comprehensive proposals for the reform of the Seanad. The Constitutional Convention also pointed to the need for work to be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> This Bill proposes to give Freepost envelope facilities to Seanad candidates. This will differ from the new provision for Dáil candidates, who from now on will be allowed to send just one free post item to each household, rather than one such item to each registered individual. I can see no problem with making such provision. It is likely that a person who registered to vote in a Seanad election will be the only person living at his or her address who is entitled to vote in that election. I support the provision that will give the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, status as a nominating body in Seanad elections. I know this is an updating exercise. The third provision simply regularises the situation regarding applications to be placed on the supplementary register.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Earlier this year, I raised with the Minister the need to recognise the AILG and the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA. I note the presence in the Gallery of members of the AILG, which was formed following the amalgamation of the General Council of County Councils and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, two important bodies that did a great deal of work over the years. I would like the Government, in the short amount of time it has left, to give due recognition to LAMA and the AILG, in addition to identifying them as Seanad nominating bodies. Local government has to be taken out of the twilight zone. It must be given its place. In addition to deeming the AILG and LAMA to be nominating bodies for the Seanad, which is important in itself but is no more than a token exercise, the Government needs to treat those two important bodies properly as representatives of local government and local councils. I hope that will be done by this Government, in the remaining months of its term in office, and by those who occupy the Government benches in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> I would like to mention some issues relating to the overall reform of the Seanad. Since the defeat of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, a number of proposals have been made that would radically reform the way it operates at present. Unfortunately, the Government appears to have moved from wanting to get rid of the Seanad, in what had to be described as a "power grab", to being prepared to leave it exactly as it is. We wanted to completely reform it, but the Government wanted to banish it forever. Now it wants to make the minimum number of changes required. Our party would reform the Seanad by increasing the representation of women in the House and by broadening the franchise to provide for the representation of Irish citizens living in the northern Six Counties of our country and the Irish diaspora. I have heard a great deal of talk about how difficult it would be to organise that. I remind the House that people of all nationalities who are living in Ireland - from eastern Europe and from different parts of the world - can vote in those countries' elections by going to their embassies or using other means of voting. I am sure it is not beyond our wherewithal to organise a system that would allow the Irish diaspora to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> Fundamentally, we would like to see the second Chamber elected in direct elections involving all registered electors. This happens in other countries with some success, but it does not happen here. We nominally call this place a republic, but one cannot have a republic if one takes the word "public" out of the word "republic". The public comprises the people on the streets who put us in here to represent them. It should be the very same in the case of the Seanad, which is supposed to be the Upper House. It is farcical that we have something akin to a version of the British House of Lords. The Seanad may have started out with good intentions of representing various sectors and interests. I accept that it was devised with that intention by previous Governments and generations of politicians. We all know it has gone a long way from that, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> We would abolish the existing right of the Taoiseach to nominate 11 Members of the Seanad because it has to be the worst aspect of how each Seanad is constituted. It cannot be stood over. It is within the jurisdiction of the Government to change it. Even at this late stage, the Government could introduce an electoral Bill to abolish the gift that is handed to each Government to give it an automatic majority. Ireland must be one of the few countries in the world that gerrymanders the system in a way that ensures the party occupying the Government benches in the lower house of parliament has an automatic call on a given number of seats in the upper house, thereby guaranteeing it a majority in that house. I suggest that the current system poses a significant problem for the legitimacy of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> It has been proposed that the franchise should be broadened to include graduates of third level institutions other than those currently entitled to vote. That is fine and dandy, but we do not believe it goes far enough. There have also been proposals to include representatives of the broader community, including people involved in sport and the arts, representatives of emigrant groups, people from the North, disabled people and so on. That is all worthy and could be accommodated through a panel that would be elected through universal franchise. We would go that step further with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> In reality, while including those groups would make the Seanad more representative than it is at present, it would still only provide a token representation and do nothing to address the fundamentally undemocratic nature of Seanad Éireann as it is constituted. That is the key issue. The Government, in response to the rejection of the referendum proposal to abolish the Seanad, gave all third level graduates a vote in future Seanad elections. While that is welcome as a small improvement on the current situation, Sinn Féin cannot accept it as a meaningful attempt to reform the Seanad, nor is it a genuine attempt to address the Government's commitment in the wake of the rejection of the referendum to radically democratise the Seanad. I heard several Ministers in the aftermath of the referendum saying that big changes would be introduced and that the Government was committed to reforming the Upper House to make it more accountable and representative. That was all a puff of smoke; we have seen none of it. Another proposal considered by the committee set up by the Taoiseach after the referendum was to give voting rights to emigrants. That was approved in principle but it was claimed that nothing could be done to bring it into effect before the next election. What about the election after next? Will something be done before then?</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The only meaningful way to create a truly democratic, republican second Chamber would be to extend the vote to everyone entitled to vote in Dáil elections, citizens of Northern Ireland and the Irish living abroad. Unless we do that, we are simply engaging in window dressing. As it is currently constituted, the Seanad simply replicates the Dáil, the sitting Government and the Government's majority. It provides a means to reward political cronies and compensate failed general election candidates or would-be candidates. That is the reality of retaining the Government's nominees in the Seanad. That is the big black mark writ large across that Chamber. It is one of the fundamental elements which the Government has in its gift to change now.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The Sinn Féin delegates to the Constitutional Convention called on the Government and the Oireachtas to empower a second Constitutional Convention with a broader mandate to consider issues related to the strengthening of constitutional protection of human rights and outstanding political and institutional reforms, including reform of the Seanad. We believe that rather than the current Government, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or any other party or, indeed, a Government appointed committee coming up with proposals to tinker around with the Seanad as it is currently constituted, the issue should be passed over to the Constitutional Convention to deliberate on and to come up with genuinely democratic proposals and solutions. We have heard much praise for the Constitutional Convention in this House. That body should be reconvened and we should trust it to do this job.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> While there is nothing to prevent any political grouping from submitting ideas and having them debated here, we believe that a broader discussion involving societal and community representation is required. The Taoiseach, despite his contention during the referendum campaign that the Seanad is elitist and requires radical reform, has blocked any suggestion whatsoever of the Constitutional Convention being reconvened to consider this matter. The convention published its report last year and one of its key proposals was that it be reconvened to consider Seanad reform. However, the Taoiseach rejected that proposal. Despite the Taoiseach's description of the Seanad as elitist, nothing has been done by this Government to alter that reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The only post-referendum reform introduced to date is the extension of the franchise to a relatively small section of the electorate through the university panel. That is minor reform. While any extension of the franchise is welcome, it is farcical to have a second Chamber that does not have the legitimacy of its members being elected through universal franchise. It is a pity that this legislation does not address at least some of those core issues. I understand that time does not allow us to do everything at once but the situation with regard to the Taoiseach's 11 nominees is within the gift of the Government to change now. That could be done very quickly. The 11 nominees' seats could be filled from two new panels. The Government could create new panels, one for voters in the North and the diaspora and one for some disadvantaged group in society such as the disabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> There are several other issues relating to the electoral process which must be addressed. There are continuing problems with the electoral register and Sinn Féin has put forward proposals in this regard. There is also a proposal to establish an electoral commission because we need a single body to deal with the organisation and oversight of elections. The Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht has been considering this issue for several months. I and others on that committee as well as other sectoral groups and interested individuals have submitted proposals to the consultation process. This led to a document on which there is considerable agreement across all parties. However, the process is unlikely to be completed in time for legislation to be drafted, debated and passed in order that such a commission could be in place prior to the next general election. That means that the very reasonable and practical proposals relating to voter registration and other issues will not be implemented and that problems with the electoral register will continue into next year, which is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> While supporting this Bill, I would point out that we also need legislation to change Seanad Éireann radically which was promised in the aftermath of the referendum by those on the Government benches. That said, many Labour Party Deputies were very quiet on the issue. The Government's position was quite mixed really. While I recognise that we cannot do it all in a short period, by the time of the next election the Government will have had almost two years to institute some meaningful reforms that would give the Seanad more legitimacy, make it more republican, fairer and remove some of the elitism inherent in it, about which the Taoiseach spoke so eloquently. Had the Government introduced some meaningful reforms, it could have removed a sizeable element of the elitist nature of our second Chamber. The Government should have taken one or two sizeable steps rather than the very small tiptoe it took.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation, the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015. I warmly welcome the Bill and the debate on it which gives us an opportunity to speak about elections, electoral politics, the Seanad and related matters. We must reform the democratic system and introduce the new and radical changes which were promised in 2011 following the banking crisis and the economic crash. We must be open to change and put our citizens at the centre of this change. If we do not do that, all the talk of reform is just hot air.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Today, once again we witnessed more sad and tragic funerals of members of the Traveller community who were killed in the horrific fire in Carrickmines. Our hearts go out to the victims' families and I express my sincere sympathy to them. However, we need more than sympathy for Travellers in society. The Traveller community needs respect, equality and decent services. For too long they have been ignored and discriminated against and this must change. Travellers in this country are our Palestinians. They have been ignored and neglected for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is criminal that funding for Traveller housing and accommodation has not been drawn down. All politicians must be brave and stand up for Traveller rights. I raise this issue in the context of the Bill and the urgent need for a new brand of politics. Regardless of political differences, prejudice, racism and failure to show respect for the human person should never be tolerated in any political system or democratic society. </p>
          <p eId="para_522"> The purpose of the Bill is to make three distinct amendments to electoral law. First, amendments are proposed to the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937 concerning the free post entitlements for Seanad candidates. Second, the Bill amends the Seanad Electoral (Panel) Act 1947 to provide that the Association of Irish Local Government assumes the entitlement to be a nominating body of its predecessors. Third, the Bill makes amendments as to who can apply to the supplementary register, as outlined in the Electoral Act 1992. These are the three components of the legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_523"> It is important to discuss the Seanad and parliamentary democracy. Sadly, certain sections of society wanted to close down the Seanad a couple of years ago. I was one of those who campaigned to keep the Upper House open, while making it more democratic and inclusive. We won the debate against the odds and in the face of a great deal of populist nonsense. We were promised necessary new reforms at the time. I support extending the Seanad franchise to emigrants and the diaspora. The Seanad also needs voices from the North, because we must be vigilant with regard to the peace process. We need to build on the Good Friday Agreement rather than trying to pull it down. </p>
          <p eId="para_524"> I want the Seanad to be more inclusive and respectful of democratic values. The issues of cronyism and elitism must be challenged and wiped out. I am strongly in favour of major reform of the process by which the Taoiseach nominates 11 persons to the Seanad. Members of the Traveller community could have done with a voice in the Seanad in the past three weeks. I would welcome any decision to have a voice in the Seanad speaking on behalf of Travellers because many of those who spoke out on the issue were ignored by certain sections of the media. </p>
          <p eId="para_525"> I am equally in favour of ensuring that people with disabilities have a voice in the Upper House. Every day, we meet quality people with great ideas about politics, the rights of persons with disabilities and the United Nations Convention on Human Rights. They are people with brilliant minds, yet their physical disability appears to be a major problem. I ask members of the Government to open their minds and hearts to the quality people with disabilities in broader society who could make a contribution and change the political agenda in the Oireachtas. I raise these ideas in the context of the broader debate on electoral reform. As we approach the 1916 commemorations, it is important to ask ourselves whether we have implemented the democratic programme and vision set out in the Proclamation. Modern Ireland needs a vision of equality and respect. We must look after the weaker sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> We must also focus on supporting and developing many of the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending a meeting of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association with the Ceann Comhairle. It was pointed out at the meeting that the Speaker of the Stormont Assembly, Mitchel McLaughlin, and the Ceann Comhairle have a strong relationship and have worked together to build trust between Unionists and Nationalists and the North and South in recent years. One does not hear much about that, even in this Chamber. We need to highlight the good work being done among all strands of political opinion on this island. I raise this issue in the context of this discussion on elections, politics and electoral reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_527"> To return to the implications of the Bill, if this legislation is enacted, candidates in Seanad university elections will continue to be entitled to send material in respect of their candidature by free post to each voter on the relevant electoral register. The requirement that material be sent to households only, which is to be commenced for general elections, will not be applied to the Seanad university elections. The delivery of communications to households rather than individuals is intended as a cost-saving measure, as has been pointed out. This is part of the broader brief. </p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Many youth groups have raised wider issues regarding elections. For example, the National Youth Council of Ireland has highlighted registration barriers and linked these to the high number of younger voters who are not registered. It has called for a centralised system of online voter registration. While it is currently possible to check whether one is registered, it is not possible to register online. I raise this issue because many young people believe they are not being shown enough respect to persuade them to get involved in politics. We need young, fresh voices to enter the political system. The turnout among young people in the recent referendum on marriage equality was substantial. However, we need young people to turn out on issues of poverty and the rights of people with disabilities. They must step up to the plate and show support for tough political issues such as the rights of Travellers. We must not run away from difficult issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">I join the Ceann Comhairle in welcoming our guests and I hope they enjoy their stay. It is interesting that they arrived in the middle of a debate on an important electoral Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> As I stated, it is important to get more young people involved in the political system. We need to encourage the many new faces and voices in broader society to become more involved in politics and make them more inclusive. </p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Section 3 substitutes section 15(1A) of the Electoral Act 1992. The new section includes a new provision that a person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register of electors if he or she was not a citizen of Ireland on the qualifying date - 1 September each year - for a register of electors and subsequently became a citizen of Ireland. This is an important measure. </p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I welcome the legislation. We have much more to do to reform and bring fresh ideas into the political system. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with an opportunity to speak on the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_535">I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on the issue of electoral amendment. However, I am surprised that the three changes proposed are so minimal in the context of what needs to be done to make the electoral system more representative and democratic. The Bill deals with three matters in respect of the upcoming Dáil and Seanad general elections. A minor change is proposed in respect of the nominating body for the Seanad. A minor change is also proposed on free postage for candidates for university constituencies in the Seanad elections. Reform of the supplementary register for the Dáil is the third proposal. The main issue with the Bill is what is not in it but could be given the significant issues discussed in the environment committee on an electoral commission. Over the course of many meetings, a number of issues were brought up at the committee which require serious reform if we are to have the maximum number of people voting.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I voted to abolish the Seanad but the Government failed in its mission to have it abolished. It is not democratic and the massive cost to the State to represent the 16% of the population who have a university degree is outrageous. Graduates of DIT and other third level institutions are not even represented. There is a hierarchy and a discrimination there. It is farcical that there will be a by-election for the Seanad in a few weeks in which only Oireachtas Members will have a vote. Every office will unnecessarily receive registered envelopes for that at a cost of €2,000 to €3,000. We could easily have a different voting system for those who want to vote. Notwithstanding all of the issues that came up during the Seanad referendum campaign, there has been no broadening of the electorate. There are a couple of minor tweaks in relation to free postage and nominating bodies. It will annoy immensely those people who gave their position on it and wanted the Seanad reformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Regarding the supplementary register and Dáil elections, only two categories of persons can go on the supplementary register. They are those who have turned 18 since 15 February and new residents in an area. New citizens are not allowed to update their citizenship status as matters stand. I represent a constituency in which one in four people was born outside Ireland. It is at least twice the national average. Nationally, in any event, at least 500,000 people in the State were not born in Ireland. Many of them are excluded from having a vote. In the case of Dublin West and other parts of the country which had an influx of migration during the economic boom, there is a host of people living and working here, some for 15 years, who have no say in who is in their national Parliament. They are completely disenfranchised unless they become Irish citizens, which costs €1,000. Even if they do, they have only climbed one hurdle. I am amazed to discover on a daily basis that many of the people in my area who have become Irish citizens have not had their vote upgraded to vote in Dáil elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> The Department of Justice and Equality is organising fantastic naturalisation ceremonies, some of which I have attended with people I know, but it does not have someone present to register people for Dáil elections. People walk away from the ceremony thinking they are Irish citizens with the right to vote, but they do not have the right unless they go and upgrade their vote themselves. Most of them are oblivious of having to do that. I cannot understand how so much is being put in by the State to speed up the naturalisation process, which I welcome, yet it does not inform people about this there and then and have someone present. I was at a citizenship ceremony recently at which the Garda band was playing music. All that was needed was a garda there to register people. I do not understand how that is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> This issue is hitting large swathes of people in Dublin West, the constituency with which I am most familiar. In one area of the constituency, 51% of people there are not Irish. When one walks around that area with the electoral register, one finds that hardly anyone is on it notwithstanding the fact that many of those people are Irish citizens. I deplore the fact that local authorities are making no effort to mass register people in the way that is required. We need a proactive campaign to register all kinds of people, not just new citizens. Councils should be engaging with immigrant and community groups to promote registration and make it easier. I am beginning to ask if the Government is happy that people are not registering to vote in the numbers that are needed. We know that is the case in urban areas and working class communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> There should be a push by the Department of Justice and Equality when it is naturalising people to inform them of the registration issue at the ceremony itself. We need an electoral commission that will consistently apply the law. It could have a remit on central information to be used to update citizenship status. Everyone who has lived and worked in the country for more than four years should be entitled to have a vote on what goes on in the country. One should not have to be a citizen to vote. It is not a requirement in other countries that one must change one's citizenship in order to get a vote. If one is paying tax and living here and wants to vote, one should have a right to vote. In many cases, people are married. We had an ironic situation in the marriage equality referendum. I know EU citizens who do not have a right to vote in Dáil general elections but who have lived and worked here for years and are in relationships and have families. They were campaigning for a "Yes" vote but they did not have the vote themselves. We should change and look at that in the electoral commission. I hope that will be considered seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> My office is currently writing to hundreds of constituents to update their registration details, but I see nothing being done by the local authorities in areas with new, broad, heterogenous, multi-ethnic populations to have a register that is reflective of the local population. I wonder why. Obviously, resources are an issue. Our local authority is being resourced to do that. There are communities in which mass registration could be done. Many of us attended the briefings by the USI recently. It pointed out that in the marriage equality referendum, it mass registered tens of thousands of students to vote for the first time. That was a very positive development. If the USI can be facilitated to do that, what efforts is the Minister of State and her Department making to ensure this happens in other areas not just among students, but among working class communities, migrant communities and so on? It is shameful that we have taken in people and society has changed, but we do not seem to be concerned that they have a right to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> I am extremely disappointed that three technical measures are being proposed in the Dáil and taking up hours of time when much more serious reforms could have been introduced on the electoral register and voting which would have encouraged people to vote. Many people are going to be very disappointed to find that they are disenfranchised when they roll up to vote, hopefully against the Government, in February.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I refer to the provision for local voters who become naturalised. Deputy Coppinger just raised the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">My constituency, or at least part of it, has a similar profile. Recently, I made inquiries with my local authority about this matter. Consequently, I tabled a parliamentary question this week because I wanted to find out the Department's position. Although the council had a process, it was very much its own and <i>ad hoc</i>. When I rang the council, I was told that if people appeared with their passports, photocopies would be taken at reception and passed to the office that updated the council's electoral register. Something that came to light was that people could fall through the cracks. For example, a Dublin council is updating people's records on the draft register, which is to be published next February. Were an election called in the meantime, though, where would those people stand? They would need to be included in the supplementary register. If we move from the local authorities' relatively <i>ad hoc</i> procedure to the more formal one that is outlined in the Bill, I am concerned that some people will fall through the cracks when the information collected is not followed through on. People might believe that they have registered, but because they did not do so under the new procedure, that might not actually be the case. The Department needs to be mindful of this issue and liaise with local authorities so as to ensure that whatever they have been doing joins up with the new procedure. It is an urgent issue, as there could have been an election in November according to newspaper reports, although it does not look like that now. It is important that this matter be advertised and made known publicly. For example, where does someone who has already provided a passport to a local authority stand?</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The story should be clear and there should be an advertising campaign using, for example, media organs like the old <i>Metro Herald</i>, the <i>Evening Herald</i> and local and national newspapers as well as online fora. In the lead up to the election, will the Department consider a campaign to educate voters? I mean this in a general sense. We have a sophisticated electorate but PR-STV, which I support as the best electoral system, is complex. Some voters whom I have encountered have lived in Ireland for all of their lives yet still ask me why I am not on local election ballot papers, what happens if they vote beyond No. 1 and so on. Some members of the general population do not fully understand how the system works.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> There is a particular issue with people from other countries. I noticed something about a large number of ballot papers at a local election. It just so happened that they would have been for the Labour Party had they been valid, which is why I noticed them. It seems that people who wanted to vote for Labour where we had, for example, two candidates only put a tick beside each candidate's name. Their votes were spoiled. I do not know for sure, but I figure that some of those voters were newcomers to Ireland, were used to their own countries' systems and were not familiar with ours. I am sure that other political parties and independent candidates were also affected. As we have so many new voters, we need voter education. Television adverts informing people on voting methods are common in, for example, Pakistan. Going online and using YouTube or so on would be cheaper, but there should be as much voter education as possible and the Department should consider what other countries have done. Voter education campaigns should also take into accounts literacy issues stemming from language difficulties and poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> While I commend the work of local groups that have provided voter education, I would not leave it just to them. Unfortunately, there can be a political bias. As politicians, we will educate people as best we can, but it would be good to have an independent body. Ideally, an electoral commission would organise this work. In the interim, though, the Department should consider doing it. If money is an issue, there are many ways to educate voters cheaply, for example, via local and social media, YouTube and so on. The communities in question should be targeted. People from different countries have varying levels of understanding where our voting system is concerned. Those who have been in Ireland for longer have grown used to our system.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> This is an important issue and I hope that the Minister of State, the Department and the official who is present with the Minister of State today and is experienced in this regard, having been the national Returning Officer at elections, take my comments on board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_549">Tá áthas orm bheith in ann labhairt ar an mBille seo. It is amazing how time flies. The Minister of State has been nearly five years in government, yet there has been virtually no electoral reform. Even the small matters have been overlooked. After the last election, there was a general consensus that the establishment of an electoral commission would be a good idea. I happened to be the environment Minister at that election, but my only involvement in it beyond signing the order was trying to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible were given jobs at polling stations, which is an initiative that we should continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> The idea of an electoral commission that is not only independent but is seen to be independent in the operation of elections is a good one. It should have general oversight to ensure uniform implementation across the country. Approaches to polling stations often vary. Our use of community halls or schools should be uniform throughout the country. We must also ensure that every building used is accessible and has all necessary facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> There has been a great deal of discussion of the Seanad, and rightly so, because all that we are getting is a provision on envelopes. Sometimes, we wait for so long to tackle the big reforms that we end up making none. There has been no reason in the past four and a half years not at least to open the university franchise to graduates of all universities in the State. It is farcical that we are still tied to the NUI-TCD model.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Many people who are critical of the Seanad actually do not know why there are university seats in that House at all. The reason, of course, is that up to 1937, including under British law and, amazingly, under the Free State Constitution, there were university seats in the House of Commons and then in the Dáil. Quite rightly, when the new Constitution was being introduced in 1937, it was decided to abolish university seats in Dáil Éireann and make it a House of popular franchise such that every Member would be elected directly by the people. One might ask why university seats were not simply abolished. The argument against that at the time was quite valid. I believe there were two seats in the Dáil for the National University of Ireland and two for Trinity College at the time. In those days, the majority of graduates of Trinity College belonged to the Unionist minority. It was felt that, by transferring those seats into the Seanad and increasing the representation to three, it would ensure the minority voice would be heard in Leinster House. The Protestant Unionist population tended to be so scattered around the Twenty-six Counties at the time that it would not have been able to ensure election in any one constituency. That was then and this is now and circumstances have changed dramatically, but it is important for people to understand that the historical reason for the arrangement was very valid. It is time, or thar a bheith in am, that we changed the law. That could have happened quite simply here.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The second point that is interesting about this is that the State recognised what I would call dispersed minorities. I refer to a community within a community that is so dispersed that it cannot, in any democratic election, elect its own representatives. We seem to have lost that concept. It is one that could be revived in the context of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> There has been considerable disquiet among all fair-minded people in the past two weeks over the horrendous deaths in the fires in Carrickmines. Those of us who work continuously with the Traveller community have had first-hand experience of how it is discriminated against. From interviews in a very detailed work produced by the eminent sociologist Dr. Mícheál Mac Gréil over 30 or 35 years, the most recent version of which was launched in the past few years, it was found that 18% of the people of this State believe Travellers should not be given Irish citizenship. Travellers are people of this soil and of this land. They comprise the most disliked group in our society, not because of anything they do but because of who they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> One very dramatic and positive step that could be taken on Committee Stage would be the introduction of an amendment to ensure Traveller representation in Seanad Éireann. We often hear about emigrant representation. That is a little more tricky for a number of logistical reasons but the proposal on Travellers would be quite simple. Alternatively, one could even introduce an amendment that would make Traveller groups, such as Pavee Point, nominating bodies for the Seanad. That would be even easier on Committee Stage. It would ensure Traveller representation in the Oireachtas. This would begin to change perceptions of the Traveller community.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Let me outline an interesting point in Fr. Mac Gréil's study, which considered every kind of group, both national and non-national. The study found that the main in-group in Irish society comprises Irish language speakers. One might ask why not, but one should think about the status of Irish language speakers in 1890, for example. They were part of a small, peripheral, poor community on the west coast comprising small farmers and fishermen, who are not normally considered the greatest in-group in society. One should consider how social engineering over a hundred years, perhaps not for the purpose of bringing the group in but to promote the Irish language, had the interesting sociological effect of bringing the group in from the margin such that, when measured against all comers, it became the main in-group in Irish society. Therefore, there is a way of bringing about change by creating status. It is time that we created status for Travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I hope the Minister of State will do the job I propose but if she does not, we will do it. On 7 May 2014, I published the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014. Bhí cúis an-simplí leis an mBille sin. Is é sin, i láthair na huaire, faoi na dlithe toghcháin, is féidir toghchán a reachtáil ar na hoileáin amach ón gcósta i dTír Chonaill, Maigh Eo, Gaillimh agus Corcaigh lá nó dhó roimh lá an olltoghcháin, toghchán uachtaránachta nó reifreann agus mar sin de. An chéad toradh a bhíonn ar sin ná nach mbíonn an díospóireacht thart nuair a chaitheas na hoileánaigh vótáil, más sin a shocraíonn an ceann comhairimh. Mar shampla, anois is féidir leis na meáin a bheith ag plé leis an toghchán go meán lae lá roimh an toghchán, ach i gcásanna, bíonn an toghchán thart do na hoileánaigh dhá lá roimh ré. Freisin, i láthair na huaire sa dlí, fágtar é seo faoin gceann comhairimh i ngach dáilcheantar.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> An dara rud ná go hiondúil bíonn toghchán ar an Aoine. An fáth go mbíonn sé ar siúl ar an Aoine ná gur féidir le daoine ón tuath filleadh abhaile don toghchán tráthnóna Dé hAoine agus vótáil. Ní gá dóibh lá saoire a thógáil ón obair le vótáil. Má bhíonn an toghchán ar na hoileáin lá nó dhó roimh ré, bíonn orthu lá saoire nó go deimhin dhá lá saoire a thógáil, ceann le dul isteach agus ceann le dul amach, le gur féidir leo vótáil. Bhí an fhoráil seo ann ar chúis mhaith blianta ó shin, nuair nach raibh rochtain éasca chuig na hoileáin. Ach níl oileán ar bith anois amach ón gcósta nach bhfuil seirbhís báid laethúil ann agus is corruair ariamh go dteipeann ar an mbád teacht isteach. An cineál stoirme a theastódh le nach bhféadfaidís seoladh, is ar éigean go bhféadfaí feidhmiú ar an mórthír ach oiread. Ar ndóigh, sa chás go dtarlódh an rud uair sa 1,000 nó sa 10,000, is go raibh stoirm ollmhór ann, táimid in ann an jab a dhéanamh le héileacaptar. Murar féidir le bád ná héileacaptar seoladh, ní bheadh muid in ann daoine a thabhairt isteach ar an mórthír ach oiread.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Tá an rud a tharlaíonn i gCorcaigh spéisiúil. I gCorcaigh le blianta fada bhí an toghchán ar na hoileáin ar an lá céanna leis an mórthír agus ní raibh aon fhadhb leis sin, agus tá Oileán Chléire chomh fada amach sa bhfarraige le haon oileán eile. Más féidir seo a dhéanamh i gCorcaigh, cén fáth nach féidir é a dhéanamh i nGaillimh, áit nach bhfuil i gceist ach ceithre oileán, na hOiléain Árainn - tá go leor cainte déanta faoi rochtain chucu sin le gairid - agus Inis Bó Finne? Níl ach ceithre oileán freisin i gceist i gContae Mhaigh Eo, Inis Bigil agus trí oileán eile, agus sílim go mbíonn vótáil ar cheithre nó cúig oileán i gContae Thír Chonaill, Gabhla, Inis Fraoigh, Árainn Mhór agus Oileán Thoraí.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Go deimhin, ar na hoileáin bheaga, ceadaítear lá gairid vótála. Ar Inis Fraoigh agus Gabhla, ní bhíonn ann ach ceithre nó cúig huaire a chloig le vótáil ar lá na vótála. Mar sin, beidh muid ag cur síos leasuithe ar Chéim an Choiste le leasadh a dhéanamh leis an ndiscréid a bhaint de na cinn comhairimh sa cheist seo, le go gcaithfidh an toghchán a bheith ar an lá céanna leis an gcuid eile den tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> As I have said in Irish, we will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage of this Bill to have the islands and mainland vote on the same day.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Early-day voting is a relic of the past which, thankfully, is now gone. I believe I played my part in terms of providing reliable ferry services on piers and islands to ensure that it is a thing of the past. The argument made was that the ballot boxes might not be got in on time for the count, but that is a redundant argument. If the Minister checked the number of days the ferries do not sail from the islands at the appointed times, she would find they were few and far between. It would take a hell of a storm to stop them. If that extreme case were to happen, we always have the fall-back of the helicopter services available around the coast that can travel in every kind of weather. In fact, we have often argued that it is quicker to get a patient in from the island than it would be from certain more rural parts of my constituency and, therefore, the argument for previous-day voting is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> One might ask why this is such a big issue. The reason we now hold elections commonly on a Friday is to allow people from the country who are working or studying away to get home and vote, and not to force them to get involved in postal votes, which people inevitably forget to do. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, but we must remember there is an even bigger proportion of the island population that have to go the mainland to work or study. They commonly go home every weekend, but having the voting on a Wednesday or a Thursday means they have to take a day or a day and a half off work to go home, vote and then come back again, whereas if voting was on a Friday they could go out to the islands. As I said, the logistics of bringing the boxes back are not huge. It is really simple, because there are fantastic boat and ferry services now to all the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> We propose that the provision allowing the returning officers to choose an early date be deleted. If the Minister wants a practical example as to whether that will cause great commotion in the country, I would put this point to her. For years now, the Cork islands have had same-day voting. Most of Cork's islands are inshore, with one exception - Cape Clear, which is as far out to sea, when one considers the boat quality they would have, as any of the other islands one might argue about, namely, Clare Island, Inishturk, Inisbofin, the three Aran Islands, and Tory Island, because Aranmore, Gola and Inishfree are near the coast. As the Minister knows, Aran is already blessed with both an air service - long may it last - and a boat service. It is fantastic in this day and age that those living on the Aran Islands, which have on them half of the voting population, have to vote a day earlier than everybody else. They also complain bitterly that they miss out on the last days of the campaign. They have voted by the time the campaign winds up. Whether it is we or the Minister who put down the amendments, I hope that this relic of times gone by - and it was a legitimate relic, although the original reason for it was the Seanad - will go. It is very important in politics that we do not continue to do things just because there was a valid reason in the past. </p>
          <p eId="para_565"> That reminds me of a story I was told by a Secretary General when I was a Minister in which he illustrated this point about things continuing to happen in the system long after the good reason for doing them had disappeared. He told me that when the group of people called Fianna Fáil came into power in 1932, they found out that a copy of every Cabinet memo was sent to Whitehall. Being very strong Republicans, they ordered that no more memos were to be sent to Whitehall. Civil servants were always very obedient and, apparently, the civil servants said, "We had better do what the Government has told us to do. No memo is to go to Whitehall. But this crowd won't last any time whatsoever - they are only a temporary measure - so we will put each memo aside, and when they are gone out of office, we will send them all over to Whitehall." That was in 1932. The Minister knows what happened. Fianna Fáil won the elections in 1933, 1937, 1938, 1943 and 1944, all in a row, and they were still in power right up to 1948. Some time in the late 1940s, a junior civil servant who had never known anything about this asked why they always put one extra memo aside. Whoever they asked said they did not know but would find out. After a while, they came back and said that the reason the memos were being put aside was that they were eventually to be sent to Whitehall. In the meantime, there was a new Constitution, and the question of Whitehall being involved in our affairs was long gone, but they were still putting the memo aside. This island voting issue is in the same realm, and the Minister will be given 100 reasons not to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The Minister of State has responsibility for rural development. She knows the attitudes that pervade. Where it seems so difficult to provide rural or island communities with simple things, this would be a nice legacy. I know she has not been in that position for the four years, but this would be a nice legacy for her to leave behind - to put this one right. It would make her colleagues a lot more popular on the islands if she grabbed the bull by the horns and said that, technologically, there is no problem now getting the ballot papers in. It is just not an issue. Let us get on with it and give them the same franchise as the people on the mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> We must not forget that more islanders have to live off-island during the week for work or for fishing. So many of them are out fishing all week, and they come back on a Friday evening to their families. It is very interesting because every time I look at the island boxes I see that the turnout is low. That is not because they are not interested in politics; they surely are interested. It is because it is a huge sacrifice for them, that they should not be asked to make, to get to vote, particularly at busy times of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">-----but I will certainly consider the debate and see what happens at the end of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> I want to respond to some of the issues raised. All of the Deputies supported the measures in the Bill. The Bill deals with three specific issues that will bring about real and meaningful change. The Bill adapts electoral law to changing circumstances. Its purpose is to modernise electoral law to meet the changing circumstances we see in Ireland. I believe that was the thrust of Deputy Ó Cuív's contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> Significant savings can be realised in the cost of running the next general election with the change in the Freepost arrangements for Dáil elections. Deputy Coppinger said they were meagre savings. I am not sure what world Deputy Coppinger lives in, but in my world a saving of €3.6 million is significant. I take this opportunity to advise Deputies that it is also the Minister's intention to commence the household distribution provision for presidential elections. That, too, will have a potential saving.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Our new citizens who meet the age and residency requirements will be entitled to apply for entry in the supplementary register for all elections and referendums once they acquire Irish citizenship.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The amendment on the format of the ballot paper for use in Dáil elections that the Minister will bring forward on Committee Stage should help voters to avoid misplacing voting preferences. It should also be more user-friendly for voters with visual and literacy difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Numerous points were raised on the electoral commission. In his remarks on electoral administration, Deputy Cowen neglected to refer to the consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission. This was published in January by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly. The joint Oireachtas committee of which the Deputy is a member has done good work this year in engaging with a wide range of interested parties on the paper. The Minister now awaits the report and the recommendations of the committee. This will further inform the development of the electoral commission Bill. Contrary to what Deputy Cowen suggested, this Government has a proud record of electoral reform. We have overseen significant enhancement of our political funding regulatory system, effective banning of corporate donations, the reduction of donation limits, as well as greater transparency, including through the publication of party accounts. I hope the candidate gender balance provisions will change the face of the next Dáil, but that is a matter for the electorate. In any event, at least we will now be giving the electorate a choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Deputy Stanley spoke at length on Seanad reform. That is a matter for another day or, perhaps, many other days. However, it is important that we debate the issue further.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> Deputies referred to the electoral register. I doubt if there has ever been a discussion in this House on electoral matters in which difficulties relating to the electoral register were not raised. People who have come up through the local authority system know that this is a constant source of angst between the executive and elected members. As we move into the future, technology is going begin to play a major role in ensuring that the way to register to vote will be far simpler.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Deputy Ó Cuív has campaigned for many years on voting on the islands. I would encourage him to bring forward his amendment. Let us see where that amendment will take us.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Deputy Tuffy remarked on new citizen registration. When the Bill is passed the Department will be engaging with the local authorities, the Department of Justice and Equality and other bodies representing our new citizens in respect of new provisions to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from the change in this law.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> I believe I have addressed most of the issues. I thank the Deputies for their interesting contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">Yes. I thank the Minister of State for being present. The Bill, as proposed, is one of many steps that the Government has taken with regard to addressing the issue of burglaries of dwellings, as well as the general investment in our criminal justice system and An Garda Síochána. These moves are essential in light of the closure of the Garda Síochána College in Templemore in 2009. Clearly, we have a requirement to bolster and improve the technology, equipment and facilities available to An Garda Síochána in order that it can tackle crime head on. This is particularly relevant regarding the burglary of dwellings, which has become a major problem throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I wish to refer to some independent research carried out by the University of Michigan on Irish rural communities between 2011 and 2014. This was reported on in <i>The Irish Times</i> by John McManus. The report made interesting reading, as did the research findings. One finding is that crime in rural communities is not driven by the fact that Garda stations are closed, nor is it driven by the fact that Garda numbers have been reduced. Previously, the strength of the force stood at upward of 14,000. In fact, the research indicates that crime is being driven by our economic position and joblessness. Clearly, the Government has embarked on a two-pronged attack in that area, not only by increasing the number of gardaí available on the beat - there were as many as 61,000 hours last year alone as a result of the closure of part-time stations throughout the country - but also through facilitating the creation of 130,000 jobs since March 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> The Bill addresses issues relating to bail and sentencing for prolific burglars. Instances of crime, including burglary of dwellings, farms and places of work have been numerous in recent years. This measure being introduced by the Government is an essential component to tackle that problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> I held a number of public meetings in my constituency right through the summer months. Genuine concern was expressed and the question of the steps we are taking to address these issues was raised. I am pleased the Government has been able to address issue of Garda numbers and also that relating to the number of squad cars available for deployment. Over 600 cars have now been deployed. I understand this is a net increase of over 200. In addition, the purchase of 260 new Garda high-speed or interception vehicles was announced earlier this week and these will be deployed on our roads before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> There is considerable fear of burglary. People are going to extraordinary lengths to secure their homes and farms. This is something the Government must address. We pick up the newspapers on a daily basis and read of an individual who has been before the courts with 50 or 100 instances on his or her rap sheet, including burglaries and other offences against individuals and property. Some of these people receive short sentences. Worse, they are being released on bail only to reoffend and so the cycle continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> This Bill will tackle these problems by imprisoning such individuals for consecutive as opposed to concurrent terms. This is positive step on the part of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Section 1 will ensure in appropriate cases that prolific burglars can be refused bail outright in such cases as an adult who is charged with a relevant offence alleged to have been committed in a dwelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">A relevant offence is defined as being a burglary or aggravated burglary contrary to section 12 or 13, respectively, of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud and Offences) Act 2001. In these cases the court must consider previous convictions, coupled with pending charges or recent convictions, as evidence that the accused is likely to commit further domestic burglaries. That is an essential component of a proper functioning criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I wish to address another issue raised, namely, the requirement of the State to invest in the Prison Service. It is all well and good to bring about legislation such as the Bill before the House and have An Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system implement it, but is very clear that as part of the process, we must also provide for increased numbers of prison cells and modernisation of some prisons. On the "Today with Sean O'Rourke" or "The Pat Kenny Show" radio programmes today, a topic of discussion was whether there is a case to be made regarding a concern that the Judiciary is conscious of the number of prison cells available at any given time when deciding on a sentence. I am sure the Judiciary is independent in its thinking, but the fact that such a concern exists in the public domain and was discussed on a national radio show shows it is something of which the Government and House must be cognisant in terms of providing supports for the Judiciary to ensure it can carry out its duties as effectively as we would like. That includes the concerns about bail laws and the release of individuals who are guilty of prolific crimes, their reoffending and perhaps going before the courts again having not been properly dissuaded - I do not like to use the term "punished" - from carrying out further criminal activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> As I mentioned, I welcome the introduction of consecutive sentences for prolific burglars. The implementation of such sentences will assist in keeping them off the streets in our local communities and will give greater peace of mind to individuals in their homes. It will also act as a deterrent to burglars once the Bill is enacted. Section 2 will insert a new section 54A, into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. This will require the imposition of consecutive sentences where a court has decided to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglaries committed within a 12-month window. I ask that the Department of Justice and Equality review the implementation of the Bill after 12 months of it being enacted in order that we can assess whether a 12-month window for a repeat offender to be caught is an effective way of dealing with such criminals. That should happen on an ongoing basis with all Bills passed by the House and would be a worthwhile endeavour for the Department to engage in.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Section 2 applies to relevant offences, meaning it only applies to domestic burglaries or aggravated burglaries where the charged person is an adult convicted of domestic burglary in the five years prior to the burglary offence for which he or she has been sentenced. Section 54A(2) provides that where a previous burglary offence on the part of a person being sentenced would be determined to be within the remit of section 54A(1)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), that offence can only be considered for the purposes of satisfying either paragraph (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) and cannot be used to satisfy both. That is related to my point on ensuring there is an effective review of the implementation of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> As I said at the outset, it is all well and good for us to pass legislation such as this Bill, which I would describe as a groundbreaking. It has been a groundbreaking day. Within the past hour, the Seanad passed the Marriage Bill, which is an extraordinary watershed for our society. Bills like the one before this House will help those who have been subjected to horrific crimes, some of which we saw reported in recent months, and for which crimes individuals have been given quite lengthy sentences. Once the Bill is enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President, we will ensure proper deterrents are in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_597"> It is a step towards ensuring we dissuade criminals from reoffending. A suite of measures and investment are required. I very much welcome the Bill and I am sure the Minister for Justice and Equality will be only too happy to invest more money in the Department and Prison Service. This is the first step in moving towards that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichelleMulherin" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_598">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this important and timely Bill. Its particular significance is that it speaks to the reality of what is happening regarding burglaries. It examines repeat offending, sentencing and so on. Burglary is a heinous crime which invades people's private property and personal space. We know in the case of aggravated burglary that it can cause harm to individuals, homes, families and so on. It is very traumatic and we have to deal with it in a serious fashion. This Bill, among a suite of measures undertaken by the Minister and An Garda Síochána, goes some way towards tackling serious crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Repeat offenders are granted bail despite having been charged with multiple burglaries, and they often commit further burglaries while out on bail. I guess they feel they have nothing to lose. Another problem is that when they have been convicted having been charged with multiple burglaries, all the offences are taken into account and one sentence is imposed. There is concurrent sentencing, as Deputy Farrell has described. A person might as well do a dozen burglaries as he or she will be treated the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> We know that at the moment the hands of the courts are tied on the issue of bail. Where charges are pending and a person applies for bail, the fact he or she has previous convictions for domestic burglary is not taken into account in the decision of judges on whether to grant bail on the basis of whether the person is likely to commit further burglaries. It seems to be a habit for those engaged in burglaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The figures provided by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, show that 75% of burglaries are carried out by 25% of burglars. I would call them career burglars and they need to be dealt with in that fashion. Parts of the Bill amend the criminal justice Act of 2001 which allows and requires a court to impose a custodial sentence for multiple burglary offences on a person's conviction on same and to impose consecutive sentences. That is only fair and is what justice demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Deputy Farrell mentioned an interesting report covered in <i>The Irish Times</i>. Some burglars are vicious, in particular those involved in the case in Tipperary. Some burglars seem to have a mean and more vicious streak. Criminologists look to the reasons that is the case. Yesterday, Deputy Farrell explained that such behaviour is put down to the desperate economic times we have had, including joblessness. From my observation, I would say it is somewhat of an insult to those who are unemployed because most of the individuals carrying out burglaries have never done a day's work in their lives. They are very inventive and creative when it comes to breaking into people's homes and destroying lives. That is why we have to be very severe with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> More prison places need to be provided because if a person is given time, they should be serving time. Many criminals coming before the courts do not have a fear of the prison system and do not care about going to jail.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">We might care about it because we are law-abiding and most law-abiding people are afraid of going to jail, but these guys are not. We must look at the regime in prison. Often people get out pretty quickly. Early or temporary release should be an exception and not the rule, but it is the rule currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> A person must want to be rehabilitated but clearly, based on these figures, these burglars who have previous convictions are not being rehabilitated. It is all good and well if a person wants to be rehabilitated. My colleague put it more politically correct by saying we want to dissuade people. They want to be left in no doubt that if they do the crime they will do the time. This is my attitude to it. The attitude they have at present is that they have no fear of law and order and no fear of prisons. This is a serious issue that must be addressed. I am not saying they should not be treated in a civilised manner. There should be no barbaric treatment, but it should be a lot leaner in prison than what it appears to be in some of the cases for some of the guys who are frequent offenders and who are in and out of a revolving door.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I very much welcome the other suite of measures the Minister has introduced and the investment undertaken. There is ongoing recruitment in Templemore. It has been quite debilitating for the Garda that for quite a number of years no new recruits have come into the system. As well as learning, gardaí need practical experience on the ground. The Garda has also lost older members through retirement and natural wastage. We have a gap and a difficulty in the Garda Síochána which is now being addressed with 550 people recruited between 2014 and 2015, with provision in the budget for a further 600 gardaí. I also welcome the provision of new Garda vehicles between the start of this year and the recent budget announcement, which will mean approximately 600 additional vehicles. The recent budget announced an investment of €5.3 million, which will bring the total invested in Garda vehicles since 2012 to €34 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Rural crime is a very sensitive issue because when it happens it is very severe and has a very deep impact on the people affected. It is causing a lot of fear. I would like to think many of our plans will be about empowering people and helping them to fight back in conjunction with the Garda. I am not speaking about vigilantism, but there comes a time when one gets sickened when one sees these guys going into court after tormenting and breaking into somebody's house and they have no shame whatsoever. We have to draw a line. I am delighted to see investment in the Garda text alert scheme because it is particularly helpful in rural areas. For a few hundred euro people in many communities around the country can look out for each other. Not only this, but they can connect with the Garda. Intelligence is passed around and it is a very good system. It is a very sound investment and I welcome the allocation of €397,000 for 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> A particular issue I have raised with the Minister is the provision of CCTV. There has been much talk about the closure of rural Garda stations, and without a doubt there was nothing much happening in them beyond the building itself and this is a fact. However, we need to help the Garda by providing more tools for rural policing. Rural CCTV through the main streets of towns and villages is critical. This is something in which the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, takes a particular interest in her portfolio. The amount of crime solved and how gardaí are assisted by CCTV is remarkable. Believe it or not, it is only in the past three years that my town, which is the largest in County Mayo, got CCTV on the back of RAPID funding from the Government. There needs to be co-operation between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, to ensure this is a feature and not <i>ad hoc</i>. Previous schemes which rolled out CCTV were not extended throughout the country and it was a case of whoever got in first. This must be done to give people hope that crimes can be solved and these criminals who are going around the country can be captured and put in their place, which is behind bars. It also requires investment in IT systems and general support for the Garda Síochána, who we know are out there at the coalface upholding law and order and keeping us all safe. I pay tribute to them all, particularly in light of the loss recently of Garda Tony Golden who was from my hometown.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">We have me. I am fortunate to live in a beautiful area in north Leitrim and to represent the beautiful constituency of Sligo-Leitrim North, which is mainly rural apart from Sligo town. Until ten or 15 years ago, in the wee town where I live almost every door was open and people could walk out and walk into a neighbour's house, sit down and have a cup of tea. Often, when people left their houses at night they would leave their doors open. It was marvellous. It was a lovely way to live. There was a certainty about life in rural Ireland until approximately 15 years ago. There was a sense of community and togetherness and several factors went into this. We had a rural economy for starters with small businesses in towns. People got by and were able to trade. They were able to keep the shops, post offices and pubs going. If people were lucky enough they might have a wee restaurant in the town as well. It was a lovely place to live. Our economy went south and the services in the towns and villages followed. I do not know which caused which; if the economy goes south it hits businesses and if businesses are hit it hits the economy. These two things happened over a very short timescale of approximately ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> Rural Ireland is now a colder place to live. From ten years ago when people could walk into a neighbour's house without knocking and put on the kettle for a cup of tea, we now have groups like Macra na Feirme embarking on campaigns such as know your neighbour day. Know your neighbour day in rural Ireland would have been unheard of just a short time ago. People knew their neighbours. People knew who they should call to and who might need help. Know your neighbour day would have seemed so alien in the rural Ireland of ten, 20 or 30 years ago. Not all change is improvement and it certainly is not for rural Ireland. I have not mentioned gardaí yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Another factor which has very badly hit rural areas is the loss of young people. It is a hugely critical factor. The fact a young person is not driving into the parents' or granny's house in the evening is so destabilising. It has caused so much damage in rural Ireland. In rural Ireland we now have middle-aged and older people, like myself, or very young children.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">A whole generation has gone to Australia or America and there has been internal migration as well. When a young lad or lassie leaves Manorhamilton for Dublin, he or she will travel up and down for a few weekends but such people eventually play their football and hurling in Dublin and will be lost to the rural area of north Leitrim. That damages the sense of togetherness and certainty in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> We are killing rural areas through policy and neglect. I understand it is difficult to have jobs at every crossroads but the centralisation of jobs in the major urban centres must be accompanied by a policy ensuring that appropriate businesses will be supported, with positive discrimination for appropriate businesses in rural towns. I am not saying that every rural town should have a big Apple facility, with thousands of people working in it. However, if the grant assistance and tax concessions go to the major urban centres, it will kill the small towns in rural Ireland. We need to proof every policy, and not just industrial issues, for the impact, good or bad, on rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> It is one thing to have post offices, shops and pubs closing, or only opening for a few hours per night because the owners cannot afford to stay open during the day, but the closure of the rural Garda stations was the final straw for some rural areas. The Garda station and its gardaí were more important than just being first responders in the event of a crime, although that is a very important role. They acted as a deterrent. People knew of a Garda station in an area, with the chance of a Garda car going by a house or keeping an eye out. For example, a garda might know that poor old Johnny down the road is vulnerable and keep an eye on him. That sense of deterrence is no longer there in rural communities. People had the sense that as long as the Garda station was there with gardaí in it, their interests were being watched over. It lent a sense of security and that somebody was protecting the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I know community organisations use text alert and have people visiting homes, meaning they can do a certain amount of excellent work. Nevertheless, communities were used to having a Garda presence in a station, so there is a major sense of loss. It does not take Einstein to figure out that as austerity increased, crimes such as theft and burglary also increased. If the heat is on in places like Dublin or Cork, thieves and burglars will head down the motorway and go to more vulnerable areas. I dare say that some burglars are looking at places where Garda stations are closing, and I would love to see some statistical analysis in that regard to determine if there has been an increase in burglary rates in the vicinity of closed Garda stations. I would be surprised if that was not the case. There was not a major saving to the Exchequer in closing the Garda stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> We have seen small savings for the Exchequer and an increase in opportunities for criminal activity, which in turn has increased fear and uncertainty while destroying the sense of comfort that vulnerable people had, particularly in rural areas. It was too high a cost to pay for a small Exchequer saving. As always under austerity, it is the poor, lonely, isolated and vulnerable who are hurt most. We welcome this Bill but it does not begin to address the root cause of the levels of criminal activity and negative consequences of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> My own beautiful constituency has suffered its own share of crime due to the closure of Garda stations. Today or yesterday, I read in the newspaper how a pub and shop business in a lovely place called Dromore West - it is a quiet and peaceful village - suffered a break-in, with a substantial amount of cash and cigarettes stolen. The nearest Garda station is now 30 miles away, and one would have lots of cigarettes and money taken from a place by the time a squad car would get there if the station is 30 miles away.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Is it any wonder that many older, vulnerable people living on their own are now going to bed with loaded shotguns? It is awful to see that and it should not happen in this country. We spent parts of the past two days here with the Government parties and Fianna Fáil trying to score cheap political points arising from the savage murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and others. Instead of debating bail laws, custody and sentencing, examining ways to better protect gardaí and the community or figuring out changes to make this country and its communities better for every vulnerable citizen and garda, we got jives, jeers, lies and politically inspired points scoring. That is no way to run a business or a country.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I would like this Bill to be seen as part of a process, with an urgent examination of the entire block of legislation that affects the security and comfort of people in this country. That would make a difference. Within five years, older, vulnerable people living on their own could then go to bed at night and have a sound sleep without having to bring a loaded shotgun with them.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">I welcome this Bill, which will toughen the criminal law in relation to burglars. Burglary is a crime which has always caused a particular anxiety in society. To be a victim of a burglary, to realise that an individual has broken into one's home, intruded on one's belongings and stolen items of value is an awful experience. I have had personal experience of having several bicycles stolen over the years. This may appear minor in comparison with other crimes, but this type of crime is unfortunately on the increase as a growing number of people have taken up cycling for healthy exercise or as a means of commuting. Tougher action needs to be taken against bicycle thieves, who are the modern equivalent of the horse thieves of the past. I also wish to refer to the trauma suffered by the Corcoran family in Killenaule, County Tipperary, including their three children, during an aggravated burglary of their home at night two years ago which shocked the entire nation. I hope the Bill will go some way towards preventing a similar catastrophe in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> This Bill is targeted at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions or who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. Figures from the Garda Síochána analysis service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. It is obvious, therefore, that a great many burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Targeting this cohort of repeat offenders has the potential to reduce significantly the number of burglaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> As a member of the Oireachtas justice committee, I am pleased this legislation has resulted from a review of the criminal justice system’s response to the problem of burglaries, which was initiated by the Minister earlier this year, and I commend her on doing that. As part of the review, the Minister convened and chaired a high-level meeting on the problem of burglaries, which was attended by the Garda Commissioner and representatives of the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service. The review highlighted that a significant number of burglaries are committed by a small number of offenders and targeting these prolific offenders has the potential to reduce significantly the harm being caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The new legislation will require the District Court to provide for consecutive jail sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences and it will allow courts to refuse bail for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges. Constitutionally, the legislation highlights the importance of the home as recognised by Article 40.5 of the Constitution which states, "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.” This legislation is an endorsement of the principle that a person’s home is his or her castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Considering the legislation in more detail, it requires, where a court decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple burglary offences committed within a 12-month window, that the court impose such sentences consecutively and not concurrently as is done frequently in Irish criminal law. This is in response to the fact that, in many cases, relatively short sentences are imposed when multiple burglary offences are taken into account. Section 2 will amend the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. It provides for the problem of concurrent sentences being handed down for multiple burglaries on the basis that where an adult is being sentenced to imprisonment for a domestic burglary and was convicted of another domestic burglary committed in the five years before the offence for which he or she is currently being sentenced, and was sentenced to imprisonment for another domestic burglary committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the burglary offence for which he or she is now being sentenced, any sentence of imprisonment the court chooses to impose for the offence for which he or she is currently being sentenced must be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment imposed for those prior domestic burglary offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The Bill provides that for the purposes of applications for bail, previous convictions for domestic burglary coupled with pending charges or recent convictions shall be considered as evidence that an accused person is likely to commit further domestic burglaries. This is in response to the fact that prolific offenders are repeatedly granted bail even when charged with a series of burglaries. It is important to point out here that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. This means that while the Legislature can define what is permissible in terms of sentencing in legislation, the Legislature is not able to tell a court what it can or cannot do in its day-to-day function. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. This legislation enhances that piece of law in the context of burglary offences, which are considered serious offences for the purposes of the Bail Act. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening on the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015. In doing so, I recognise that our criminal justice system is built on principles such as deterrence and punishment and the idea that people are deemed innocent until proven guilty. That is why we have bail provisions in the first place. This Bill makes two basic provisions, namely, that in granting bail in a domestic burglary case, the existence of certain circumstances must be considered as evidence that a person will commit subsequent burglaries and that prison sentences must run consecutively with sentences imposed for prior domestic burglary offences in certain circumstances. I would also submit a third provision, that where a person who is charged with a domestic burglary and had previously been convicted of a domestic burglary is granted bail, he or she would be electronically tagged.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> The provisions of this Bill, along with other Acts and Bills we have passed in the past few months, will mean more people will serve greater prison time and more resources will be used. However, I do not believe, for example, that prisons are the appropriate place for people who do not pay court-imposed fines. If a judge initially felt that a fine was the appropriate penalty, he or she would not have imposed anything else. It is simply unreasonable and abhorrent that those who are hit with fines eventually find themselves in prison. I fully support the legislation providing for attachment orders to wages and, if necessary, to social protection payments, as a sufficient deterrent in these situations. In the recent debate on rural crime and crime in general, a few facts have been lost. Ireland, by international standards, is a very safe place to live, work and visit. Rural Ireland, by national and international standards, is one of the safest places in the world in which to live, work and visit. That is not to undermine the great fear that exists in rural Ireland. This fear is matched by an irrational appetite in some quarters for unnecessary scaremongering. To quote Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i>, "Present fears. Are less than horrible imaginings". Some people in the countryside are paralysed, not by crime, but by the fear of crime, which is, in many cases, greater than it would be if they were ever exposed to a crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The home enjoys a very special constitutional status, but the problem here is that home burglaries are treated in the exact same way as other thefts, despite the fact that they are among the most traumatic events a person can experience. It is not to equate or compare crimes. If a person's home is burgled, he or she does not really care about the penalties, the debate or the palaver about other crimes. That is one of the most traumatic experiences anyone can have and it should be dealt with appropriately. A domestic burglary should be dealt with differently from other thefts, particularly thefts from commercial premises, or other petty crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> We have heard in recent weeks a lot of scaremongering, pointing out the obvious, and facts and figures, but very few solutions. There has been very little debate on what has been done. New gardaí are being recruited, Templemore is almost at capacity and new vehicles are being introduced. These and other initiatives which, to my knowledge, have not been mentioned, will be hugely effective in combatting rural crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">These are simple and efficient methods and include, for example, the community alert system. I particularly compliment the crime prevention officers of An Garda Síochána in my area and pay special tribute to Sergeant Ian O'Callaghan of the west Cork division who set up a Beara business watch where any suspicious activity is immediately circulated by text alert to businesses and residences, not to engage in vigilantism but merely to be informed. If people see suspicious activity, the gardaí are the appropriate people to deal with it, if they are aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> A number of American police forces and police in Sheffield in the United Kingdom have been trying a new method of predicting crime by recording details of crime, collating this information and detecting patterns to allocate resources more efficiently to combat possible future events. It sounds out of this world but it works. These pilot projects have had significant results. Will the Minister and her officials communicate this to the Garda to see whether it could replicate this initiative?</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Everyone carries a mobile phone or a smart phone and most of us can install software. For example, when one's phone is stolen, no matter what is done with it, one can find it. However, we have not yet figured this out for cars. I have tabled it as a Topical Issue when I will speak about it in more detail but I want to make one point. In regard to rural crime, I do not know of any situation where criminals go to Tipperary, Leitrim, Wexford or Kerry in their own cars. Typically, they travel in stolen cars. We have simple technology to detect stolen or lost phones but we cannot deter potential car thieves from stealing cars. Will the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality engage with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to immediately begin to roll out an initiative where cars can have a hardware device installed in them to inhibit the practice of stealing them? Cars are stolen for two reasons - for the value of the car and to commit crime. If we cut off that essential part of the crime chain, we will have done something significant to combat crime not only in the towns and cities but, more important, in rural areas. That, together with effective CCTV investment, will deal a strong blow against the criminals who roam the countryside.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> There are things we can do. I suggest to those who shout the loudest from podiums that rural Ireland is a dangerous place that they reflect on the damage they are doing and on the fear they are generating and start to reflect instead on the simple solutions that they, if they are as committed or as expert as they say, could bring to the table. I am sure we can all work in partnership to deal with this issue and ensure rural Ireland continues to be the safest place in the world to live.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_638">I thank Deputies Seán Kenny and Harrington for sharing time with me. I have two purposes in speak on this Bill. The first relates to the effect of burglaries of domestic dwellings on people and the fear it generates in the vicinity, which was eloquently spoken about by the previous speaker. The second purpose is to provide some solutions as to how we can deter criminals, who use the motorway network, from burglary, particularly of houses and businesses outside of the Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> I will speak on the latter first. I am of the opinion that big brother data are not something to be feared. I am okay if there is information out there about people, generated by State agencies for the purpose of detection of criminality, if they are, for the most part, law-abiding citizens who would like to see society developing in a safe and meaningful way. For example, there are cameras on the M50 and at the Red Cow roundabout, the purpose of which is to detect and log a licence plate numbers, which can also be detected at another junction on the road. They can estimate journey times. That collates into software for use in iPhones but it also collates into the expected journey times and the delays one hears broadcast on the radio. That information is currently not allowed to be provided to the Garda or to anybody in the justice system because it is only for use in traffic management. I would like to see a change in the law so we can use that information in the event we have to detect a car that has been stolen or, if we get to such a point, we can detect individuals because the cameras are of such high resolution that they can identify those driving the cars and they can have merit in a court case to be taken against the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> I would also like to see such use made of the Go Safe cameras. I have heard stories about how people did not want them outside their houses but now they say it would be wonderful if there was a Go Safe camera because it provides a form of security and provides back-up information, particularly in rural areas. That information could be collated. Ultimately, big data give information which provides the ability to detect and deter.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> We all have mobile phones and most of us have them registered in our own names but, unfortunately, the pay-as-you-go system is there to be abused because one can purchase such a mobile phone without having to register one's name and address and those of us who receive nasty texts and everything that goes with that might think that is only a light form of abuse. However, no society should have to tolerate somebody burgling a house in which there are young children and, potentially, tying up the residents and abusing them. There is something a little amiss that burglars can be back out on bail or can do concurrent sentences.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I am not all for long sentences. I believe in correctional facilities but also in a tagging system. If a person is out on bail, it is not a big deal if he or she is tagged. One form of use for the tagging system would be that criminals could be placed under house arrest rather being fed, watered and looked after by the State to the tune of between €80,000 to €100,000 per annum. If somebody has committed a crime, the last thing he or she should be is a burden on everybody else in society. He or she should be tagged and kept in his or her own house and, ultimately, should be responsible and held accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> One of the previous Government speakers spoke about the lack of fear of going to jail, that it has become something of a holiday. One hears reports on radio programmes, such as Joe Duffy's programme, of people who will not pay a fine because they will be out of jail before the gardaí even complete the paperwork. That is a crazy system. I accept we do not have enough prison places but is there an ability for us to develop as a society? I have many aspirations in this regard. As a Government backbencher, I am not in the most influential of positions but if we do not have solutions and aspirations to try to develop a better society, we will not make progress towards that end. We need to look at how we want criminals and the victims of criminality to be treated but we also need to look at deterrents and why people become criminals and why people become victims of criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> There is talk that security systems for homes might be allowed under a grant scheme, particularly outside the built-up areas, such as cities, but there is also the capacity to stop rural crime through a collective, cohesive effort by communities. In terms of community alert, for example, local authorities need to have a role as do schools whereby people are brought in, made to understand how community alert works and allowed to have a sense of belonging to and ownership of an area so they can play a role in helping people have a better and safer society.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">While I welcome some of the steps that are being taken, we have a long way to go and can resolve it using technology and a little goodwill from society.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">I will not get to cover much this evening. Out and about in Wexford at the weekends during the past few months, I have found one of the most talked-about issues is rural crime. One of the speakers said the issue was, to a great degree, more about the fear of crime than crime itself. However, in Wexford people would argue that crime happens a lot. Our statistics are frightening. Since 2008, crime figures have improved less in Wexford than in any other county. The second poorest performing area is Kilkenny and Carlow. The Garda Inspectorate’s report threw up many questions about the massaging of crime statistics. We are not sure if there is full reporting of crime in the area. It is frightening.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> The closing of Garda stations has been a major factor for many people. While one can make up all the reasons in the world for this and say the alternative works better, the people do not feel it, and it does not work better. There is much to be said for having a Garda station in every decent-sized village. The Government has estimated that the closure of Garda stations has saved approximately €4,000 per year per station. It does not stack up. It is not worth it, given the fear and the level of crime that is resulting.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I am delighted this Topical Issue is being taken. There is an inherent unfairness in the operation of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, higher education grant scheme in respect of certain citizens, and I ask that it be put right. Irish citizens who have been resident in this jurisdiction but leave to work as volunteers overseas, doing charitable development work for a number of years in some of the world’s least developed and poorest countries, who then wish to continue their education in Ireland, may be considered ineligible for a student grant solely because they do not meet the residency conditions under SUSI, which require them to have been resident in the State for at least three years out of the five-year period ending on the day before they start their approved course of study. I refer to cases in which these erstwhile volunteers do not have the financial means and cannot afford to pay for fees and maintenance at third level. Interestingly, had they stayed at home and been in receipt of social welfare for the three years, they would have qualified for a SUSI grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> To volunteer in this manner is a response to a noble call. While the experience is uplifting, personal sacrifice is required from the volunteers, as they give their time, knowledge and skills to empower and improve the lives of others and help in a practical way to counter some of the inequalities and hardships experienced by others just because of where on this planet they were born. These individuals should be supported by the State, not disenfranchised. The work of these volunteers, including emergency humanitarian action, is crucial to ensure the delivery of the Irish aid programme in various parts of the developing world. Delivering change for the better is one of the central priorities of Ireland’s foreign policy, and their work contributes to it. The 2016 budget has confirmed a commitment of €640 million for official development assistance, such is our commitment to overseas development.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> In 2013, the Government, as part of its commitment to volunteering, launched the Irish Aid volunteering initiative, which recognised the major contribution Irish volunteers have long made. The aim of the initiative is to strengthen support for overseas volunteering from the time when a person first considers going to when he or she returns home. The SUSI criteria which can see these volunteers deemed ineligible for higher education grants offends all the recognition and support that Government foreign policy strives to provide for them. Previously, an exemption from the residency clause had applied to overseas aid workers, which allowed them to qualify once they had passed the means test. This must be provided again. In September, the Minister, responding to an unfair discrimination which particularly affected youngsters in direct provision accommodation, extended the SUSI grant scheme to allow them to go to college.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to work with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Education and Skills to extend fair play to our overseas volunteers immediately. Although they are very few, it is unfair that after they have spent many years abroad doing voluntary service without making money by any standard, they find themselves disqualified on account of the fact that they have not been resident in recent years, especially given that we are telling them to go abroad. Something needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The student grant scheme will benefit some 80,000 students in the 2015-2016 academic year at a cost of approximately €350 million. In order to qualify for supports under the scheme, students have to meet a number of eligibility requirements, which are outlined in the Student Grant Scheme 2015. One of these requirements is the residency requirement, with which the Deputy has difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> The residency requirement provides that a student, as defined in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011, must demonstrate that he or she has been resident in the State for at least three years out of the five-year period ending on the day before the start of his or her approved course of study. Students must meet this criterion in order to be considered eligible for a maintenance grant. The rationale for the inclusion of a residency requirement in the student grant scheme is to ensure that those applying for a maintenance grant will have an established linkage with and be integrated into the State. This is a concept that is accepted across the EU. The residency requirement is also designed to obviate the risk of so-called grant tourism and prevent any abuse of the student grant scheme. There is, therefore, a very clear and robust rationale for including a residency requirement as part of the student grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is satisfied that the existing residency requirement contains sufficient flexibility to ensure it does not have an adverse impact on students. A student can meet the residency requirement if he or she has not been outside the State for more than two of the previous five years. This takes cognisance of students who may wish to take time out to travel or work outside the State, including in a voluntary capacity as in the case mentioned by Deputy Mulherin. It is important to note that students who do not meet the residency requirement at the outset of their studies have an opportunity to qualify for a maintenance grant if they meet the residency requirement during the course of their studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> In many respects, the requirements of this country's student grant scheme are more flexible than those of the schemes in other EU countries. To be eligible for support in Northern Ireland, a student must be resident in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for the three years immediately before he or she starts his or her course. A similar provision applies in Scotland and England. Access to student supports is even more restrictive in other parts of the EU. In Denmark, for example, an applicant for state education support must have resided in that country for a continuous period of at least five years. In light of the importance of a robust residency requirement as a precondition for accessing student supports, and the fact that the student grant scheme already provides a considerable degree of flexibility for students, it is not the Minister's intention to change the relevant criteria at this time. I know the Deputy has raised some specific issues, but the view is that the five-year rule allows for enough room for people to be able to manage these matters as well as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">I disagree totally with what the Minister of State has said. This issue was brought to my attention by an individual who is affected by it. The person in question, who has been doing excellent voluntary aid work with the likes of Médecins Sans Frontières in Africa and Afghanistan, wants to come back to Ireland to further their education in the field of overseas aid and development, but is unable to do so. This individual has no money and is trying to rely on the help of various family members. The current absurd approach runs contrary to this country's foreign policy and is incompatible with the esteem that has been afforded to volunteers, particularly by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the Irish Aid volunteering initiative, which I mentioned. All of this means nothing if the various Departments do not talk to each other. It has been suggested that if we make the change I am proposing, people will shop around as part of what has been described as "grant tourism", but surely we can verify whether someone has been working for a non-governmental organisation overseas, having previously lived here. Any time one travels to work in one of these countries, it is all very well documented. It seems to me that there would be no abuse of the approach I am proposing because the circumstances of voluntary work overseas lend themselves to standing up to scrutiny. Such an approach would still allow our talented young people, who have enjoyed many privileges while living here, to give something back by going to these countries. I remind the House that their efforts are not an incidental part of the delivery of this country's aid programme. There seems to be no recognition of the crucial role they play.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> On the question of showing flexibility to students, I reiterate that no flexibility is being shown in the case I have highlighted. This person has been left high and dry. I have referred to the Minister's enlightened decision to open the higher education grant scheme to youngsters living in direct provision who have been through our education system but whose residency and citizenship status is in limbo. I agree that these young people need to be looked after, but why can we not look after our own people in the circumstances I have outlined? The change I am recommending would not affect thousands and thousands of people. I remind the Minister of State that a means test is required in these cases. Anyone who is paid a salary for working for an Irish aid organisation overseas will obviously have that money in the bank when they come back. I am talking about volunteers, however. Can we not do something better for them? I find the Minister of State's response very unsatisfactory. I have written to the Minister on this issue. I cannot change my view on account of anything the Minister of State has said. These are real cases involving real people. We should not discourage them from doing a very worthwhile thing on behalf of this country in order to improve the circumstances of people in other parts of the world.</p>

            <p eId="para_664">I want to make it clear that I was not trying to change the Deputy's view. I completely understand and empathise with the circumstances of the case she has raised. We try to encourage people to do voluntary work when they have time to do so, as many people have had in recent years. The difficulty is that there is no discretion with the residency requirement. The Student Support Act 2011 makes no provision for any exemptions in the cases of those who do not meet the residency requirements. Those requirements apply equally to everyone in respect of their individual circumstances. That has to be the case. The requirements of most of the schemes we operate have to be applied equally across the board. Regardless of whether one was working abroad, one was overseas as a volunteer or one does not meet the requirements because one was in some other scenario, those requirements have to be applied equally. I remind the Deputy that in recognition of people's movements in recent years, the rules were changed in the 2010-11 student year. Under the previous scheme, one needed to have been resident in Ireland for the year prior to one's application to go to college to do a course. Now that the rules have been changed to make the scheme more flexible, one needs to have been resident here for two of the previous five years. I think the rules were changed to allow for certain scenarios. There will always be cases in which people do not meet the criteria. These things are always under review. There is no scope for flexibility under the current guidelines or regulations. New legislation would be needed to-----</p>

I think she will accept that all our schemes need to have criteria. She mentioned the changes that were made to facilitate asylum seekers. The condition that applies to them is that they must have been resident in the State for the previous five years. It is even more strict. It is not the case that an easier set of rules applies to asylum seekers. They are now allowed to apply if they have been here for five years. That was announced in August.</p>

            <p eId="para_671">I want to speak about the urgent need for new school building projects in Monasterevin, County Kildare. Everybody in the town knows that the primary schools and the secondary school in the town need new buildings because of the old, cramped conditions that prevail in both school locations at present. I have visited all the schools in Monasterevin on a few occasions. My first visit was in the presence of the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and my party colleague, Deputy Ó Fearghaíl, who emphasised to the Minister the urgent need for these projects to be moved along. During those visits and on various subsequent occasions, I have met, spoken to and had a great deal of contact with the principals and staff members of the three schools in question. I thank the principals for their determination in pushing these important projects forward. If principals do not push these things, they can sometimes be left behind. The three principals in Monasterevin are working in a dedicated manner in the interests of the students in their schools. There is nothing in it for them; it is all about the children of the schools. It has to be acknowledged that the boards of management in all three schools are very supportive. Equally, the parents' council in each school is very much behind what the school authorities are doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> There are two separate issues in Monasterevin. The development of St. Paul's secondary school, which has a large number of students, is a bit more advanced. That school is based on a very cramped site and its buildings are very poor. I would call many of the structures glorified prefabs. In this day and age, we should be long past having projects and schools like that in operation. That is why it is good that everyone has agreed to the Moore Abbey site. This site has already been provided and dealt with by the Department of Education and Skills. Kildare County Council is happy with it. Traffic issues will arise because the site is on a busy road in the centre of the town as one comes into Monasterevin from Athy via the Kildangan road. This project has been on the building programme prior to now, but it has not been moving very fast. Other school projects have moved much more quickly. It is important for this project to be given priority now. We really want to ensure permission is given for the project to proceed to construction in 2016. At this stage, the detailed designs have been completed. A report was submitted to the Department on 25 September and is currently under review. I have raised both of these issues in parliamentary questions in recent times. I ask the Department to clear the report immediately on the basis that there are no issues arising so that a planning application can be submitted; the fire safety certificate, the disabled access certification and the tender documents can be prepared; construction can start as early as possible in 2016; and the school can come fully into operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> Everybody in the locality is aware that there are over 500 students in the two primary schools - a girls' school, Scoil Eimhin Naofa, and a boys' school, Scoil Náisiúnta Naomh Pheadar - in Monasterevin.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">The schools have done the right thing by agreeing to amalgamate. The principals, teaching staff, boards of management and parents should be rewarded for this by having the project relating to the new school fast-tracked. They intend to move onto the site of the current girls school where there is more space available. I ask that this project be included in the six-year construction plan that the Minister for Education and Skills is expected to announce in the coming days. It is essential that this project be included in that plan and that it be fast-tracked, with construction commencing in 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because it gives me the opportunity to remind the House of the significant challenges facing the Department in terms of meeting increasing demand for pupil places throughout the country in the coming years. It also presents me with the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of school places in Monasterevin, County Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> The Deputy will be aware that the country has experienced an unprecedented population increase in recent years. This demographic growth has posed a significant challenge regarding the provision of school places and that challenge is set to continue. The demographic projections show that enrolment at primary level will continue to increase substantially until at least 2019. Primary school enrolments, which stood at 509,652 in July 2011, are expected to increase to 570,000 by 2018, which equates to an increase in enrolments of over 64,000 since July 2011. Post-primary school enrolments, which stood at 317,432 in July 2011, are expected to increase to 385,000 by 2022, which equates to an increase in enrolments of some 68,000 since July 2011. The demand for additional school places in the post-primary sector will continue to increase until at least 2025, when enrolment figures are expected to reach in excess of 400,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> In the context of school provision in Monasterevin, the Deputy is aware that architectural planning has commenced for two major building projects that are intended to meet current and future demand at both primary and post-primary level. In the case of primary school provision, a new 24-classroom school will be constructed to host the amalgamation of Scoil Eimhin Naofa and St. Peter's Boys' National School. The current position relating to the proposed building project is that the pre-stage 1 meeting was held with the school and its design team in November 2014 and the Department requested that they address a number of points as part of the stage 1 report. Subsequently, an addendum to the stage 1 report was furnished to the Department by the board of management and design team on 18 August last and the project has now been authorised to progress to stage 2(a), which is the developed sketch design stage. Upon successful completion of stage 2(a) and subject to no issues arising, the project will be authorised to proceed to stage 2(b), the detailed design stage, which includes applications for planning permission, fire safety certification, disability access certification and the preparation of tender documents. While the project was not included in the current five-year construction programme, school building projects, including this project, are being progressed to the final planning stages and are available to be considered in the context of the new six-year construction plan which the Minister intends to announce in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> The position relating to post-primary provision in Monasterevin is that architectural planning is also advancing to provide a replacement school for St. Paul's secondary school. When complete, the school will not only cater for the current pupil cohort but will also provide for additional post-primary school places to meet future needs. Following the pre-stage 1 meeting in February 2015, this project was authorised to progress to stage 2(a), which is the developed sketch design stage. The stage 2(a) meeting was held in the Department last June and the school and its design team were requested to complete and submit the stage 2(a) report to the Department. This report was received in the Department on 25 September and is currently under review. Matters relating to services to and from the site remain under discussion between the design team and the local authority. Upon successful completion of stage 2(a) and subject to no issues arising, this project will then be authorised to proceed to stage 2(b), the detailed design stage, which includes applications for planning permission, fire safety certification, disability access certification and the preparation of tender documents. This project is included on the current five year construction programme announced in 2012 and is listed on the programme to proceed to tender and construction in 2015/16. To be clear, the money for that project is ring-fenced and has been set aside, as the Deputy is probably aware. It is important that the project progresses through all of the stages so that we can spend the money in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> The Deputy will also be aware that significant capital funding will be invested in our education system through the Government's €27 billion capital programme announced on 29 September last. In the next six years, some €3.8 billion in direct funding will be invested in education projects. By comparison, the initial allocation under the previous five year capital programme was €2.2 billion. We are certainly making a lot of progress in terms of allocating resources to various projects. This means that there has been a significant increase in funding to match demand. This level of allocation allows the Department of Education and Skills to deliver some 19,000 additional permanent primary school places required by 2019 and 43,000 additional post primary school places required by 2022.</p>

            <p eId="para_680">I thank the Minister of State for putting this up-to-date report on the record of the House. It corresponds substantially with the information I received in response to a parliamentary question I tabled on 13 October. I have been following this issue carefully and I raise it again today to try to ensure that the primary school project progresses to the next stage and is included in the next capital plan to be announced in the coming weeks. I know that there will be pressure from many schools in that regard. I will not even ask the Minister or Minister of State to visit the school in question because the case for a new building is well made and proves itself. Indeed, the need for both projects to proceed as quickly as possible is undeniable.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> I wish to provide the Minister of State with additional information regarding the boys school. Such is the level of enrolment at the school that an extra classroom was approved based on the numbers at 30 September 2014. The school has made a planning application for that classroom. While we know this is only a temporary arrangement, the classroom must be provided before the new amalgamated school building is provided. The school is awaiting permission from Kildare County Council to commence the building works. It is waiting for the fire certificate to be approved and the disability access certificate to be granted by the local authority. It cannot issue a commencement notice until this documentation is provided but it is not expected before 15 November, which is awful. This will delay the construction of the new classroom which pupils should be in by now. The principal wrote to me and said that a class of 31 six and seven year olds is currently housed in the school library on foot of what the school believed would be a very short-term arrangement. The school believed that the classroom would be in place by now. The library stock of books and other resources had to be put into storage. This is not an acceptable situation but it illustrates perfectly the growing pressure on the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> Another issue arises with regard to the proposed new school. I stood on Drogheda Street outside the girls school and the traffic situation there is unacceptable. There is very little space for cars to pull in, which makes dropping children to school very difficult. It is very important that a proper traffic management plan be included in the planning application in the interests of the children and those who are dropping them off.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> I urge the Minister of State to push both of these projects on in the context of new construction programme that will be announced shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_684">As the Deputy knows, the money for the second level school is ring fenced. That project is included in the current five year plan so there is no reason why it cannot progress to construction next year. The proposed amalgamated school is progressing through all of the stages and that project is in a strong position for inclusion in the forthcoming six-year plan to be announced in the coming weeks. That plan is evidence based and aims to provide additional accommodation for students in areas of need. The fact that enrolment in the schools in question has been increasing will help their case. Decisions will be made on the basis of research into future needs in various areas conducted over the last six to eight months by the relevant departmental unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> Regarding the classroom that the school wishes to build this year, my Department does a lot to magic up the money to build schools but local planning decisions are the responsibility of local authorities. That issue is best left to the Deputy and his party's local councillors. The Department cannot solve that particular problem but the money is available for the classroom.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">I thank the Minister of State for remaining in the House so late on a Thursday evening. He has drawn the short straw.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> Crime is an issue that needs constant and careful consideration and investment. It is an ubiquitous issue that invariably becomes heated in advance of a general election but there is a real security threat that can be dealt with simply by better use of technology. Much of the recent hyperbole surrounding rural crime fails spectacularly to offer real solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> During a recent debate in the House I referenced the fact that one can install software on a mobile phone so that should it be lost or stolen it can be tracked down, even if it is switched off. This can be done very easily and cheaply. There is one common denominator linking almost every crime, including rural crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">Criminals do not use their own cars when travelling to commit crimes. They steal vehicles to do so, sometimes weeks or months in advance of committing the crime. I propose that tracking devices or software be installed or retrofitted on a phased basis on all cars and vehicles. Where a vehicle with tracking software was stolen, the owner could report the theft to the Garda, providing either a password or key that would allow the Garda to track the vehicle electronically. Owners would not track their vehicles as to do so would expose them to great risk. The criminals involved are at their most vulnerable in the period between the theft of the car from an innocent owner's driveway and the point at which it enters a secure lock-up or breaker's yard. Criminals know that stolen cars can blend in with other traffic on the streets, highways and motorways. However, if a tracking device is activated, a stolen car will, from a technological perspective, light up like a Christmas tree. Garda resources, which are in great demand, could then be targeted at tracking stolen cars, rather than used in a random manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> The installation and activation of tracking software requires the support and co-operation of the Departments of Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to raise this matter with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in the first instance, and request that it liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality. Tracking technology could be rolled out alongside the new technology to be installed in Garda stations under the capital plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, would also have to co-operate with the roll-out of tracking software. While SIMI will deny this is the case, its members benefit from car theft because stolen vehicles must be replaced or, in the case of damage, repaired. The co-operation of the Insurance Federation of Ireland would also be key. </p>
            <p eId="para_692"> I ask the Department to introduce incentives and legislation to commence the immediate roll-out of tracking devices and software to enable one link in the chain of crime, the stolen car, to be removed. If one takes stolen cars from criminals, one removes a vital cog from their apparatus.</p>

            <p eId="para_694"> I welcome the Deputy's intentions in raising this important issue. While the offence of taking a vehicle without the lawful authority of the owner is provided for in section 112 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, matters relating to the investigation and consequent recovery of stolen vehicles are a matter for An Garda Síochána. As the Deputy indicated, this issue comes within the remit of two Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Setting aside any civil libertarian or data protection considerations related to statutorily providing for the fitting of such tracking devices to motor vehicles, from a vehicle standards perspective, the Minister is not aware of any European Union proposals mandating the fitting of location tracking devices for the specific purpose of tracking stolen vehicles. European regulations set out the type approval requirements for member states to adopt, so that no member state may impose any additional requirements that would present a barrier to the cross-border trade in motor vehicles in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> While such tracking devices are currently available for purchase by individual car owners for fitting to their vehicles, the choice to purchase and use such a device is entirely a matter for the individual citizen. To legislate for the fitting of such devices would require that the appropriate standards, testing and verification procedures, as well as the enforcement of a failure to fit such a device, would have to be carefully determined. In essence, providing for a legal requirement to fit such a tracking device would also involve making the failure to fit such a device a criminal offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> The Minister's primary function in respect of road traffic is to promote and ensure that the most appropriate and best practice road safety and vehicle engineering safety standards are implemented in order that any potential road traffic collisions and consequent injuries and fatalities on Ireland's road network are reduced. Given the primary remit of the Minister and Road Safety Authority in promoting road safety and the necessity to meet EU type approval requirements for vehicle standards, the Minister has no proposals to introduce regulations mandating the fitting of locations tracking devices in order to track stolen vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> The Deputy raised an interesting example and this technology would have benefits across many Departments. I will convey his idea to the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport. It may be possible to raise this matter at European level. I will join the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Environment, Community and Local Government in meeting the Commissioner with responsibility for the competition agenda next week. The recent issue concerning Volkswagen will be discussed at the meeting. I will raise the matter at the meeting and I would be pleased to pursue or investigate it at European level. If such a step were to be taken, it would have to be done at European level.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Harrington<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_699">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I acknowledge that devices are available for purchase by individual car owners and that it is entirely a matter for owners if they wish to do so. What would be the point of tracking one's stolen vehicle to a lock-up or breaker's yard that is being manned by criminals? The car owner would probably not be able to pass the information to the Garda because it would be too late. The tracking devices currently available can generally be dismantled. While it may well be easy to dismantle them, at least under my proposal Garda would have access to information on stolen vehicles at the critical time, namely, in the period between theft and storage. If criminals believe or realise that one of these devices is fitted to a car, would they be prepared to risk coming under immediate Garda surveillance and getting caught?</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> I accept that a multi-agency approach is required, specifically co-operation between the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality. Deputies repeatedly encounter the silo aspect of Government. Different Ministers have responsibility for different Departments and problems arise when one raises an issue that traverses Departments. This culture needs to be addressed. </p>
            <p eId="para_701"> Tracking technology is improving and becoming cheaper all the time. We need to find a legislative solution for implementing a technological framework that would revolutionise the capacity of the Garda Síochána to combat crime, particularly mobile crime, by taking the legs from under the criminal. The Government must give this issue much greater priority, especially against the background of the earlier debate on criminal justice legislation and the public discussion that has taken place in recent weeks. </p>
            <p eId="para_702"> I urge the Minister of State to raise this issue with the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality. I suggest that a feasibility study and pre-legislative work be done to assess whether there are any pitfalls in my proposal. A legislative solution could be found that enables the use of this existing technology. Additional resources are being provided to the Garda, including new recruits and extra vehicles. Smart policing means we must give serious consideration to using technology to beat criminals. Investment in tracking technology would deliver a significant return to the State. I urge the Minister to take my proposal to the appropriate Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">As I stated, I have no problem conveying the Deputy's proposal to both the relevant Departments. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would have liked to have been in the House to respond on this issue. This matter is not one for national governments as we are subject to clear European regulations in respect of type approval requirements for vehicles. I stress, therefore, that any solution needs to be provided at European level. That is not to say the Government cannot push the issue. However, European regulations would be required before the Deputy's proposal could be implemented. I do not have a problem raising the issue on behalf of the Deputy when we meet the Commissioner next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">I am also happy to bring this to further meetings and to encourage the two Ministers to take it on.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> It is not at all a case of silo government. In the last three or four years, there has been a great deal more joined-up thinking in Departments. I am a vivid example of this as I am at two Departments. It is very stressful when one is trying to work in two Departments. Joking aside, we recognise that we need to have cross-government decision-making and Departments working together. That will not be a blockage here. It is doable, it is not a blockage that it needs to be sponsored by two Departments. It is something that needs to challenged at a European level. There are two and more excellent MEPs the Deputy can link with to drive the agenda. I will certainly raise it at EU Commission level and our Ministers will bring it forward here. Something like this needs a co-ordinated approach across the board, but it is doable when it is co-ordinated properly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_706">At the end of August of this year, working in collaboration with Ms Susan Gray and the PARC road safety group, I received a reply from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to my Parliamentary Question No. 511 of 14 July. The reply detailed by district court the number of persons listed and convicted and licence numbers recorded for drink driving offences between January 2013 and May 2015. Ms Susan Gray and PARC have done and, indeed, continue to do Trojan work in the area of road safety, highlighting loopholes in our legislation and the failure to implement our traffic laws. It was through representations by PARC and its analysis of the figures that we uncovered the shocking level of drink driving prosecutions not resulting in convictions as highlighted by <i>The Irish Times</i> this week. Of the 20,000 plus cases listed between January 2013 and May 2015, just 8,391, or 40%, received a conviction while a minuscule 1,647, or 20%, had their licence details recorded in court. County Offaly had the highest rate of convictions at 68%, County Kerry had the lowest at 29% and 21 out of the Twenty-six Counties had lower than 50% conviction rates. These figures are unacceptable and compare very badly with our UK and other EU neighbours. The UK has a 97% conviction rate for drink driving prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> The response of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to the media in light of these worrying figures was that his Department's officials had begun work on consolidating our comprehensive Road Traffic Acts. I remember asking the Minister about this previously and he told me in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 611 on the 24 January:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_708">As I indicated to the House in December last, I propose to begin the process of consolidating road traffic legislation this year. A considerable amount of work is involved in this exercise involving as it does the examination and review of all primary and secondary legislation going back to 1961.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">He re-iterated that the work would commence this year, but we are still waiting. This type of behaviour by the Government in kicking the can down the road has become commonplace in a range of policy areas including housing, health care, Irish Water and, now, the safety of road users in Ireland. Yet another example of this was the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and, specifically, its Minister misleading the Dáil on the issue of breathalyzer test reports being produced and presented in both English and Irish. A month ago, Mr. Justice Seamus Noonan in the High Court ruled that these reports must be provided in both languages. On 24 March of this year, however, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in response to concerns of PARC and myself, reassured me in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 984 on this very issue. I had asked him to amend Statutory Instrument No. 541 of the Road Traffic Act 2011 to close any possible loophole. He said, "I am satisfied following consultation with the Garda that there is no requirement to change the Road Traffic Act 2010 to make amendments of the kind suggested by the Deputy". Yet, six months after this statement, a High Court judge disagreed with his interpretation of the law. It is unfortunate that the Minister is not here to take part in this debate. It is clear he misled the Dáil. The Acting Chairman is a senior parliamentarian and will agree that he should come to the House and correct the record. He misled the Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">He gave wrong information to Dáil Éireann on this very serious matter in relation to drink driving. Today, <i>The Irish Times</i> covered another shocking story and reported that between January 2013 and March 2015 521 drivers were already disqualified at the time of conviction for involvement in a collision causing serious injury or death. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, could not tell us how many of these drivers were actually disqualified when these serious crashes took place. Figures released to me by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, show that 17,481 drivers were disqualified for road traffic offences in the same timeframe. However, on 9 April this year, the RSA reported to me that it had informed the Garda of just 48 disqualifications. These are also very serious figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> We have heard from sources in the Courts Service that it considers that there is no requirement in law to record the licence when a driver is disqualified in court. While the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, has been thrown in at the deep end by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, I ask him to confirm if it is the case that there is no requirement in legislation for the Courts Service to record the licence of a disqualified driver. That will be a key aspect of the Minister of State's reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> A key aspect of this issue is the cut in personnel and resources of An Garda Síochána carried out by this and the previous Government in the austerity years since the great recession. There has especially been a cut in the traffic corps. The figures released also put the spotlight on the Courts Service, the performance of some district judges and the seemingly Flann O'Brien or Kafkaesque atmosphere of some District Courts. It is time for accountability and for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House to clarify two important points of law which I put to him this afternoon. I put them to the Minister of State now albeit I know he is not briefed to reply. I ask that the Minister, Deputy Donoghoe, come in at the earliest opportunity. The Acting Chairman was making these very points today and is the very man to ask the Minister to come to the House and correct the record.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I am here to respond to the issue the Deputy raised which was the urgent need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to bring forward consolidated road traffic legislation before the end of the Government's term given the recent revelations. That is the issue the Deputy raised and that is the issue I am responding to. I apologise on behalf of the Minister who could not make it here this evening. The Deputy knows that the nature of his office means it is not always possible to change his diary and attend here. I have no doubt that he would like to be here. I record that it is not in the nature of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to mislead the Dáil. I have no doubt that he will address the issue the Deputy raised there because it is not in his nature. The Deputy knows the man well and that it is not something he does. The Deputy will be willing to admit that.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> We are currently working on a road traffic Bill 2015 with the intention of enacting it before the end of the year. It is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel at present. This is the current priority in road traffic legislation and will be dealt with before consolidation can begin. The principal focus of the Bill is on measures to address driving under the influence of drugs. The new provisions will enable gardaí to conduct roadside tests for the presence of drugs, make the presence of certain specified drugs while driving an offence, and provide for tougher penalties for those driving under the influence of multiple drugs, or drugs in combination with alcohol. The Bill will also include measures to ensure mutual recognition of driver disqualifications between Ireland and the UK and create an option for road authorities to introduce a 20 km/h speed limit in built-up areas. After the passage of the 2015 Bill, the Department will begin examining the process of consolidation, which is the issue the Deputy has raised. This will, as a first step, involve a scoping exercise to estimate what is necessary, how much time will be required, and what resources will need to be allocated to the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> Road traffic legislation in Ireland is based on the Road Traffic Act 1961. This has been amended numerous times. There have been 15 Road Traffic Acts since that of 1961. There have also been other Acts which have made material changes to road traffic law including the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975, the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act 1987, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006, the Road Safety Authority Act 2006, and the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012. There has been widespread agreement for some time that the legislation in this area has become extremely complex and is in need of consolidation. That is exactly what the Deputy is raising tonight and we all agree with him. Certainly, the Department agrees. We are committed as a Government to doing this. However, this is not a short-term project. It cannot be completed in a couple of months. As someone who was involved in the Companies Act consolidation process, I note that it is a lengthy process if it is to be done right. Consolidation will require more than passage of the legislation as it currently stands in a single Act. It will entail careful review of the legislation being consolidated in order to identify points where it can be clarified, simplified and improved. Consolidation will lead to much stronger legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> A project of this kind will require time and resources, and will take a number of years. This, for example, has been the case with the Companies Acts and the Finance Acts previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">None the less, as these precedents have shown and as I can attest to, having been a part of that process, it is worth doing. It is worth taking the time to get it right as such a consolidation can be expected to be the basis of road traffic law for many decades to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_723"> While consolidation will be a major step forward, we need to be realistic and remember that it will not solve every problem. Road traffic legislation is perhaps the most frequently contested legislation in the land and is likely to remain so. This is only right as people are entitled to challenge the law in the courts and it is the proper constitutional role of the courts to interpret legislation. We should be aware that consolidation, while it should simplify and improve matters, will not bring an end to this process. However, it will help outcomes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2015-10-22T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_724">To date this year, 127 people have lost their lives on the roads and many hundreds more families have been traumatised by serious injuries. When I was transport spokesperson, it was calculated that each fatality cost our nation €2 million plus. It is a costly and terrible situation in terms of the personal pain of those individuals and families. Therefore, why does the Government not get the requisite number of young barristers and solicitors working on this issue and introduce a consolidated Bill? The Minister of State could at least give a commitment to the effect that this would be a priority given the large death toll. If a single incident caused 127 deaths or the almost 200 deaths last year, the House would launch major commissions of investigation that would last for months.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> Will the Minister of State have the Minister clarify the two points of law I have raised concerning drink-driving printouts and disqualified drivers? Will he confirm that these are not included in the legislation? The Minister of State referred to the 2015 Bill on the legislative programme. It relates to drug driving and the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK. Would it not be possible to address in that Bill the two matters I raised as well as issues such as the non-presentation of licences in court and references by judges to court poor boxes despite senior judges' assertions that the latter is incorrect in law?</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> What of addressing the registering of fixed charge notices in order that people cannot claim they did not receive one? We are living in the e-mail era and have passed beyond the pony and trap and bicycle for mail deliveries. Why can we not have notices which we all know are actually being received by the intended persons? Will the Government address the fixed charge processing system? The working group recommended that if someone could not pay after the 56-day period, he or she would get a third payment option and not have to waste the court's time. Could these issues be addressed in the forthcoming legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> Some 77% of drivers summonsed for penalty point offences between 2013 and early summer 2015 were not convicted. Of those convicted, 72% did not present their licences. Some 60% of drunk drivers were not convicted. Of those convicted, 80% did not have their licence numbers recorded. Some 71% of drivers using mobile telephones were not convicted while, of those convicted, 41% did not have their licence numbers recorded. Some 96% of drivers disqualified in court did not surrender their licences and 89% of those convicted did not present their licences. The court poor box is still being used despite a High Court ruling.</p>
            <p eId="para_728"> As someone who has served with distinction for decades in the House, the Acting Chairman will agree that road traffic law is in crisis. Given the horrendous deaths and casualties on our roads, we need to grasp this matter, deal with it effectively and change a culture that still permits many of our fellow citizens to die on the roads needlessly.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I agree with Deputy Broughan that this is a cultural issue. All the changes in the world to road traffic law will not be enough to stop every tragic death. Even one road death is one too many. Thankfully, there has been considerable improvement in road safety and the numbers killed in the past ten or 15 years. This has been due to successive Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_730"> This is a cross-party issue that we all buy into and there is no problem in this regard. I assure the Deputy that tackling it is a priority for the Government. The consolidation process will form part of that work. The Deputy is right that we should try to fast-track it and learn from other consolidation processes. For example, I was involved in the company law consolidation process which we were able to move along more quickly in some cases than we anticipated. We should do that in this case. Extra resources were found in terms of man hours for that work. Likewise, the same should be done in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> There will be a drive to make this happen. It makes it easier for the interpreters of legislation and will undoubtedly lead to better outcomes if the law is consolidated. Road safety and deaths on our roads from accidents or, as I call them, incidents-----</p>

            <p eId="para_733">Most incidents on the road are avoidable, so they are not accidents. It is a cultural issue that goes way beyond transport, law or the Department of Justice and Equality. It stretches into education and awareness of the problem. Most people try the lottery every now and again because they believe they can win. They see the ads that say, "It could be you." They roll the dice and try, but they never consider the negatives. Most people assume they will never be in road traffic incidents, yet the chances of it are much higher than of them winning the lottery. There is something wrong with people's mindsets. It is in all of us. We have an attitudinal issue towards road safety. This is an issue that must be driven by every Department. I am in the Department of Education and Skills which has a major role to play in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> Incidents and accidents can happen to anyone. It is in everyone's gift to prevent them on our roads. Legislation is a part of that work. I will bring the Deputy's questions that I could not answer to the relevant Ministers and reply to him with detailed answers.</p>
