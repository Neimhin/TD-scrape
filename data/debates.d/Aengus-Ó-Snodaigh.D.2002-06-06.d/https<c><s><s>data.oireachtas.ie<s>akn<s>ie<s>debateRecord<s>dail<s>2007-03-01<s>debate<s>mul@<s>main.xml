          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the early implementation of a universal, new-born hearing screening programme, such as the one which has been in widespread use in the USA since 1964; the admission by HSE chief executive, Professor Drumm, that such a programme had not been implemented with the desired speed; the proven evidence that new-born hearing screening leads to earlier identification and treatment of children with hearing loss, and the effectiveness of screening in contributing to positive outcomes for early-identified, deaf babies.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the systems in place to monitor convicted sex offenders, especially those convicted of charges relating to minors and systematic sexual offenders following their release from prison and those convicted offenders who have been placed on the sex offenders' register and to further debate what notification procedures are in place for the Garda and victims to inform them of releases.  I seek also to provide the relevant Ministers with an opportunity to outline which bodies or agencies, if any, are consulted or involved in the run-up to and subsequent release of a convicted sex offender to facilitate continued monitoring, appropriate housing allocation and counselling services aimed at addressing the behaviour which led to the original conviction.</p>

          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to reverse the decision to close Swiss Cottage, Cahir, County Tipperary, to the public for the coming tourism season and to provide immediately alternative, temporary access, which is available.  Swiss Cottage is a unique architectural gem, one of the most popular heritage sites in the country and vital to south Tipperary's tourism industry.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_5">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Government to respond to the latest illegal Israeli military incursion into Nablus in the Palestinian West Bank by enforcing emergency economic sanctions on Israel.  The latest assault, which commenced last Sunday and was heightened yesterday, has involved some 120 military vehicles, bulldozers and armoured jeeps entering the town, piling up rubble to block roads, besieging three hospitals, actively preventing Palestinian ambulances from approaching the hospitals, placing many thousands of Palestinian civilians under curfew and forcing schools and universities to close.  Israeli occupying forces killed and wounded Palestinian civilians and forced young Palestinians to act as their human shields.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">It is not agreed.  I understand there are 123 amendments to be dealt with on Report Stage.  The time afforded to deal with that is not acceptable.  While many Ministers wish to place legacy items on their records as they leave office, this is not an acceptable way to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">The Labour Party opposes the proposal also.  To provide 90 minutes at most to take 123 amendments, most of which have been tabled by the Minister, is to fail to provide an adequate opportunity to debate them.  Never in the history of Dáil Éireann has the passage from Opposition to Government wrought so great a transformation on a Deputy as it has in the case of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I hope sincerely that he will not persist in trampling on the right of the House to scrutinise legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">If the Minister wishes to find a solution, I draw his attention to the fact that three hours have been provided for debate on the Defence Bill.  There is no reason we cannot extend the time for consideration of Report Stage of the Building Control Bill into some of the time set aside to take the Defence Bill.  Why should there be a guillotine this evening on the Defence Bill when we could resume its consideration at a time when the Minister for Defence is available to attend the House?  He is otherwise engaged today.  I ask the Minister to offer additional time to consider the Building Control Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">The Building Control Bill is so vital in respect of energy consumption and quality of life for our people that it is a gross insult, not just to this House, but to the wider public to say it can be wrapped up, sealed and signed in a 90-minute period.  I previously raised the fact that Sustainable Energy Ireland research states that only 2% of homes in Ireland comply with the basic Part L of the Building Regulations 2002.  We are clearly not controlling building in any form or fashion.</p>

There is no reason this debate should be curtailed to 90 minutes or so and I am opposed to the guillotine on this Bill, as I have opposed guillotines on other legislation.  We should be allowed the time required to have a proper debate, especially since there are several amendments which require full debate in which all Members of the House can take part, rather than just a Committee Stage debate where Members do not have the opportunity to table amendments unless they are members of the relevant committee.</p>

Section 4 provides for the amendment of the Building Control Act 1990 to provide for revised procedures with regard to revised fire safety certification and disability access certification of buildings.  The categories of work cited under this section refer to new buildings, extensions or material alterations.  The amendment provides that where reference is made to the category of work as a material alteration of a building, it will be construed as including a material change of use, not just works on a building.  A change of use may have implications for fire safety standards and brings the section into line with the 1990 building regulations.</p>

Since Committee Stage my Department has considered this matter with the parliamentary draftsmen.  Our amendments Nos. 56 and 57 will meet the Deputy's concern.  It is preferable to preventing the coming into effect of the prohibition of the unlawful use of the title of architect under section 15 until at least three years after the establishment of the RIAI as the registration body under section 10.

          <p eId="para_186">In the interest of brevity I shall not repeat the arguments I have made elsewhere but this amendment is tabled at the request of a group of people who feel exposed and vulnerable because they may not have the necessary formal academic training certificates or qualifications but have a lifetime of experience which, in some cases, may be more valuable than theoretical academic work.  They fear that if they are to be assessed further in the process of the administration of this legislation when it becomes law, that training would be deemed by some assessors to be training that took place in a classroom or under the umbrella of a course or institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The grandfather clause here explicitly proposes to mean "as an architect based on training acquired by practical means".  This group exists, is earning its living and will not be replicated so this amendment does not leave a door open for a new generation of people to come in by the same means because registration will cover those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this seriously.  It is a definition clause that applies later.  I have been through the Bill with my legal advisers and believe this clause will provide considerable comfort for people who do not know whether they will be able to come through the process of registration.  They have fears for their livelihood that nobody else shares.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">To refuse this would verge on being unconstitutional, because a group might find its lifetime's experience and livelihood affected, through no fault of its own but because of a technical adjudication by somebody more academically orientated.  It is deliberately phrased as a grandfather clause because it will tidy itself up, so to speak.  That may not be an elegant phrase but the Minister of State knows what I am trying to say.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_190">This is an important issue.  The Bill concerns qualification and people who are deemed to be architects and practising as such.  I have received representations from the Group of Independent Architects in Ireland, GIAI, which, with the Architects and Surveyors Institute, ASI, the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, IAAS, and the Irish Architects Society, IAS, has contributed to a document entitled A Framework for Registration for the Architectural Profession in Ireland, the "framework document":</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_191">That document indicated that in any new regime, or in the event of the regulation of the profession, a grandfather approach would be taken to persons who were practicing as architects, without having formally qualified as such. That document also outlined the method of assessment to be applied to persons falling within the grandfather category which would enable them to register as an architect, based on training acquired by practical means whilst also acknowledging their established right to practice, without formal qualifications.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_192">However, at variance with the approach proposed in the Framework Document the RIAI (the proposed designated Registration Body under the Building Control Bill 2005) are determined to impose a technical assessment based on Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).  The Competition Authority's Report states that, the RIAI will face a clear potential conflict of interest between representing the interest of its members on the one hand and regulating in the public interest on the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I have tabled amendment No. 9 in an effort to resolve this "potential conflict":</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_194">RPL requires a candidate to demonstrate an achievement of learning outcomes, and is not based on experience per se, therefore it is entirely inappropriate, and against the spirit of the Framework Document that such an approach should be used to assess those people who fall within the grandfather clause as described above... The GIAI have serious reservations with regard to this assessment system being used for the purpose of assessing ‘Grandfathers' under Technical Assessment.  This grandfather group is de-facto a mature group, currently in practice, the majority of whom run their own practice with employees, and the assessment process should reflect this group's status as a finite grandfather group.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_195">In addition, the GIAI submit that the application of this assessment system is entirely inappropriate on the grounds that it is neither equitable nor consistent with the assessment procedures adopted by the Department of Environment when previously assessing those persons who are now on what is known as "the Minister's List" and which category of person is referred to in Section 12(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">This is a serious issue for this group.  While I accept that the aim of the legislation is to ensure there are no cowboys in this field and that no one sticks the title architect, planner or whatever outside his or her door as has happened.  People often come to me for advice as to whom they should approach on planning and related matters.  I tell them to ensure that the qualification or name written on the door is recognised professionally.  The GIAI properly represents people who have the expertise, skill and knowledge.  They have the qualifications and I believe their concerns are reasonable.  I will press this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_197">The effect of these amendments would be to label the registration procedure under sections 19 and 20 as the "grandfather clause".  The procedure is set out clearly in those sections and there is no reason to add to it with this amendment giving it a formal title.  The procedure for architects applying for registration on the basis of training acquired by practical means is set down in section 20.  It will be the function of the technical assessment board to provide for the assessment of such applicants.  The RIAI will not set the standards.  The board appointed by the Minister will set them.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Amendment No. 63 would require the technical assessment board, in assessing whether a person has the competencies specified in article 46 of the 2005 directive, to have due regard to the skills acquired through practical means and, where applicable, through formal training.  This is already provided for in section 20(7).  The amendment does not add to the section but might only cause confusion.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">The attitude of the Minister and the Department is unnecessarily rigid in this case.  It will not mess up the legislation but will provide comfort for citizens who have been earning their livelihoods in the State and paying their taxes.  I have heard no convincing argument from the Government as to why this belt and braces cannot be included.  None of us knows what the nature of a technical assessment might be in terms of the attitude people will have to certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I support the Bill.  However, we are trying to acknowledge that some people have acquired skills by virtue of their experience and practice and not through formal training.  By definition such people will not be here in the next generation because we have provided for a good education system in the area of building construction, architecture, surveying and so forth.  This is an attempt to lift standards in the Republic, while at the same time recognising citizens who, perhaps through no fault of theirs, were unable for economic and social reasons to get the type of education they would have wished to get.  These people have asked Deputy O'Dowd and I to provide that comfort for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Notwithstanding what the Minister said, this group of people clearly believes they are not being helped by this Bill.  As they told me in the letter, the document entitled A Framework for Registration for the Architectural Profession in Ireland states in section 6.5 that the RIAI will propose an assessment system which will provide for the acknowledgement of an established right to practise for those without formal qualifications using uniform, fair and open procedures.  Their strong view is that while the thrust of the term "grandfather clause" is widely known, it is important the specific meaning of the term is spelt out in the Bill.  It is not spelt out, so I intend to press the amendment.</p>

Section 20 deals with people with practical experience, but that does not presume or assume that an academic qualification is necessary.

          <p eId="para_309">This amendment becomes necessary following amendments made on Committee Stage that added the term "poor professional performance" to the scope of behaviour to be regulated by the professional conduct committee.  Before the Committee Stage amendment, the scope of the section was confined to professional misconduct.  It is now necessary to add this term in section 24 so that in any hearing of an appeal before the High Court, the evidence of any person of standing in the architectural profession may be admitted on what constitutes poor professional performance, as is the case with professional misconduct.  The two terms are defined in section 2, which deals with interpretation.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">Regarding amendment No. 11, the important key words are "professional" and "competence".  From that perspective, we must ensure that those working in the trade are extremely professional, and the same goes for competence.  I would say that generally, regarding doctors and teachers as well as architects.  We must have certain standards in such situations.  On amendment No. 11, I urge those directly involved in planning and development to listen extremely carefully to disability groups such as the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, and the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, when they produce sensible proposals on the Building Control Bill 2005.  I urge the Minister to pay great attention.  I have been asked to raise this by Deputy Harkin, MEP, and Deputy McHugh, who strongly support the IWA and the DFI on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">On amendment No. 11, when one speaks of poor professional performance on the part of a registered professional, one means any failure on his or her part to meet standards of competence that may be reasonably expected of registered professionals practising the profession concerned.  What we mean is competence and standards in the profession, and I welcome the amendment.</p>

What constitutes poor professional performance?  We have encountered architects who have insisted on speaking to one at one's house, after which one is billed for an on-site meeting.  As with all professions, it should be very clear to the customer exactly what it is involved, what one is getting, and what one will be charged for.  That is true of the legal and every other profession.  I ask that it be made clear to customers, all of us who avail ourselves of such services.  There should be a stronger definition.</p>

Detailed guidance on how to comply with the Part M requirement would be set out in a new technical guidance document to be drawn up by my Department.

Such dwellings must be constructed to the highest possible standard.  Alarm systems should be part and parcel of the building regulations, so that local authorities or others erecting such houses would have to install them.  While this can only apply to OPDs specifically designated in the planning permission, the Minister of State should expressly consider the issue.  In addition, he should examine the provision of suitable dwellings for the disabled.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_350">The amendment proposes that public consultation should take place before construction commences on all major public developments.  Ireland's planning system is one of the most open and transparent in Europe.  Members of the public are already afforded significant consultation rights under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-06, and more specifically under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Most State developments require planning permission and those that do not are subject to an alternative public consultation process.  Local authorities' developments are also to be subject to public consultation and therefore I see no need for a further public consultation process under this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Amendment No. 17 proposes that an access statement be submitted along with the planning application.  While I understand the Deputy's intention, I am unable to accept this amendment.  The model followed is that for fire safety certificates.  It would complicate the planning system too much to require that access statements — and, by extension, fire safety certificate applications — be included as part of a planning application.  A developer is required to obtain all three.  The various disciplines required for the effective operation of each of the different regulatory codes are quite distinct.  Therefore I think Deputy O'Dowd's amendment, in trying to improve the synergies between both codes, could compromise that effectiveness.  We should continue to allow the relevant expertise on either side to continue to optimise their resources.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is very difficult for disabled people to get in there.  I am not talking just about physical access to buildings, but also the urban environment in towns, including footpaths, which may not be properly structured for the disabled.  There are very few towns or buildings with adequate access for people with disabilities.  For the most part, they cannot get around in their wheelchairs independently.  This is a major issue but the Minister of State is not doing enough about it.  We should seek the views of organisations representing the disabled and they should have a statutory right of access.  I accept what he has said about changing the regulations but I am still deeply concerned about this issue.  I will push this amendment to a voice vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">This subsection provides for the introduction of a disability access certificate for access to a building.  The building control authority would grant such a certificate if, in its opinion, the design of the building as submitted was in compliance with the relevant requirements of the building regulations, which is Part M — access for people with disabilities.  This amendment would require a certificate for access to and use of a building.  I do not believe the amendment is necessary.  Part M(1) of the regulations already requires that adequate provisions shall be made to enable people with disabilities to safely and independently access and use a building.  The building control authority would certify this.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment as I do not consider it necessary in the circumstances as outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">I disagree with the Minister of State over the word "adequate".  It is a subjective word because who is to say that something is adequate?  The disability organisations have a clear view that the legislation is not adequate in this regard and they have serious ongoing concerns about it.  One way around this issue is to have advocates for disability with regard to all such plans.  The amendment seeks that due consideration should be given to include third party consultation on all major public developments.  This is a broad issue and the people who would advocate on behalf of the disabled should be consulted as part of the process as a right.  Many people, including ourselves, make decisions relating to disability and we should be required to consult advocates, though I know it is not possible to write to the disability federations for their views in every case.  Every local authority should have disability officers who would have an input in these issues and would be sole advocates for disabled and elderly people who have the same capacity as all of us.  The use of the word adequate is what concerns me.</p>

We have higher standards than elsewhere in the European Union and this has something to do with our experience of the Stardust fire.  A fire safety certificate is a requirement for any alteration and any new building.  I see that the Minister of State is nodding in agreement and hope he will accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The same applies to disability access.  I hosted a colleague from the Belgian Green Party recently and he felt that the level of access to this building for the disabled, particularly Leinster House 2000, is not bad.  Elsewhere in the city there were difficulties and we have a great deal of catching up to do.  If we want equality we must start with our buildings.  So much of what can be achieved in this regard is contained in this type of legislation.  It is important that we do not ignore the issue, that we start with the basics and I ask the Minister of State, on principle, to accept these amendments.

It may be argued that this is a case of belt and braces but this is a reasonable amendment in terms of the issues we are addressing and I am curious to know whether the local authorities have expressed an opinion on this and its implications.  My amendment is constructive, it is a public safeguard, it seeks an intervention by the administration on the public side, rather than self certification on the other side and I urge the Minister of State to consider it.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_373">Deputy Cuffe's amendment refers to section 4(<i>c</i>) and this subsection provides for the prohibition of the opening, operation or occupation of a building that has not got a fire safety certificate, a disability access certificate, a revised certificate of either kind or a regularisation certificate if required or where any of the certificates are the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála that has yet to be determined.  Deputy Cuffe’s amendment substitutes “and” for “or” so that the section would read “which has not a fire safety certificate and disability access certificate”. </p>
          <p eId="para_374">Deputy Cuffe requested clarification on Committee Stage as to whether the use of the word "or" could be defined as meaning "and" in this subsection.  I have sought clarification on this from the Parliamentary Counsel and am advised that in this instance the word could mean either "or" or "and" or both as required in the circumstances.  I hope Deputy Gormley can accept that this amendment is unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Deputy Quinn's amendment would require local building control authorities to inspect all completed buildings and certify that they comply with parts A to M of the building regulations.  Local building control authorities simply do not have the manpower resources to operate such a system.  The primary onus for ensuring compliance with building regulations should rest on the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  This is why I favour a close look at the recommendations for the introduction of a system of self certification by designers and builders as suggested in a working party report by the main building professionals' organisations.  I have already committed to examining the feasibility of such a system once the building control Bill is enacted.  I regret that I cannot accept this amendment in the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">These are good amendments and I support them.  I raised a key issue on Second and Committee Stages that fire safety officers have made the point that a significant number of local authorities have not inspected many of the buildings in Ireland for fire safety or method of construction.  There is a serious concern that this situation could lead to a tragedy.  There may be apartment buildings that have not been built to any standards and the local authority may be satisfied with this.  These amendments will create a greater degree of action on these issues.  The Minister of State is talking about self regulation and, while I do not doubt the professional integrity of those involved, we have buildings that do not meet fire safety regulations and for which a fire safety certificate has never even been sought.  This is a serious situation and we must ensure it is addressed in this legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_379">I am aware of the conclusions of the working party to which the Minister of State refers.  Given the balance of obligations and rights, the application of resources and the need to operate society efficiently, self-regulation has many attractions.  It will only work, however, if it is accompanied by sanctions, as is the case with self-regulation in the taxation system.  Prior to the reform of our taxation system, the heavy level of scrutiny employed was found to be bureaucratic and frequently inaccurate.  While I welcome in principle the idea of self-regulation and the capacity of professional regulatory bodies to remove the title of architect or surveyor if deliberate malpractice is found, the edifice will only come together if the sum is greater than the individual parts.  This will require a commitment on the part of local authorities or a building inspectorate to allocate resources to ensure a random sample of perhaps 5% of all works is inspected.  The proportion does not have to be large.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">If it is found that a professional has signed off on a certificate which is blatantly dishonest and has placed members of the public at risk, disciplinary action should automatically follow.  Such an approach would protect the 98% of professionals who must charge for the provision of these types of services and thereby run the risk of being undercut by cowboys who continue to operate because a scrutiny system is not in place to identify them.  I ask the Minister of State to agree to examine this matter on the basis of the working party recommendations and to establish some type of inspectorate.  I will leave it to the Department, resources permitting, to decide on the most appropriate form.  Self-regulation will not work without sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">The Bill, as published, provided that building control authorities could apply to the High Court in regard to certain enforcement matters.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, promised Deputy Quinn on Committee Stage that he would give careful consideration to the latter's amendment to provide for the right of application by a building control authority under section 12 of the Building Control Act 1990 to the Circuit Court in addition to the High Court for an order for the removal, alteration or discontinuance of work, restricting or prohibiting the use of a building or the making safe of a building where there is a health and safety risk to the public arising from the works carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Careful consideration was given to the amendment.  I agree there is a merit in a building authority having the option to choose whether to go to the High Court or Circuit Court.  Application to the Circuit Court would be less expensive for the authority.  I am pleased to include this provision in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Section 8 of the Bill was amended on Committee Stage to provide for an amendment to section 12 of the Building Control Act 1990 by providing for applications to the High Court by a building control authority where works have been commenced or completed without a fire safety certificate, disability access certificate or regularisation certificate, where such certificate is required, or where there has not been compliance with an enforcement notice, for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of the building until such certificates are granted.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_440">The fines that apply under the building code are being substantially increased under the terms of this Bill, from €800 to €5,000 and from €10,000 to €25,000, for example.  While the level of fines a court can impose is an important signal, it is probably better to ensure, through enforcement, that cases do not go to court.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The major deterrent under this Bill is the fact that a building cannot be occupied unless it has a fire safety certificate, disability access certificate or necessary revised certificates.  This provision has serious economic implications for the developer or owner of a property because it means the building cannot have a beneficial economic use.  The enforcement powers of the building control authorities will be strengthened under this Bill.  They will be empowered to initiate all proceedings for offences under the building code by way of summary prosecution in the District Court.  This should also act as a deterrent to those contemplating non-compliance with the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">While I understand the motivation behind the Deputy's proposed increase in the penalties, I consider the current levels appropriate, especially when taken in conjunction with other provisions of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">The Minister is saying he does not agree with my proposal to increase the penalties and that there are other mechanisms that are equally punitive.  I disagree with him in this regard.  A clear declaration of intent must be made that those who are convicted will be penalised effectively.  Under the planning legislation, for example, cases can go on forever and the fines ultimately imposed are not a serious issue for those on whom they are imposed.  The inadequacy of penalties is a problem in many areas.  When Drogheda grammar school was illegally demolished in 1987, for instance, the maximum fine for demolition of a listed building at that time was £10,000.  As a result of legal action I and another person took, this penalty was increased legislatively to more than £1 million.  Substantial penalties must be in place so that people will not even consider contravening the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">I strongly support Deputy O'Dowd's amendment No. 33.  There is a broader issue here in terms of the prevalence of legislation that is focused on the concerns of developers.  I am strongly of the view that we must focus in our legislation on the needs of citizens, particularly those with disabilities.  From my discussions with the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland,  I am sure they would strongly support the proposal that fines of €800 should be increased to €25,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">We must ensure the rights of people with disabilities are respected in all legislation.  It is important to be people-focused rather than facilitating the concerns of developers.  I urge the Minister of State to listen to the concerns of groups who will be affected by the provisions of the Bill.  Amendment No. 33 adds teeth to the punitive regime for those who breach the buildings regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">In regard to enforcement, on average, only 17 cases of non-compliance with the buildings regulations are taken to court by the enforcement authorities on an annual basis.  I understand the costs involved in pursuing cases of non-compliance are funded from the relevant control authority's annual budget.  Many authorities are reluctant to pursue investigations where there is an uncertain cost element or a definite cost to themselves.  Enforcement is more likely to be undertaken if it is self-financing and the costs can be recovered.  To achieve a more positive and proactive policing of the building regulations by the enforcement authorities, the cost of investigating and following through with prosecutions should be paid by the person who is non-compliant.  These are the issues raised by those who work in the disability sector.  I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 33 because this provision needs to be stronger.</p>

Given inflationary costs and the increases in property values, the potential gain of someone who breaks the law or who does not comply with it is substantial.  I understand these would be the maximum fines the court could impose so there would be discretion for judges to take account of the circumstances of the breach.  If it was done wilfully, the maximum could be applied but if it was done accidentally, it would be different.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I invite the Minister of State to accept Deputy O'Dowd's amendments or to go even further because they are fairly modest.  The amount involved is probably just a single morning's takings in the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races.</p>

The national qualifications framework is developed and maintained by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland which was established in 2001 under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.  The national qualifications framework sets out the qualifications in the Irish educational system in a clear structure so that they can be measured and related to each other in a coherent way.  Under the framework it is necessary to distinguish between the qualifications awarded prior to 2005 and those from 2005 onwards.

Based on the Bill as passed on Committee Stage, this experience would be measured from the passing of the Act.

Section 12(2) permits an architectural graduate of the NUI or the Dublin Institute of Technology or any other prescribed education institute to seek an exemption from a professional practice examination where that person can demonstrate that he or she has seven years postgraduate experience commensurate with the duties of an architect.  Amendment No. 44 would delete the provision where a person can comply with this exemption by making a statutory declaration that he or she has the requisite experience.  If this subsection is deleted, the provision on the exemption continues but the right of the registration body to accept a statutory declaration as compliance no longer exists.  It seems to me that the registration body should have the option of accepting a statutory declaration.  As drafted it is not a mandatory provision.

          <p eId="para_552">Section 14(4) enables the architects admissions board to set up an interview at which at least four members of the board would be present.  As there will be only three architects on the board, at least one member of an interview board will have to be a non-architect.  Amendment No. 50 would require at least two members of an interview board to be other than architects, which is a tying of the hands of the admissions board.  I am reluctant to undertake that step.  Perhaps the Deputy will reconsider the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Section 19(2) provides that the technical assessment board shall consist of three architects nominated by the registration body and four persons, nominated by the Minister, who are not architects.  Amendment No. 50, if made, would require that two of the three architects be in practice.  As I said in respect of amendment No. 5, the proposed provisions would serve to restrict the flexibility of the registration board.  It might prove difficult to get two architects in practice to be members, whereas there may be no difficulty in appointing architects who have recently retired or work in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I understand the background to the proposed amendment.  While it is important to ensure that members of the assessment board are informed of latest best practice, nomination of suitable architects may safely be left to the registration board.  I ask Deputy Quinn to withdraw his amendment on that basis.</p>

Subsection (3) already achieves much of what the amendment proposes to do.  One of the main objectives of the registration of architects is to give greater protection to consumers.

In effect, the times set out are somewhat arbitrary and we do not know the full extent of the details.  We have seen what happened with An Bord Pleanála which, although it is supposed to give decisions within a fixed period, cannot always do so.  I accept the spirit of what the Minister of State outlined.

Someone who is earning his or her livelihood as a solicitor or barrister can participate in this, but the tendency may be to have retired people fulfil this function.  Former judges are acceptable because they are used to adjudicating.  In an appeal process, where one faces the threat of losing a licence to work, one may end up in court as a consequence.  We must have people from the first division.  The inclusion of "practising" is a loose definition.  This is a serious process and if one loses an appeal to hold an operating licence the next step will be the courts.  We should ensure the appeal process is rigorous in respect of current law rather than the law when the solicitor or barrister retired.  This general point refers to all these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">The Bill provides that appeals may be made to the appeals board and the High Court within three months of the decision.  Originally a two month period had been envisaged.  These amendments would allow the appeals board and the High Court to extend the period.  It is important matters be brought to a conclusion in a timely manner.  These limits are in the interests of the person aggrieved at a decision and the wider public.  The effect of one of the amendments made is that a person can continue to use the title of architect, for example, while an appeal is in progress.  It is in the interests of consumers that matters be dealt with in a timely manner.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I am very pleased to present this Bill to the House.  The Defence Forces are a fundamental pillar of a democratic society.  Every member of our Defence Forces has volunteered to serve the State.  They also undertake to obey all lawful orders issued to them and to submit to the unique code of discipline, which is an essential part of military life.  From time to time we ask them to undertake dangerous and difficult missions on our behalf, both within the State and while engaged in peace support or humanitarian missions abroad.  Over many years the Defence Forces have rightly earned the very high respect and regard of the people of Ireland.  Around the world Irish military personnel are widely admired for their outstanding commitment and professionalism.  Our Defence Forces are highly trained and well equipped.  Military personnel have consistently shown the highest standards of courage and discipline in responding to the call of duty.  The ability of the Defence Forces to continue to maintain this high standard demanded of them requires complete clarity with regard to the exercise of command authority whether at home or abroad.  For challenges and dangerous missions to succeed, the chain of command must be clear and unambiguous at all times.  This is critical to the maintenance of unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Discipline is of the essence in a military force.  Commanding officers are responsible for discipline within their units.  They exercise authority primarily through leadership and by inspiring the confidence, loyalty and trust of their subordinates.  Officers and non-commissioned officers receive a world class military education which emphasises leadership, teamwork and a sense of responsibility for the welfare of the individual soldier.  As a result there is a very high standard of discipline and offences are rare.  The Defence Forces must, however, also have the ultimate power to enforce discipline through their own unique code of discipline within the Irish military justice system.  The disciplinary code must support operational effectiveness.  It must be efficient and effective.  Above all, it must be fair to the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The primary purpose of this Bill is to modernise the code of discipline by amending and updating the provisions of Part V of the Defence Acts, having due regard to prevailing human rights norms.  The Bill provides for new structures, scope, procedures, punishments and appeal processes governing both summary investigations and courts martial.  New measures in the Bill include the establishment of an independent military prosecuting authority and an independent military judicial office, the appointment of a court martial administrator, the establishment of a new summary court martial, and the restructuring of general and limited courts martial.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">In modernising the disciplinary provisions of the Defence Act, regard was had to recent developments in the military law of other common law jurisdictions and in the ordinary criminal law.  Most important, it is necessary to ensure the Irish military disciplinary system is fully compliant with modern European and domestic human rights norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Part V of the Defence Act 1954 provides for disciplinary procedures under military law for members of the Defence Forces.  Apart from the establishment in 1983 of the Courts Martial Appeal Court, the introduction of a legal aid scheme and some updating of punishments for breaches of military law, the system has remained largely unchanged since then.  During the past 50 years, however, there have been several important developments which potentially impact on military law and disciplinary procedures.  These include case law decisions of the Irish Courts Martial Appeal Court; various important statutory developments and case law decisions in Irish criminal law; case law decisions emanating from the European Court of Human Rights, particularly those in respect of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights; and significant developments in the military justice systems of other common law jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The European Court of Human Rights has benchmarked the independence of military courts by reference to a number of key indicators, including the mode of appointment and terms of office of the court members, protections provided against external influence and the provision of a manifest appearance of independence.  Furthermore, it has stated that in order to satisfy an impartiality requirement, military courts must be subjectively free of prejudice or bias and must provide sufficient objective guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this matter.  As a consequence of these developments, in July 2001 the military authorities established a military law review board to review the adequacy, effectiveness and fairness of the military justice system as laid down in Part V of the Defence Act.  Particular regard was had to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights as they related to the administration of military justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The military law review board reported to the military authorities in April 2002.  It recommended the amendment of some 76, out of the total of 134, sections within Part V of the Act.  The recommendations were fully approved by the Office of the Attorney General in July 2003.  The Office of the Attorney General recommended incorporation of the recommendations by appropriate amendment of the Defence Act 1954.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Ireland is an original party to the European Convention on Human Rights since it came into force in 1953 and the convention has been incorporated into Irish law by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, with effect from 31 December 2003.  Therefore, since 2003, there is an explicit obligation upon every organ of State to operate in a manner compatible with the convention.  Rights under the convention can be pursued primarily and directly before domestic Irish courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Pending the introduction of this Bill, non-statutory interim measures have been implemented with regard to the summary investigation of offences and the conduct of courts martial under the Defence Act.  These measures were designed substantially to satisfy the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the conduct of military legal proceedings.  It is now proposed, however, to put in place a comprehensive range of proactive statutory provisions, which are aimed to meet with, or exceed, international best practice and human rights norms in this regard.  This Bill contains many new arrangements and procedures to achieve that objective.  The members of our Defence Forces who serve our State so loyally both at home and abroad deserve nothing less than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Since the report of the military law review board was submitted, a number of legal challenges to the old system have been taken to the High Court.  I will not refer to any of those cases other than to say they will take their course in the normal way.  I believe, however, that the measures proposed will address any concerns which have been raised by serving personnel in recent times.  I also believe the measures contained in this Bill will be welcomed by all members of the Defence Forces and will ensure that the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act relating to summary procedures and courts martial comply fully with best practice and human rights norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The general scheme of the Bill, as approved in June 2005, contained 141 heads.  However, due to the importance of bringing forward modernising legislation as soon as possible, and the complexity and extent of the proposed legislation, it was decided to focus initially on the more urgent amendments to the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act relating to summary procedures and courts martial.  A number of other less urgent amendments, which are relatively straightforward, have also been included.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">I do not intend to detail at this time the remaining proposals to amend the Act, which were in the general scheme but which are not included in this Bill.  However, I believe they will, in due course, contribute to the further improvement of the Irish military justice system.  These further proposals are complex in nature and are not yet ready for inclusion in the Bill.  Instead it is proposed to include them in a separate Bill at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The provisions of the 1954 Act were largely influenced by the Canadian and British systems then in place.  The approach taken in this Bill is one of what best suits the Irish Defence Forces' needs and resources, having due regard to current human rights norms and other common law jurisdictions and systems.  A comparative study of the Canadian, British, Australian and other common law systems, as well as careful consideration of human rights norms and the ordinary criminal justice system in Ireland, influenced the formulation of the present proposals, which in some aspects will be unique to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The primary focus of the Bill is to overhaul radically the procedures for the summary disposal or trial by court martial of offences against military law.  The amendments are extensive and time does not permit me to explain every provision in detail.  Therefore, I will focus only on the main provisions.  Sections 12 and 14 provide for the revision of the time limits for the bringing of prosecutions.  The time limit for bringing of a charge against a person who has left the Defence Forces is extended from three to six months.  For serious offences, the current three year time limit will be increased to six years.  For minor disciplinary offences, dealt with summarily, the time limit will be reduced from three years to one year.  Time limits for trial by court martial will not apply to civil offences committed while serving outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Section 13 amends the existing law with regard to a very limited range of circumstances in which a civilian may be subject to military law.  I propose to extend to them the option of being dealt with summarily, with a right of appeal to a summary court martial.  By being dealt with summarily, they are exposed to the possibility of a lesser punishment, which cannot include a custodial sentence.  Sections 15 to 19 make necessary amendments to five of the offences against military law provided for in the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Section 20 provides for the scheduling of offences of a disciplinary nature which can be dealt with summarily by an authorised, commanding or subordinate officer, as appropriate.  These offences are in respect of matters which, although vital to the maintenance of discipline in the military context, are considered suitable for summary disposal.  The summary disposal of the potentially more serious disciplinary offences requires the prior consent of the Director of Military Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Sections 22 to 30, inclusive, make extensive amendments to the existing law dealing with the investigation and summary disposal of charges against officers by authorised officers, against men by commanding officers and against privates and seamen by subordinate officers respectively.  The aim of the summary procedure is to deal fairly and swiftly with minor disciplinary infractions within the unit and to return the member to normal service as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The more important measures in sections 22 to 30 include a person charged with an offence will have a right to at least 24 hours written notice of the date, time and place at which the charge is to be investigated, a copy of the charge sheet, a list of witnesses and a copy of any available evidence; in every case a person charged with an offence will have a right to elect for trial by court martial at the outset and an opportunity to obtain legal advice, if required, in that regard; the summary disposal of charges is limited to offences which are disciplinary rather than criminal in nature, that is, scheduled offences; a person charged with an offence, which is being dealt with summarily, will have a right to have an "assisting person" present at the investigation; the commanding officer's power to award detention will be abolished; where a charge is dealt with summarily by an authorised or commanding officer, there will be an absolute right of appeal to a new summary court martial, against the determination and-or the punishment awarded; and where a person is remanded for trial by court martial the case will be referred to the Director of Military Prosecutions for his directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Section 32 provides for the appointment of a court martial administrator.  His function will be the management and control of the administration and business of courts martial, the convening of courts martial on the direction of the Director of Military Prosecutions and the appointment of members of court martial boards.  He will be independent in the performance of his functions.  He will not be in the same chain of command as the person charged and he replaces the convening authority.  This provision provides a statutory basis for the current practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Section 33 provides for the establishment of an independent military prosecuting authority, to be called the Director of Military Prosecutions.  He will decide, as the Director of Public Prosecutions does in the ordinary criminal legal system, all issues relating to the prosecution of offences before courts martial.  He will have primary responsibility for the direction and conduct of prosecutions at courts martial.  Section 34 provides for the establishment of an independent military judicial office with the appointment, by an independent authority, of one or more military judges.  A military judge will have security of tenure and a judicial role similar to that of a civilian judge.  He replaces the existing judge advocate.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Section 38 provides for the establishment of a new class of court martial called the summary court martial.  It will be a permanent court, composed of a military judge sitting alone.  The summary court martial will have jurisdiction to deal with less serious cases remanded for trial by court martial, appeals from summary cases and applications for legal aid.  Sections 39 and 40 provide for the restructuring of general and limited courts martial.  These courts martial will consist of a military judge and a court martial board.  The military judge will preside over the trial, as a civilian judge does in the ordinary courts.  He will determine all legal issues and decide sentence.  He will neither be involved in nor have a vote in the deliberations of the board.  The board will make findings of fact, as a jury does, and will have no role in sentencing.  Where the accused is not an officer, a senior non-commissioned officer may be a member of the board.  Section 41 expands the list of persons who may not be members of a court martial board.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Section 42 provides for the general jurisdiction of the new summary court martial.  It also amends the existing jurisdiction for limited and general courts martial.  Specified serious offences are excluded from the jurisdiction of both the summary and limited courts martial in all circumstances.  When exercising its original jurisdiction the maximum punishment that can be awarded by the summary court martial will be six months imprisonment.  When acting as an appeal court, a summary court martial cannot award a custodial punishment or any punishment greater than that which could have been awarded at the summary investigation.  The jurisdiction of the general court martial is amended to include a case of rape or aggravated sexual assault, where the person in respect of whom the offence was committed is, or was at the time, subject to military law.  This jurisdiction is conditional on the consent of both that person and the DPP.  Sections 43 to 47, inclusive, deal with matters of procedure at courts martial.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Section 48 amends the existing law, which requires a simple majority for decisions of a court martial.  This is being changed to a new requirement of a two thirds majority of a court martial board to make a finding of guilty.  If less than two thirds of the court martial board vote for a guilty finding on any charge, the accused shall be acquitted of that charge.  Sections 50 to 52, inclusive, deal with necessary amendments to the existing provisions regarding issues as to the mental state of an accused person either at the time of the commission of an offence or at the time of trial.  Section 53 makes new provision for victim impact statements in the case of certain offences of a sexual or violent nature. Sections 54 to 56, inclusive, deal with further procedural amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Sections 57 and 58 make adjustments and additions to the scale of punishments awardable at court martial, including new monetary provisions.  The existing mandatory requirement on a court martial to sentence an officer to dismissal, when it awards him imprisonment, has been limited to situations where the term of imprisonment awarded exceeds six months.  In line with this, the term of imprisonment, above which a court martial must also sentence an enlisted person to discharge from the Defence Forces, has been reduced from two years to six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Section 60 makes new provision that a person cannot be sentenced by a court martial to imprisonment or dismissal or discharge, if that person has not had legal representation at some time after the finding of guilt and prior to sentencing.  This is a useful additional safeguard in circumstances where a person charged is represented during the trial, at his own request, by a military officer, who may not have any legal background or training.  This section also stipulates circumstances where this provision will not apply, which include where a person specifically declines to be legally represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Section 61 makes provision for the suspension by a military judge of custodial sentences, with or without conditions attached, other than in the case of a mandatory term of imprisonment.  This effectively replaces and expands the existing law, which provides for the suspension of custodial sentences, for enlisted personnel only, by a specified "superior authority", which is obviously no longer appropriate.  Section 62 makes new provision that, in certain circumstances, the Director of Military Prosecutions, similar to the DPP, can appeal unduly lenient sentences to the courts martial appeal court.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Sections 63 and 64 modify existing provisions regarding compensation orders and fines.  Sections 65 to 69, inclusive, deal with post-trial matters including the implementation of a custodial sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Section 70 modifies existing provisions relating to rules of procedure.  Section 71 provides for the establishment of a new courts martial rules committee, whose function is to make court martial rules governing the practice, pleading and procedures generally of courts martial, on a similar basis to the Circuit Court rules committee.  In the existing Act, the power to makes these rules is vested in the Minister under section 240.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The Bill contains several Schedules, which deal with such matters as transitional provisions and miscellaneous amendments to other statutes.  The Bill also provides, through the repeal of sections 215 to 222, inclusive, of the existing Act, for the abolition of the processes of confirmation, revision, mitigation and remission of the findings and sentences of courts martial.  Since the introduction of the courts martial Appeal Court, there is no requirement for the continued retention of these processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">In addition to the disciplinary type provisions described, section 8 amends section 61 of the existing Act to provide for greater flexibility in the transfer between service corps of personnel enlisted into the Permanent Defence Force after the commencement date of this section.  Under current provisions personnel who have served more than ten years in one service corps can only be transferred to another service corps in particular circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Although matters relating to discipline are outside the scope of the representative functions of the associations, both RACO and PDFORRA have been fully briefed on the Bill's contents and have welcomed its measures.  PDFORRA stated the new right of appeal to the summary court martial is a major step forward.  The Bill was referred to the Irish Human Rights Commission and we have just today received its observations.  The commission views the main thrust of the Bill as progressive and as an important step towards affording clear and consistent protection of human rights in this area.  The commission has raised a small number of specific issues which are being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The Bill was welcomed by Senators from all sides of the House.  Several amendments were made on Committee Stage in the Seanad which have improved the Bill.  In particular, the provisions relating to the appointment of the military judge and the chief military judge benefited from amendment and reflect the status attaching to these positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I am pleased to submit this legislation, as amended by the Seanad, for the consideration of the House.  The changes to the Defence Act are both necessary and desirable in order to ensure the military law justice system is both expeditious and fair to the individual, contributes significantly to the maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces and complies with the Constitution.  Most importantly, it ensures the provisions of Part V of the Defence Acts, relating to summary procedures and courts martial, are fully compliant with prevailing human rights norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_836">This is a detailed Bill that may not excite the public's mind because it is very technical.  The Minister of State spoke of the desire to maintain the discipline of the Defence Forces.  I would prefer to see the Bill dealing with the administration of justice rather than maintaining discipline in the Defence Forces.  The Fine Gael Party supports the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">A person joining the Defence Forces is subject to the Defence Act 1954 from the moment he or she joins until the moment he or she leaves.  This subsection to the Act applies even while a person is on leave in the privacy of his or her home.  The provisions of the Defence Act are comprehensive, covering all aspects of the Defence Forces, of which discipline is only one part.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Not only is the individual subject to the Act, but the Defence Forces as a whole are a creature of statute.  The Defence Forces owe their origin and maintenance to the provisions of the Constitution and the legislation of the Oireachtas.  This overwhelming control by statute puts members of the Defence Forces in a unique position in the State, especially as a comprehensive system of justice, authorised by Article 38.4 of the Constitution, is included in the Act.  This control places a special obligation on the Government and the Oireachtas to keep the Defence Act and its ancillary legislation under review, so they can be updated as circumstances change and any anomalies or errors corrected.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Article 46 of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State granted the Oireachtas the exclusive right to regulate the raising and maintenance of armed forces, which would then be subject to Oireachtas control.  Detailed regulation of the existing forces was then defined by statute in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923.  This Act was largely based on the UK's Army Act of 1881.  The UK's Naval Discipline Act of1866 was consulted by the draftsmen of the sixth Schedule of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1940 in order to include offences relevant to the naval forces, which were, however, not established on a permanent basis until 1946.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Following independence, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 was enacted to last for only one year until a permanent Act was passed.  However, it was renewed annually, with many amendments, until 1954, thus following the procedure used by the British to comply with the Bill of Rights.  General Seán MacEoin, the then Minister for Justice, presented the Defence Bill 1949 on behalf of the coalition Government and proposed retaining annual renewal, but this was rejected in the Defence Bill 1951.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The first amending Act was introduced in 1960, enabling members of the Defence Forces to serve abroad with United Nations in "duties of a police character".  A second Act was passed while soldiers were serving in the Congo, nine having been killed in an ambush.  Other Acts amended ranks, enabled women to join the Defence Forces and altered punishments which could be awarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">In the late 1980s considerable dissatisfaction arose over levels of pay, leading eventually to Army wives standing for election to the Dáil.  An outcome was the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 which provided for the establishment of representative associations.  The Defence (Amendment) Act 1993 authorised the Defence Forces to serve with the United Nations in situations more serious than of a mere "policing" nature.  The 1998 Act provided for reorganisation at defence headquarters, the adjutant-general being re-titled the deputy chief of the defence staff (operations) and the quartermaster-general, the deputy chief of staff (support).</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Defence Act 1954 has also been amended by Acts of a general nature such as the Criminal Justice Act 1990 which abolished the death penalty.  In spite of these amendments, the Government and the Oireachtas lack the discipline for regular review which especially keeps military law in line with criminal law.  For instance, there is no provision for young members of the Defence Forces to be sent to St. Patrick's Institution instead of a sentence of imprisonment.  Young members of the Defence Forces are excluded from the benefits of the Children Act 2001 by section 272 of the principal Act, which removed any benefits that they enjoyed under the Children Act 1908, creating a clear need for an amendment to the Defence Act.  Will the Minister examine this limbo before Committee Stage?  The Fine Gael Party will soon be launching its back on track policy which will provide for more progressive rehabilitation for young offenders.  I am sure Deputy Costello will be glad to offer his support on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The Oireachtas has freedom to enact or repeal legislation, or not, as it thinks fit within the bounds of the Constitution.  However, the European Court of Human Rights is directly critical of procedures which fall within the ambit of Article 38 of the Constitution, trial of offences.  The Government should be sufficiently embarrassed to take legislative action.  The British Parliament had enacted the Armed Forces Act 1996 in order to create compatibility with the convention before Findlay <i>v.</i> United Kingdom reached the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">It could then make available to the court the legislation put in place to remedy the shortcomings of its defence legislation.  There remain strong reasons for Irish legislators to follow the general principles of British military law, the most important being the fact that both Ireland and England and Wales follow common law.  That is particularly significant when one bears in mind that the great majority of judges at the European Court of Human Rights are from civil law jurisdictions.  Additionally, members of the Irish and British Forces are full-time professional volunteers, while the armies of many European countries rely heavily on conscripts.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">There is a pressing need to legislate earlier rather than later to avoid cases going to the European Court of Human Rights, which would most likely result in embarrassment for the State.  The need to amend the Defence Act 1954 is partly owing to the adverse judgments against the United Kingdom in the European Court of Human Rights.  We have very similar systems of common and military law in this country and those judgments are directly relevant to Irish military law.  Several of the judgments have affected courts martial and two have been relevant to the powers of the commanding officer, something mentioned in the legislation.  Two very relevant cases were the Hood case of 1999 and the Thompson case of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">As the Minister of State outlined, the Bill's main purpose is to put in place procedures in line with developments that have taken place in case law decisions of the Irish Courts Martial Appeal Court, statutory developments in this country and case law decisions in Irish criminal law and the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Regarding chapter 1, while there is a great deal of detail in the legislation, much of it is very technical and administrative.  I remember that when I served in the Army, one of a young officer's great fears was having to defend someone.  The rules were archaic and cumbersome.  There was always a feeling that people going on trial, particularly at court martial, were unaware of their rights and being defended by someone without much legal experience.  Often, one was reluctant to delve into matters too much to mount a good defence, since the general feeling was that if one tried to question the authority of the prosecuting officer, the defendant could end up with a more severe sentence.  I imagine that it was so in many instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Thank God society in general has moved on from that.  One thinks of the Shot at Dawn campaign for those executed for failing to tip their caps or get up on time, or for falling asleep involuntarily.  While modern society has many ills, in many respects we have moved on a great deal, which is welcome.  That has been the genesis of this legislation, which will give rise to a fairer and more equitable system, make greater expertise available to those in difficulty and provide a more structured and permanent courts martial system for those who go on trial.  In that way, there can be a degree of consistency.  Even if one is a member of the Defence Forces, one is entitled to a certain standard of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Chapter 1 amends the time limits for bringing a charge against a person who has left the Defence Forces.  The Minister of State outlined that it will change from three months to six, while for minor offences it will be reduced from three years to one.  Sections 22 to 30, inclusive, amend the existing law dealing with the investigation and the summary disposal of charges.  I remember that if someone was due in at 8.30 a.m. and arrived at 8.35 a.m., he very often faced the rigours of the commanding officer, received detention and was fined.  In civilian life, if one comes in a few minutes late, sanctions are not so tough.  I am sure that matters have evolved in the Defence Forces too, since people cannot always be on time as they used to be owing to traffic congestion.  In civilian life, someone would be told to be on time, with very little attention paid.  One had rules and regulations that were archaic and their amendment is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Chapter 4 deals with courts martial and some 24 sections cover the establishment and conduct of courts martial.  Sections 57 to 64, inclusive, deal with punishments awarded by such courts martial, while section 60 builds in an important safeguard.  I stated that a defending officer might not have the expertise.  This section allows the defendant an opportunity between trial and the commencement of the sentence to gain access to qualified legal aid to assist him or her in the case.  That is very welcome since it addresses one of the shortfalls in the existing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Perhaps on Committee Stage certain things in the Bill will leap out.  No one contacted me or my party on the Bill.  The only person of whom I am aware is a Mr. Hoare, who wrote a dissertation on the defects in Irish military law.  Many issues that he raised in his thesis are pertinent to the Bill, which seeks to address some of them.  I agree with one point that he put forward.  I mentioned General Mac Eoin's speech in 1949, when he sought to institute an annual review of the legislation.  That was rejected in the Defence Bill 1951.  A Captain Cowan dismissed renewal as a relic of the British.  Perhaps we should examine it in the context of this legislation since we are inclined to fall behind in defence disciplinary legislation.  We could consider including a review in the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2006.  In Britain, there is a five-yearly review and that could be included through an amendment on Committee Stage.  Section 5 of the Defence Act 1954, as amended by this Bill, would then be reviewed every five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I also ask the Minister to consider the problem that may have been created by section 271 of the Children Act 2001, which leaves members of the Defence Forces aged under 18 exposed to the full rigours of the criminal law, including not only imprisonment, but also a mandatory life sentence.  That may need to be addressed on Committee Stage so that we might reconcile membership of the Defence Forces by those aged under 18 with the Children Act 2001.  We should weight any action that we take in favour of those aged under 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I thank the Minister of State for his speech.  We support the Bill, although on Committee Stage we may table some amendments, depending on the Minister's actions and other issues that may come to light in the interim.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_857">We know that he cannot be with us because he is in Lebanon, but he is there for three days and I would have thought that he might have tabled this Bill for a date on which he was in the country, meaning that he might be available in the House.  It is not that often that we have legislation on the Defence Forces.  The Minister might have made an effort to ensure that it was on the agenda when he was present.  He could have instructed us or discussed it with the Government Whip to that effect.  He has certainly not held back from making statements on his travels and we read about him every day in the newspapers.  Lebanon seems to be a new forum for major statements from the Minister for Defence.  I would have thought that this House should merit proper respect from the Minister by his attendance for this debate.  Having said that, however, I welcome the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The opening statement in the explanatory memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend and update the disciplinary provisions of Part 5 of the Defence Acts, having due regard to the prevailing human rights norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I am sure the Minister of State will agree that is a straightforward and simple statement of the legislation's purpose.  However, the Bill's 94 pages contain pretty turgid, impenetrable and unintelligible language.  I do not know if the Minister of State has had a chance to dip into his own Government's White Paper entitled Regulating Better, which was published in January 2004.  The principles set out in that document were to inform the regulatory process for this and future Governments.  In particular, the White Paper stated that there should be improved access for citizens to the existing stock of legislation, maximum clarity and openness in the operations of the Government and public administration, and that the Government should improve the coherence of legislation through revision, restatement and repeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I contend that the Bill makes a nonsense of that White Paper which was published just three years ago.  The Bill has been drafted in a manner calculated to make the applicable provisions of the law more obscure, harder to access and therefore less coherent and intelligible.  It is designed to deprive, whether intentionally or otherwise, the ordinary citizen of access to its contents and meaning.  Only members of the legal profession will be able to interpret it.  It would be a holy and a wholesome thought if the Minister of State was to withdraw the Bill.  He should provide a copy of the White Paper to the parliamentary counsel who could then return to the drawing board to draft a Bill in accessible language, which would consolidate the existing Defence Acts.  It could also incorporate in its text the amendments the Minister of State seeks to make to this rather bloated and unintelligible Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">In his opening remarks, the Minister of State said he had further provisions in the pipeline which he intends to deal with at a later stage.  That is an optimistic statement given that it certainly will not happen in the lifetime of this Dáil.  In fact, the scenario I have outlined is unlikely to happen with this Bill either.  Nonetheless, the Minister should consult with the parliamentary counsel in the context of the Government's policy to make legislation accessible to citizens and begin work on a meaningful, legible and intelligible consolidation Bill.  Perhaps the parliamentary draftsman could be informed of the White Paper's contents <i>vis-à-vis</i> the work being undertaken on the proposed Bill.  In future, the Minister might also consider an integrated consolidation Bill on Defence Forces legislation.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing this for criminal justice legislation as well as for the liquor licensing laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">We are all proud of our Defence Forces whose members have served the country well since the 1920s.  Their role is to ensure that our sovereignty and neutrality are not infringed.  Since the late 1950s, they have undertaken a valuable peacekeeping role under the auspices of the United Nations.  At any given time, approximately 800 of our soldiers are serving with UN-mandated missions, helping to maintain the peace in a variety of the world's trouble-spots from Liberia to the Lebanon, where the Minister for Defence is currently visiting our troops.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Good quality training and leadership are the hallmarks of a committed and professional force.  A code of discipline is essential but it must be fair.  Disciplinary proceedings are essential and they, too, must be fair.  They should respect the individual as well as reflecting prevailing human rights norms.  In this respect, the Bill is most welcome.  It seeks to modernise and amend the current military administration of justice, which is somewhat wanting.  It provides for new structures and procedures, new penalties and appeal mechanisms governing summary investigation and courts martial.  It also provides for an independent military prosecuting authority and an independent military judicial office, the appointment of a courts martial administration and the establishment of a new summary court martial.  All of these steps represent welcome changes to the existing structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I have no doubt that if these new procedures had been in place in 1969, the outcome of the Dónal de Róiste case would have been radically different.  The evidence against de Róiste was second-hand and virtually non-existent.  I do not know if the Minister of State has seen it, but I would like to quote from a book by Don Mullin who has done such great work on Bloody Sunday and other issues.  It is entitled <i>Speaking Truth to Power: the Dónal de Róiste Affair</i>, and contains some information that became available via the various tortuous attempts to find out what actually happened in 1969.  The book reproduces a letter, marked “secret” and dated 1 May 1969, to the then Army Chief of Staff from Colonel M. Heffernan who was then director of intelligence.  We read all about him during the 1970 Arms Trial.  The letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_866">As you are aware, we would have preferred to develop this case more fully before moving on Roche, but in view of the extreme sensitivity of Clancy Barracks, it was felt that delay in bringing the association into the open would not have been an acceptable risk.  It has not been possible to confirm Roche's association with other members of the group, as reported by our confidential source.  We were somewhat handicapped by our inability to question directly the original source of information, although the questioning and requisitioning through a third party was reasonably satisfactory.  [That whole sentence is damning].  While an unsupported report must be viewed with reserve, it is significant that the report was accurate in its other respects and my view is that it must be considered as likely to be accurate on this count as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">That, therefore, is the level of evidence in one of the more celebrated cases.  Under some pressure, Dónal de Róiste was exhorted to confess to an unspecified crime and induced to resign his post.  His own request for a court martial was refused.  In other words, due process was not granted.  He was retired from the Army on grounds that "the retention of Lieutenant Roche in the army would involve a grave hazard to military security and the security of the State".  Thus, at every turn, due process and civil and human rights were disregarded.  It is time to leave that type of treatment well behind us.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The establishment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces in 2004 was a positive development as it provided the Defence Forces with an independent mechanism for investigating their complaints and grievances, which was long overdue.  It provides a useful corrective antidote in a system that can be quite removed from normal experience.  Unfortunately, the powers of the Ombudsman are not retrospective, although I believe they should be.  The Ombudsman should be allowed to examine the de Róiste case.  Incidentally, the Minister for Defence retains the power to request the Ombudsman to discontinue an investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Again, this smacks of political interference.  The Ombudsman should have full independence and in the spirit of human rights and due process permeating this Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kitt, might introduce an amendment to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 to effect these changes that would greatly advance these desirable principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The catalyst for this legislation was, as the Minister of State said in his address, the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly its transposition into domestic law in 2003.  It imposes more stringent requirements on the State to protect the civil and human rights of all its citizens.  It is important that these principles are enshrined in defence legislation.  The Minister referred the Bill to the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, and was awaiting its response when the Bill was debated in the Seanad.  The Minister of State received the response of the Irish Human Rights Commission today and I ask him to make it available to Deputies in its entirety rather than the cursory remarks he made on the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Bill requires gender proofing as reading it one would think the Irish Defence Forces were an exclusive bastion of masculinity.  The phraseology of the Bill is archaic and the language needs to be modernised.  It is important that the disciplinary procedures in the Army approximate as closely as possible to procedures relating to the administration of justice in the civil domain.  I am glad the Minister consulted with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, in regard to these matters and that these organisations have given their support to the provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Has the Minister had similar consultations with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA?  I understand it has been seeking access to the conciliation and arbitration scheme for some time without a positive response from the Department and Minister.  Is it the Minister's intention to exclude the Reserve Defence Force from the provisions of this legislation because they are volunteers?  The Reserve Defence Force is now being integrated into the Permanent Defence Force in a training and operational capacity.  Moreover, the Minister made an important statement in Lebanon yesterday when he proposed to recruit professionals, such as doctors and engineers, into the Reserve Defence Force and then send them on secondment to United Nations missions overseas with the regular Army for up to 12 months.  It is Government policy to give members of the Reserve Defence Force the opportunity to serve with the Permanent Defence Force overseas.  To what extent will the new status being granted to the Reserve Defence Force bring its members into contact with the new disciplinary provisions in this legislation and what are the implications in this respect?</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I believe offences of a civilian nature should be dealt with by the courts of the land.  A number of issues were raised in this regard in the Seanad and the Minister of State mentioned this in respect of section 42, which refers to manslaughter, rape and aggravated sexual assault under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990.  While the penalties will be the same as the ordinary courts, the offences are of such a nature that a military court is not the proper setting in which to deal with them.  Offences of this nature are best addressed by civilian courts rather than the courts martial system.  Such prosecutions will further extend the need for greater legal resources in the Permanent Defence Force.  The Minister of State might inform us of the strength of its legal section, the number of summary investigations and courts martial that occur each year and whether this Bill will result in further legal recruitment to the Defence Forces.  Advocates will operate on a permanent basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I urge the Minister of State to seek to emulate the initiative of his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, not only in respect of consolidation, but in respect of the introduction of the equivalent of a whistle blowing charter.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced a section of the Garda Síochána Bill 2005 that guaranteed immunity for whistle blowers in the Garda.  There are considerable similarities between the Garda and the Army.  Both are branches of the security forces, they are of a similar size in terms of personnel, they have strong codes of discipline and strong internal loyalties.  In the interests of promoting and advancing civil and human rights, provisions recognising and protecting whistle blowers should be included in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I welcome this Bill, warts and all.  I would have preferred if it had been dealt with in a different fashion with more accessible language and I believe there are a number of areas in which the nuts and bolts of the provisions need to be teased out.  I would like the Minister to consider the consolidation of Defence Acts.  I will introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I find it strange that the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, is not present in the House.  I know he is representing the State abroad but we were aware of this before the Bill was scheduled and it is strange not to have him here at the beginning, or at very least the end, of Second Stage.  I made clear my objections to the short length of Second Stage earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">This Bill is welcome, long overdue and similar to some of the other changes the Minister has introduced in response to problems within the Defence Forces.  One of the key motivations for new Defence Forces legislation came from the report of the external advisory committee on the nature and extent of harassment, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces.  This became known as the Doyle report, which was commissioned by the Minister for Defence on foot of the revelations of an earlier report by Dr. Tom Clonan into sexual harassment in the Defence Forces which was published in November 2000.  This is why we welcome the changes suggested here and the changes that have come into force following other legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Dr. Clonan's report and later Dr. Doyle's report found that while women make up only 4% of all soldiers, approximately one third of these women soldiers had suffered sexual harassment by colleagues or superior officers.  Significantly, the Doyle report found that despite the complaints procedure, many women in the Defence Forces were too afraid to report harassment or rape by their colleagues or superiors.  They believed, and some found out first-hand, that the internal complaints system could not result in the justice and redress they deserved.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Ultimately, the Government accepted the report's recommendations in full and the Minister acknowledged that under the next phase of modernisation, it would be necessary to deal with bullying and harassment which, he stated, had "no place in the Defence Forces".  A "new culture and values" were also needed, he said.  PDFORRA also accepted the report's conclusions and supported the introduction of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act.  I welcomed these developments at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Another study should be carried out to report on the impact, if any, the enactment of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act has had on bullying and harassment levels and the number of women in the Defence Forces.  If harassment and bullying were to be addressed, many more women would join the military.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The Bill creates further positive modernisation in the form of much improved provisions for disciplinary proceedings.  From a human rights perspective, good work has been done in drafting the Bill to ensure compliance and I understand the Human Rights Commission is largely satisfied with the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Nevertheless, as with all legislation, the Bill would benefit from some minor improvements.  For instance, the restriction in section 34 providing that persons from a civilian background may not be appointed military judges is unnecessary.  Persons from a civilian background could bring different views to bear and could learn and prosecute military law to the same effect as they prosecute conveyancing law, criminal law and so forth.  It is a strange restriction.  While it is possible that few practising barristers would seek appointment as military judges because military law is a different field, the restriction is unnecessary.  The appointment of independent persons or civilians as military judges to decide on military as opposed to civil matters would enhance oversight and the independence of proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">It is important that disciplinary mechanisms and procedures are fair and respect the due process rights of those who are subject to them.  The Bill moves in this direction.  Nevertheless, military courts and procedures have resulted in abuses and miscarriages of justice in the past, with grave and ongoing consequences for those affected.  For example, Dónal de Róiste has maintained his innocence for 37 years since being retired, as the decision was then described, from the Defence Forces, allegedly in the interests of the service.  In 2002, the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, decided to request a special report from the Judge Advocate General on the 1969 decision to retire Dónal de Róiste.  His decision amounted to an acknowledgement that the case warranted further investigation.  In 2005, the High Court ruled that the conduct of the Judge Advocate General's inquiry denied Mr. de Róiste fair procedures.  In light of this ruling, it is clear the case still warrants further investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Judge Advocate General's refusal to meet retired Army Commandant Patrick Walshe, a significant witness to events leading to Mr. de Róiste's dismissal, further supports the need for an investigation into the case.  Witnesses such as Mr. Walshe should be afforded a formal hearing in the context of a review of the case.  I call on the Minister to establish an independent inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 to grant Mr. de Róiste fair procedures for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Dónal de Róiste was retired 33 years before he was allowed to access the files and documents relating to his case.  In the interests of justice, an independent inquiry should be established to review the case and either confirm the decision on the basis of objective evidence or clear Mr. de Róiste.  In the long and drawn out aftermath of the case since 1969, it has emerged that the Government's advice to the President at the time was based on grounds of security.  The wider issue in this regard is the grave potential for abuse of powers linked to the use of security grounds, which arises from the virtual absence of transparency and accountability involved.  Will the Minister confirm that the Bill will ensure greater transparency and accountability when disciplinary proceedings are undertaken against a person or persons on purported grounds of security?  The legislation must ensure that courts martial do not result in cover-ups or prevent individuals from accessing relevant information for long periods, as occurred in the case of Mr. de Róiste.  Will he detail the improvements the Bill introduces in this specific area?</p>
          <p eId="para_888">I will also highlight the case of Mr. Michael Donnelly, a former military policeman from my constituency.  In the early 1970s, Mr. Donnelly was wrongly accused and discharged from the Defence Forces without proper recourse to means of defending his good name and status.  He was prevented from securing gainful employment for years afterwards as a result of the slur cast on his name and being blacklisted by the State.  He was forced to go to the High Court and Supreme Court to have his good name reinstated to some degree, although he has not yet received an apology and the authorities have still not admitted they were wrong in the case.  They engaged in a cover-up, did not follow proper procedure and involved the Garda Síochána in the case.  I urge the Minister to re-examine the case and give Mr. Donnelly the apology and respect he deserves for having his career in the Defence Forces cut short due to the failures of the system and the military authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I invite the Minister to use the opportunity provided by the Bill to introduce provisions on Committee Stage allowing for retrospective investigations by the Ombudsman, including into complaints centred on the fairness of disciplinary proceedings undertaken in the past.  I broadly welcome the Bill and hope it will be tightened up by addressing the points I have raised.  I hope proper procedures will be in place in future and the cases cited by me and other Deputies will be re-examined.  It is fair and proper that this small number of cases be examined.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_890">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006.  Before discussing the details of the legislation, I thank and commend the Defence Forces for their valuable and brave work in serving the State over many years.  I also thank them for their work on behalf of the United Nations.  As many Deputies will agree, we must commend our troops for the magnificent peacekeeping work they do on the international stage.  It is important they continue to focus on peacekeeping activities, rather than adopting any other agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Many people, including Members of the House, appear to have difficulty defending Ireland's neutrality.  However, neutrality, which I strongly support, does not mean sitting on the fence when international issues arise.  Irish troops have an excellent record in serving international peace and many have given their lives on international missions.  I oppose those who want to take the Defence Forces in a new direction in international affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">According to the explanatory memorandum, section 180 of the principal Act provides for the revision of summary awards and will no longer be required as the Bill provides for a new appeal process for such awards.  The repeal, it adds, will not apply to punishments awarded before the coming into operation of the new provisions relating to the "investigation and summary disposal of charges".</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I mentioned section 180 of the principal Act because it relates to a particular case that I and my colleague, Deputy Gregory, have highlighted for many years.  Privates Tom Kenny and Joseph Fitzpatrick were the only survivors of the Niemba massacre on 8 November 1960, where a patrol of 11 Irish peacekeepers under Lieutenant Kevin Gleeson was attacked by Baluba tribesmen.  There were several Irish casualties but Privates Kenny and Fitzpatrick survived and managed to make their way to safety.  It is of fundamental importance that we look after the interests of these soldiers.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Is the Minister of State aware that on Monday and Tuesday of this week, one of the survivors of this infamous ambush, Joseph Fitzpatrick, felt obliged to protest outside Leinster House?  Mr. Fitzpatrick seeks a medal in official recognition of his bravery.  This will clear his name, which he believes has been maligned by the Army for 47 years.  The other Niemba survivor, Mr. Kenny, also wishes the Army to clear his name.  He seeks a written apology from the Minister for Defence and a clear statement that Trooper Anthony Browne did nothing to save his life at Niemba on 8 November 1960.  We must put the record straight on this matter before it is too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Is the Minister of State aware that both Niemba massacre survivors believe a recent Army report, the Behan report, misrepresented their views and contained inaccuracies?  What steps will he take to ascertain the views of both these brave Army veterans?  As time is running out, will he find a way to grant their wishes?  Many Members feel strongly about this issue.  It is unacceptable that a veteran soldier who served his country bravely should be protesting at the gates of Leinster House.  I urge the Government to listen to the people directly involved in this event.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Chapter 3 of Part 3 relates to the investigation and summary disposal of charges, appeals to summary court martial and remands for court martial.  The late Captain James Kelly was badly treated by successive Governments.  The State turned its back on a man who did his best to serve his country and was acting on the orders of Ministers.  I encourage the Government to speak to Captain Kelly's widow, Sheila Kelly.  We should put the record straight and ensure Captain Kelly's name is cleared fully.  This issue has dragged on for many years.  This was a person who operated under orders but was shafted and hung out to dry.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned the case of Dónal de Róiste.  That is another issue that has been niggling away in the background for years.  The Government must take action in respect of all these cases where people have suffered miscarriages of justice.  These are the types of issues we must confront during the debate on this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Section 57 provides that an officer sentenced by a court martial to the new punishment of reduction of pay to any lower point on the scale may also be sentenced to a fine, severe reprimand or reprimand.  There must be effective guidelines and regulations, and the legislation must be tough enough to ensure there is good practice in the Army.  It is important that we reward and develop good practice.  People of other nationalities who come into contact with Irish soldiers, especially in the Middle East, are invariably complimentary.  They admire how Irish soldiers handle difficult situations, unlike the armies of other countries who have a different agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I encourage the Government to use Ireland's status as an independent neutral country to expand the Defence Forces in the interests of international peace.  I detest the words "EU battle group" that are now on the agenda.  There should be no such talk.  Our soldiers serve the United Nations in the interests of international peace.  They participate in famine missions, provide relief in the wake of storms and hurricanes and assist in building roads and bridges.  That is the Army I support.  The vast majority of people support this activity and any attempt to bring us in another direction will be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The argument is sometimes made that the Army needs more experience in combat and must enhance its professionalism.  Irish soldiers have extensive experience of Liberia and Beirut.  Members of my family have served and are serving in the Army and their professionalism is clear.  The Army is serving the State in a positive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Part 4 of Schedule 4 deals with amendments to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  The increased enrolment of women in the Defence Forces in recent years is welcome, but we must ensure they are treated with respect and equality.  I welcome the strong focus on human rights that is written into the legislation.  An army that respects the human rights of its members will respect the human rights of people in the wider community.  This is particularly important in regard to peacekeeping duties in international battle zones.  It is because the United States has shown no respect for human rights in its dealings with Iraq that it has lost the trust and confidence of both the Iraqi people and the international community.  That is why President Bush is isolated politically.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Ireland can take action in this regard.  We can take to the international stage as an independent neutral country with an independent foreign policy.  The Army has a crucial role in promoting the international peace agenda.  We must develop good practice in terms of our peacekeeping activities.  Whether working with Palestinian or Israeli communities, the Army should safeguard its special status as an independent force that will do its best to assist the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The primary objective of the Army must be to assist in ending conflicts.  We should not be ashamed to stand on the side of poorer countries.  I refer particularly to Latin American states that are isolated internationally.  Ireland should be proud to stand by these countries in defending their interests against the bully boys in the West with their nuclear weapons and big guns.  Ireland has more in common with poorer countries than it does with some of these elitist and aggressive Western countries, which seem obsessed with acquiring more nuclear weapons.  The money spent on weaponry could be better used to feed starving people, build houses and hospitals and assist countries whose populations live in dire poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Part 5 of Schedule 4 deals with amendments to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  Section 13 of this Act is amended to reflect the new roles of the Director of Military Prosecutions and the court martial administrator.  The intent of the existing provisions is not changed.  I welcome these amendments.  We know of cases where people have found themselves in difficult situations.  We also have a responsibility to look after soldiers, particularly those who have served in dangerous locations.  The Army and State have a duty to ensure their safety, especially any who suffer mental illness as a result of their experience in conflict situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">I welcome the Bill and the discussion it has facilitated.  I urge that something be done for Tom Kenny and Joseph Fitzpatrick.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_388">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_906">I join other Members in thanking the Defences Forces for the great work they do throughout the world, particularly at present in Lebanon and Liberia.  It is no easy task.  When we sent troops to Liberia with a UN mandate, it was a difficult decision and we were told in advance that they were entering a volatile situation.  The situation is even more volatile in Lebanon, where, as I predicted at the time, the conflict between Hizbollah and Israel is not over; there is a hiatus while they re-arm and get ready for round two.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I asked the Minister then if our troops had any contact with Hizbollah commanders.  He did not know but I hope when he returns from Lebanon he will be well briefed and know the situation on the ground.  I suspect that it will become more difficult over the coming weeks.  I wish our troops the very best because this is undoubtedly one of the most difficult missions.  The Minister also said he would review the situation as circumstances changed and they clearly have.  There is instability in the Lebanese Government, with protests in Beirut.  I hope when the Minister gets back we will get a full explanation of what is happening in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Our historical role as peacekeepers means that we have not been involved in bully boy tactics, there have been no incidents where Irish troops have been accused of abusing those they are supposed to be defending, unlike US troops, who have been responsible for countless examples of such abuse.  That is a result of a different culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">A recent example, and a major turning point in Iraq, was Abu Ghraib.  The US said the affair would be investigated and a military court undertook that duty.  There is a need for a military court where situations occur abroad because a domestic court could not deal with them, but do we get the same justice in a military court as in an ordinary court?  The suspicion exists that a lesser form of justice will be dispensed because there would an understanding of why the situation occurred.  Although what happened in Abu Ghraib is horrendous, we must understand that the troops investigated were low down in the chain of command and someone more senior gave the go ahead for their conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The classic example from Hollywood is the film "A Few Good Men" starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson.  The Nicholson character says that the army has its own rules and that he had to issue a "code red" so that someone would be bullied to get him ready for combat.  He said that is how the army operates, that it is a different form of justice.  The film made the point that people get justice within the army but the army operates by different rules.  If we can get a better standard of human rights as a result of this legislation, we will have done a good day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">There is, however, more to be done.  We require legislation for whisteblowers in the Army to let us know what is going on.  Since we have legislation to provide for such people in the Garda Síochána, we should put it in place for the Army, otherwise we are saying the Army is different.  We should see it in the same context.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">We have had serious abuses of human rights and civil liberties within the Army.  The case cited most often is that of Dónal De Róiste.  This was a travesty that scarred that man's life.  We must cast our minds back to the 1970s when there was a level of paranoia in this country that none of us wants to see again.  Undoubtedly the circumstances were peculiar, but as a result normal civil liberties were suspended and many people suffered, Dónal De Róiste being one of them.  He has still not secured justice and I add my voice to the appeals to the Minister to establish an independent inquiry.  Justice was not done on Bloody Sunday, an inquiry was set up, the British Army argued that peculiar circumstances obtained and there was a whitewash.  The subsequent investigation of the affair saw the truth emerge.  Many of these instances should be revisited, we should have the courage to go back and ask the difficult questions because there are many such questions remaining.  The Ombudsman should investigate Mr. De Róiste's case, with an independent inquiry looking into what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I spoke to someone at lunchtime who told me his daughter was in the Army.  As part of the training she was called every name under the sun.  It hard to know where training ends and bullying starts because of the culture that exists in military life.  We must re-examine Dr. Tom Clonan's report that showed there was sexual harassment of females in the Army.  I do not know if we have made any progress since then.  I have asked questions about bullying and it appears to continue.  If it is considered a necessary part of training, we will have a problem when someone brings a case to court because he could argue this should not be the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_914">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this short but important Bill that will amend and update the Defence Acts' provisions for disciplinary procedures applicable to the Defence Forces.  As someone who represents a constituency with a large Defence Forces presence, I join colleagues on all sides of the House in congratulating them on the outstanding role they have played in international peacekeeping and wish those currently involved in overseas missions every success.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">As a fundamental pillar of a democratic society, the Defence Forces are a huge influence on the country.  Having volunteered to serve the State, Defence Forces personnel must undertake to obey all lawful orders issued to them and to submit to the code of discipline applicable to all those who serve in the force.  The provisions of this Bill will serve as a safeguard against any deviation in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The professionalism of our Defence Forces has long been acknowledged internationally.  Their work in the world's trouble spots, from the Lebanon to the Congo and from Cyprus to Liberia, has been widely complimented and respected.  This service often involves dangerous and difficult work on our behalf and on behalf of the wider international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">This work is now being undertaken with the benefit of improved training, equipment and facilities.  This Government has put unprecedented funding into all areas of the Defence Forces, including, if I may be parochial, the commitment of €85 million to the Curragh, for which the Minister and the Government must be complimented.  For many years the lack of investment in facilities such as the Curragh led to difficulties in maintaining the professional standards required for a modern military service.  However, with this significant investment there is no doubt as to the strength of the Defence Forces into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">An important part of the operation of any military service is a strong code of discipline.  The Bill brings up to date the provisions of Part V of the Defence Acts.  It also provides for new procedures, scope, structures, punishment and appeal processes in the forces.  Central is the establishment of an independent military prosecuting authority, the appointment of the court martial administrator and significant changes in the establishment and operation of courts martial.  These changes will ensure that Ireland will be fully compliant with military law in other jurisdictions and in particular that Irish law will be fully compliant with European and Irish human rights provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">It is most important to have a disciplined and effective force so that the public can have full confidence in it.  In a modern society the operation of a military force is dependent on persuasion and motivation rather than orders and instructions, which were relied upon in the past.  The establishment of PDFORRA and RACO in the early 1990s has proved very successful in this regard despite the many prophets of doom who commented on their inception at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Discipline, however, is central to the operation of any army.  This discipline must be carried out by officers displaying competence and trustworthiness, thereby building the confidence, loyalty and trust of the personnel at their disposal.  In the case of the Defence Forces, the training given to our officers and non-commissioned officers is of the highest standard.  This training concentrates on leadership, teamwork and co-operation, and places the emphasis on the welfare of each individual.  As a result we have Defence Forces that are a credit to our democracy where it is a rarity to hear of any indiscipline.  However, the ultimate power of discipline must rest with the Defence Forces, and be transparent and fair to the individual involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">The fairness implied is underpinned by development in Irish and European law principally in the area of human rights law and Irish case law relating to the courts martial appeal court.  The European Convention on Human Rights, which is now fully incorporated into Irish law, requires every organ of the State to operate in a manner compatible with that convention.  I am aware that interim measures have been in place for the past two years relating to the investigation of offences and the conduct of courts martial under the existing Defence Act.  The Government is to be complimented on bringing these human rights protections to a full statutory basis.  These measures will now meet or in many cases exceed the requirement of international best practice in the area of military legal proceedings.  Measures of a high standard will be available to our highly efficient and loyal Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The Bill contains a number of changes to the language and terms used in the earlier Acts, reflecting a more modern approach to operation of military legal and disciplinary functions.  In this modern era that a significant number of our Defence Forces personnel are female means that protection — particularly in the areas of bullying and sexual harassment, as mentioned by other Members — must be robust and stringent.  Clearly when earlier Defence Acts going back to 1954 were enacted, female participation in our military was not a factor.  I welcome the enhanced protection offered to all personnel, particularly female personnel.  An ongoing challenge for the Defence Forces is to recruit even greater numbers of women into their ranks.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">I welcome the changes in time limits for bringing prosecutions, particularly those of a serious nature.  The time limit will now be six years rather than the existing three years, while the limit for a person who has left the Defence Forces has been extended from three months to six months, which will ensure greater transparency and fairness.  At the same time the time limit for minor disciplinary offences is reduced from three years to one year.  I commend the Minister on this reasonable and logical change.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Bill succeeds in pulling together a number of strands in the area of military discipline and law enforcement.  It makes the military law and justice system more efficient and fairer to the individual.  It helps to maintain a proper code of discipline across the Defence Forces and it updates existing laws to ensure their compatibility with the Constitution and human rights legislation.  The Bill complements the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which was introduced by the present Minister for Defence.  The ombudsman operates as a final point of appeal in any redress sought by a member of the Defence Forces.  Ms Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed as Ireland's first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces at the end of 2005.  Ms Marrinan-Quinn brings to her role a wealth of experience, both in her training as a barrister and from her time as insurance ombudsman.  The appointment of such an accomplished and experienced person gives weight to the position and confirms to all citizens — not just those now serving in the Defence Forces — the Government's strong commitment to the delivery of a fair and balanced set of disciplinary measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">I am aware that the representative organisations are very supportive of the role of the ombudsman and this support is very important in the execution of the role.  Their support is based on the clear impartiality of the office and I pay tribute to the role played by PDFORRA and RACO in its establishment.  It is further strengthened by not having any Department of Defence or Civil Service personnel, allowing for even greater impartiality, if that were possible.  The ombudsman may investigate any complaint by a member of the Defence Forces, not only concerning issues of bullying and harassment but also in cases where the action complained of was taken without proper authority, was based on erroneous or incomplete information or was based on incorrect administrative practice.  Only in a limited number of areas, particularly regarding security matters, will the Minister continue to act as arbiter in such disputes.  In the vast majority of cases the ombudsman will adjudicate.  This is very much to the benefit of all members of the Defence Forces and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on completing this package of measures in this vital area.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The record of the Government will compare most favourably with its predecessors in its treatment of the Defence Forces.  Major investment across the services has seen improved buildings and equipment, enhanced training, upgraded living accommodation, and better pay and conditions across the ranks.  As I was coming to the House this morning, I thought back to 1989 and the era of the Army wives campaign.  Clearly significant progress has been made since that particularly tragic period.  This record of achievement will stand the test of time and give this democracy world-class Defence Forces of which we can all rightly be proud.  Great credit is due to the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, for their commitment to delivering changes in such a short time.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  The Bill when enacted will play a very important role in maintaining unity and discipline in our Defence Forces as well as supporting the human rights of our personnel.  I have no hesitation in joining other Members in commending it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Defence" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_928">I thank all the Deputies who spoke for their constructive contributions and comments during the debate.  I will respond as best I can to the points made.  Looking back to the Order of Business this morning, I believe Deputy Rabbitte was correct to request a change in the allocation of time between the Building Control Bill and this Bill because we seem to have adequately dealt with it in the contributions made.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">Deputy Timmins spoke about a review of the Defence Act.  This Bill is the first phase of a two-part process to update the military disciplinary system and work on the second phase will begin later this year.  That phase will provide an opportunity to review the provisions included in the Bill.  The Deputy also asked about members of the Defence Forces who are under 18 and I will examine the matter in advance of Committee Stage.  He proposed a five-year review of the Bill, which we will consider in conjunction with the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Deputy Costello spoke about restatement, an ongoing issue that needs consideration.  In this case we are amending part of the 1954 Act, which is a very complex Act.  When the Bill is enacted we will prepare a restatement of the Act, which will put the amendment in context.  The provisions of the Bill have been fully explained to PDFORRA and RACO, which have indicated their satisfaction with the Bill as drafted.  After the second phase of the process, consolidation of the Act will be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The Deputy also spoke about gender neutrality and language.  The matter was raised a number of times in the Seanad, following which I have taken the advice of the office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  There are several approaches that can be taken to the amending of Acts that are not gender-proofed.  Rather than adopting a blanket approach, each instance is examined on its own merits.  It would be difficult to avoid the use of pronouns by referring to "the person" as we are amending only part of the 1954 Act.  If the words "he or she" were adopted, it would interfere with the integrity of the 1954 Act.  The matter is academic as the provisions of the 1954 Act which are unaffected by the Bill will continue to use the pronoun "he" only.  In any case, the Interpretation Act 2005 provides that a word importing the masculine gender shall be read as also importing the feminine gender.  If the 1954 Act were to be rewritten or consolidated, full gender proofing would occur and an effort made to avoid personal pronouns where possible.  The arguments in this context have been well made.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The provisions of the Bill apply to members of the Reserve while they are subject to military law.  The amendment of the Ombudsman Act suggested by Deputy Costello is outside the current scope of the Bill.  On the IHRC report, the Department received a draft copy only today.  When the report is finalised, it will be made available as a matter of course.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to the merits of appointing a uniformed, as opposed to civilian, military judge.  The issue of whether the military judge should be uniformed or civilian was considered in detail by the military law review board and at great length during the drafting of the Bill.  Existing ECHR and other relevant case law was reviewed thoroughly while regard was had to the position in other common law jurisdictions.  External senior counsel were also asked to advise on the matter.  The UK model of both full-time civilian judge advocates and continued involvement by non-legally trained military officers in the performance of judicial duties was not considered suitable for Ireland to follow.  Practicality in Ireland suggests the appointment of a uniformed military judge for numerous reasons, including the requirement for flexibility within the system and of the incumbent, the low numerical size of the Defence Forces and the anticipated volume of judicial duties to be performed.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The judge will be required to travel around Ireland and abroad, often at short notice.  Time will often be of the essence with regard to the function of the proposed military judge.  Within the military, there is a substantial body of knowledge of the peculiarities and exigencies of military service and the application of the system of military discipline and justice.  A uniformed military judge will ensure a rapid, smooth transition and acceptance of the new system.  In the final analysis, it was felt that a uniformed military judge with statutory safeguards of his or her independence and impartiality, including security of tenure, financial security and institutional independence, would best suit the needs of the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">Deputy Costello spoke of serious offences, including murder and rape, being tried by court martial and asked what punishment would apply.  Currently, the most serious offences, including treason, murder, genocide, manslaughter, rape and aggravated sexual assault, can only be tried by court martial if the offence is committed by a person on active service, which normally means overseas service where the ordinary courts do not have jurisdiction.  Punishment available to a court martial for these most serious offences are the same as those provided for in the normal criminal justice system up to and including life imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Deputy Costello also asked how many courts martial take place each year and whether the number is expected to rise under the new system.  In recent years, there have been less than 20 courts martial per year.  However, the impending changes have meant that there were none in 2006.  I expect the number of courts martial under the new arrangements to increase significantly to reach or even exceed 200.  The increase will be due mainly to the introduction of an absolute right of appeal to the new summary court martial procedure from a determination or punishment of a commanding officer.  After an initial significant increase, the numbers coming forward are likely to settle down to a rate of approximately 10% of all summary cases.  According to recent annual figures of cases for summary disposal of approximately 1,600, this should equate to an additional 160 courts martial per annum.  The abolition of detention as a punishment awardable by a commanding officer and the new right to elect for trial by court martial from the outset are also likely to lead to small increases in the number of courts martial per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">The current strength of the legal service within the Defence Forces is nine officers and it is not expected to increase significantly.  Deputy Costello asked about a whistleblower's charter, which matter has also been raised in the Seanad.  Having considered such a charter, we have determined it to be outside the scope of the current Bill.  I note, however, that a great deal of work is being carried out on the matter on a sectoral basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Deputies Gormley and Finian McGrath raised a number of cases, including the de Róiste, Kenny and Fitzpatrick cases, none of which are relevant to the proposed legislation.  I will, however, convey the strong views expressed by the Deputies to the Minister.  I suggest the Deputies make any representations on the cases directly to the Minister for Defence if they have not already doneso.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Deputy Gormley referred to the Lebanon.  I suggest strongly to the Deputy that the questions be taken up with the Minister on his return.  I agree that it is important to discuss the issue raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Deputy Gormley also spoke about bullying, which is an issue I pursued vigorously as Minister of State with responsibility for labour.  I introduced the first task force on workplace bullying which led to the introduction of a code of practice.  A great deal of work has continued to be carried out in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is being developed by my colleague, Deputy Killeen.  Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired our task force, carried out strong investigations of practices and behaviour in the Defence Forces and issued a report and recommendations which are being pursued.  Bullying is a very important issue in any workplace, but there are issues specific to the Defence Forces which fall to be addressed.  I support the continuation of work in this area.  Deputy Ó Fearghaíl made thoughtful, supportive comments on the Bill for which I thank him.  He has considerable knowledge in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">I thank Deputies for their contribution which has been most instructive and helpful.  It is intended that the Bill will reflect and further enhance the non-statutory interim measures implemented to date for the summary investigation of offences and the conduct of courts martial under the Defence Act.  The Bill represents a significant advance and a sensible, practical model for the operation of the Irish military disciplinary system for the years ahead.  The measures provided for are proactive on human rights while facilitating the effective maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces.  The House may rest assured that any amendments proposed which are fundamentally consistent with the general spirit and objectives of the published Bill will be fairly and objectively examined.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs whether he will pay all qualified adults directly;</b>
         his views on reviewing State pension contributory qualification criteria to improve the eligibility chances of older women who have returned to work following many years of homecaring duties; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [8199/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_392">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_945">A person who is in receipt of a social welfare payment may claim an increase in respect of a dependent spouse or partner.  This increase, known as qualified adult allowance, QAA, is normally paid as a single amount with the primary payment to the claimant.  Provision has existed for many years to split the payment and pay the spouse or partner separately if the recipient so wished, or in cases of difficult family circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">In recent years the question of paying the QAA direct to the adult dependant as the norm has been raised in a number of reports, the intention being to provide the dependant with a level of economic freedom.  Significant changes have been made in the social welfare code over the years to ensure that as many people as possible qualify for a social welfare payment in their own right.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">In the recent budget, I announced significant improvements in the rate of payment for qualified adults on State pensions and important changes in the way these payments will be made in future.  The changes will involve amending the existing arrangements to provide that, in the case of new claimants to the State pension schemes, the qualified adult increase will be paid directly to the qualified adult.  Customers who wish to be paid their pension jointly will continue to be facilitated.  The revised arrangements will apply to all new applicants to the State pension schemes with effect from 24 September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The position regarding payments to people of working age is less straightforward and a separate payment may not be appropriate for certain schemes.  It is open to a dependent spouse or partner to claim payments such as jobseeker's allowance in his or her own right subject to satisfying means and other conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years — from 1994 — spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged over his or her full working life for pension purposes.  Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commenced or ceased to be a homemaker.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">The homemaker's scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">A review of the homemaker's scheme and other issues relating to social welfare pensions is taking place in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions which is expected will be finalised by the end of March 2007.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy on foot of this.</p>

          <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_393">
            <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_952">I thank the Minister for his response.  He stated only new claimants will qualify automatically.  Does he have plans to extend the scheme to existing claimants?</p>
            <p eId="para_953">Does the Minister agree the impact of the marriage bar is now being felt and it is most unfair?  Prior to 1973, women employed in the public service were forced to give up their jobs and to attend to homemaking duties.  Because of that, women who are now reaching retirement age find they are without a pension in their own right.  They suffer doubly if they went back to work for a short period before they retired.  Does the Minister have a view on this situation?  Is he aware of the number of women who were affected by the marriage bar and how many women are affected by it today and does he have any plans to make changes in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_954">Does the Minister agree the averaging rule to which he referred is most unfair because it takes into account the years women spent in the home?  Does he also agree that the work carried out by the women at that time was extremely valuable?  They reared the Celtic tiger generation at home.  They had no choice in the matter.

            <p eId="para_955">I confirmed the commencement date for the revised arrangements would apply to new applicants from September 2007.  It is not proposed at this point to include existing recipients, although I would like to do so.  The Department informed me it could take some time to do that.  We will commence with new applicants and I hope in time policy will develop so we can extend this facility to existing recipients also.  I am pursuing the important policy objective that payments would be made to people in their own right.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The question of pensions cover for women who left employment as a result of the marriage bar has arisen on many occasions in recent years.  The case is often made that they were penalised at the time they left their employment and they are being further penalised for the fact they have no pension rights.  At the time, the women in question were paid a marriage gratuity and the Department of Finance has confirmed that this was considered a payment in lieu of pension rights.  That is the legal position.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">In general, the social insurance class paid by those affected by the marriage bar was a modified rate which now gives coverage for widows' and guardians' payments, occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer's benefit only.  This class of insurance reflected their occupational pension position and general contract of service at the time.  Accordingly, even if the women concerned had continued in employment, contributions made at this class would not have entitled them to a contributory pension under the social welfare scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">In the social welfare context, the arguments in this area have focused on the question of backdating the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in 1994 and which, in line with practice in regard to new schemes and changes in insurability, operate from a current date.  The issue of homemakers is being examined in the context of the Green Paper on pensions to which I referred earlier.  It should be finalised by the end of this month.</p>

        <b>Mr. Penrose</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         his views on abolishing the means test for the carer’s allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [7924/07]

          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_395" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_960">Carer's allowance is a social assistance payment paid to people who are providing full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure resources are directed to those in greatest need.  This means test has been eased significantly over the years.  Following budget 2006, the earnings disregard for a couple was set at €580 per week, which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  In budget 2007, I increased this to €640 per week for a couple from April 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">This increase means a couple with two children will be able to earn in the region of €36,000 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure exceeds the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">In addition, I have increased the rates of carer's allowance to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.  From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person in need of such care, regardless of their income.  Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker's assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment, subject to meeting the full-time care condition.  From June 2007, the level of the grant will increase by €300 to €1,500 per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">It is estimated that complete abolition of the means test for carer's allowance would cost over €140 million in a full year.  There are differing views on this, with some support organisations strongly of the view that if this level of resources were available, it would be more beneficial to carers if it were invested in further increases to carer's allowance and in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support.  As a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_966">For that reason I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area in budget 2007 under which people in receipt of certain social welfare payments, for example a widow's pension, who are providing someone with full-time care and attention will be able to retain their main payment and receive an additional payment, depending on their means, of up to a half rate carer's allowance.  I have provided for these new arrangements in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">I again reiterate my commitment to working for and with carers to deliver increased benefits, supports and services for them and their families.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_396">
            <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_968">The Minister knows the Labour Party position.  We are unequivocally committed to abolishing the means test for carers.  There are thousands of people in the country with a job that has a mandatory 365 days a year contract, with no leave, holidays or bonus.  Who are these people?  They are carers who provide unpaid help for a family member or friend with a disability.  Almost half of these carers have no paid employment and one third of them give more than 43 hours of unpaid time per week.  Less than one fifth receive financial assistance from the State for their invaluable and tireless work.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The facts speak for themselves.  There are only 150,000 carers in Ireland.  The recent report by the National Economic and Social Forum indicates that unpaid care saves the Exchequer up to €2 billion every year.  Carers are saving the State a vast amount that would arise if those people needed institutional care, without considering the capital expenditure needed to build such facilities.  It is a no-brainer.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">How much money is spent by the Department administering the means test?  Is it not an expensive process?  Savings from the abolition of the means test would be offset against the cost of a commitment the Labour Party would give to abolish the means test for carers.  Abolishing the means test is a clear way of recognising the invaluable role of carers in our community and supporting them.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">A post office at Park Road, Killarney, closed after Christmas.  Pensioner, carer and invalidity books were taken when presented at the New Street post office and people were advised that the books would be returned the following week.  Today, most of the pension books are not available and people are being sent to community welfare officers, who are not aware that all these people will be arriving.  The staff at the post office have had no communication from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">What communication has the Department of Social and Family Affairs had with the post office staff?  When will the situation be clarified for social welfare recipients?  Have the community welfare officers been given details of the people who will approach them for assistance?  The Minister may not have the answer immediately but it is important that the Department of Social and Family Affairs deals with this in its usual humane, compassionate way.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_397" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_973">If I announced the abolition of the means test for carers, the Labour Party would have to amend its manifesto.  Deputy Penrose would be the most disappointed man in the House if I announced that move.  The Deputy feels passionately about this and has managed to put the issue at centre stage in his party, on which I compliment him.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">I have an open mind on the matter.  Sometimes it is better to raise thresholds and disregards and one must choose between these measures while retaining the means test or introducing a universal carers allowance.  At some point the means test will not be worth a candle but one must be careful when drawing the line.  One must not give valuable State money through the welfare system to people who do not need it.  This will happen with a universal system.  I am aware that it costs four times as much to care for someone in residential care as it does in the person's home.  At some stage, retaining a means test will no longer make sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">I will ask the Department to examine the situation in Killarney and revert to the Deputy.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_398" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_977">In 2005, the rate of consistent poverty in Ireland was 7% of the population, of whom 12.2% were children.  This proportion is still too high, but it must be judged in the context of what has been achieved over the past decade.  Some 250,000 people, including children, have been lifted from poverty in Ireland based on the consistent poverty measure.  The Government is determined to continue to work to achieve and, as resources permit, exceed this rate of progress in reducing child poverty in the years ahead.  Budget 2007, in which I announced a range of measures costing over €240 million to benefit children and families, provides clear evidence in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">These measures include combining these rates of child dependant allowance payments in a new single high rate qualified child allowance of €22 per week that will benefit over 340,000 children of families on welfare, increasing the rate of child benefit by €10 per week, which benefits over 560,000 families in respect of approximately 1,134,000 children, increasing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by €60 and €95 and providing additional funding of €3 million in 2007 to extend the school meals programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Other budgetary measures, such as the €20 per week increase in the lowest social welfare rate to €185.80 and increases in the earnings thresholds for the one parent family payment and family income supplement, will also indirectly benefit children living in poorer households.  For the longer term, the Government recently published the national action plan for social inclusion 2007-16.  The approach, in the case of children, is designed to ensure effective co-ordination across all policy areas that support children and across all Departments and agencies responsible for implementing these policies for children by 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">For the purposes of the UNICEF report, which uses statistics relevant to the year 2000, the income threshold for the relative income poverty indicator is 50% of average household income.  As it relates just to the income a household receives, it does not include other resources a household may have or have access to which keeps them out of actual poverty.</p>

            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_983">Any reference the Minister makes to consistent poverty has nothing to do with my question.  The UN body compared 25 industrial nations and Ireland ranked 22nd.  Regardless of the direction of Government policy, and the Minister's answer admits it has been painfully slow, Ireland should not be in this position after ten years of economic growth.  The measures that need to be implemented are found in the countries that were most successful in this study.  The rate of child poverty for Ireland, the UK and the US is 15% of the population.  The Nordic equivalent, in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, is 5%.  Aside from the publication of the action plan on social inclusion the Minister should set clear targets to reduce the figure of 15% to 5% in a short time.  He has not done so to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">The study uses figures from 2000.  We should keep that in mind.</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_986">With respect to the Deputy, it has changed.  It is almost seven years since these figures were produced and Ireland has changed dramatically in that time.  While the Deputy is right to say the study places us as 22 out of 24 in regard to material well-being it puts us eighth in terms of educational well-being, seventh in family and peer relationships, fourth in behaviours and risks for children and fifth out of 21 for subjective well-being.  In almost all the other measures in the study our children come out close to the top which brings us back to the question of how we measure poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">In the recent budget we put €240 million into a range of measures, a decision the House supported because it was necessary.  For the first time since 1994 we put an extra €60 million into child dependant allowances with the result that the child benefit increase of €10 a month across the board was not the same for the one third of children on the bottom rung of that ladder.  They got an extra €22 per month.  That is the first time since 1994 that a clear preference was shown and funds were put into helping poor children, rather than making an across the board increase in child benefit which would perhaps have been politically more attractive but would not have been the right thing to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The increases in the family income supplement and in the one parent family payments have added up to a solid assault on child poverty.  I am determined to keep up that pressure and eliminate child poverty.</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_990">Consistent with the vision for all people of working age as set out in the Government's recently published national action plan for social inclusion 2007-16 and bearing in mind the 2010 EU level target participation rate for older workers of 50%, which was agreed by the European Council under the Lisbon strategy, unemployed people aged 55 to 64 years have been included within the scope of the national employment action plan since July 2006.  Those who are approaching three months on the live register are referred to FÁS for interview and access to the full range of supports available under the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The back to education allowance, BTEA, is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce.  This is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly rate instead of the relevant qualifying social welfare payment.  The eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme are considered reasonable and targeted to ensure that resources reach those most in need of support.  If a person is in receipt of BTEA prior to reaching pension age, the annual cost of education allowance, which is €400, may continue in payment beyond pension age during the remainder of the course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Since 2003, the employer PRSI exemption scheme has been aligned directly with the back to work allowance scheme.  The scheme exempts employers from their share of the PRSI contribution in respect of recipients of the back to work allowance for the first two years of employment.  Back to work allowance is payable to long-term unemployed people over 55 years who are returning to work and consequently the PRSI exemption scheme also applies to this age group.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">FÁS training programmes are open to people who are over 65 years of age.  They are not a target or priority group but they are eligible to apply and be considered for participation.  In addition, FÁS evening courses are available to people over 65 years, as are courses provided through FÁS eCollege.  To encourage and facilitate those who wish to continue in employment after pension age, the new enhanced State pension, non-contributory, for those over 66 years which I introduced at the end of September 2006, featured an employment earnings disregard incentive of €100 per week.  I was happy to enhance this incentive to €200 per week in Budget 2007.</p>

            <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_994">How successful was this income disregard for older non contributory pensioners?  Is it true that just 398, or 0.4% of non-contributory pensioners availed of the scheme?  What efforts are being made to promote the scheme?  Does FÁS operate a quota system for people over the age of 55 on their training and CE schemes?  If so, is that discriminatory?  Could the Minister examine that please and do something about it?  Is it also true that only people of working age are included in the national employment action plan and has the Minister any plans to change that?  What supports is he putting in place to facilitate older people and those over 66 years of age who wish to remain at work?</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_995">Labour force participation by people aged 65 years or over is in the region of 7.2%, and it is expected to reduce to 6.2% by 2010.  In the 1950s it was 37%.  I do not have figures for those who claimed the €100 income disregard which became €200 in the recent budget but the number is small.  There has not been an enormous response but the disregard is valuable.  We have asked the Citizens Information Board to promote it more.  As with the family income supplement, too few people are aware of it after years of the opposite being the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">If one is on a non-contributory pension one can earn €200 per week in employment without affecting one's non-contributory pension.  I wish to promote that widely so that more people take it up.  Many people are probably afraid to earn some additional income for fear that it would interfere with their pensions.  The limit is €200.  We will promote it through the Citizens Information Board.  We included people aged over 55 years in the national employment action plan which was appropriate because people over the age of 55 might need new training, education and opportunities to start second careers.  Including them in the plan is sensible.  Prior to that they were almost written off which is not the correct way to proceed.  We recently reduced the time for which one is unemployed before being referred to the national employment action plan from six months to three months to keep the pressure on that plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_998">Child benefit can be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the State.  Payment can be extended to the nineteenth birthday if the child is in education, or incapable of self-support.  The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and since 1 May 2004, the qualified person must satisfy the habitual residence condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the ten new EU member states, without the transitional limitations that were imposed at that time by most of the other member states.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.  EU regulations provide that EEA nationals who are migrant workers who are, that is, who have been employed or self-employed since coming to this country, or receiving Irish jobseeker's benefit, are entitled to payment of family benefits in respect of their families who reside in another member state.  In these circumstances the family members are treated as if they are habitually resident in Ireland for the purpose of child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">For the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 January 2007, the number of child benefit claims that required particular examination of the habitual residence condition was 16,092.  Of these, only 1,557, less than 10% were disallowed.  Those who are refused child benefit are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, who do not have a work permit or who have only a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">I am satisfied that the habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose, allowing access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1002">Does the Minister accept that child benefit is a key mechanism for ending child poverty?  Would he also accept that children who are now prevented from receiving child benefit due to the habitual residence condition are most in need of it, given that their parents are not permitted to work while awaiting a decision on their residency application?  Does the Minister acknowledge that our immigration policy is taking precedence over anti-poverty measures, with children being driven into greater poverty due to child benefit no longer being a universal payment?</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">How does the Minister respond to the charge that, while all children are equal, this Government considers some more equal than others with this blatant discrimination?  Does the Minister accept that the Government's immigration policy is in contravention of the Minister's stated policy objective of eliminating child poverty?  If a child is hungry, we should address that hunger.  However, whether it was due to media concerns that Ireland would be swamped by people from other European countries or for other reasons, we introduced the habitual residence condition with regard to people who should be entitled to this benefit.  How many people does it affect?  Does the Minister accept that families who have been denied this payment are struggling to afford warm clothes and nutritious food for their children?</p>

            <p eId="para_1004">I have met various organisations about this issue.  The Department, the Government and I wish to take a humane and caring approach to it.  As the Deputy correctly points out, children are innocent parties in these decisions to move from country to country.  We will keep a close eye on it.  Ireland was one of only three states to open its borders in 2004; most other member states did not do that.  We have led the way in welcoming and integrating immigrants, and I hope that sensible approach will continue.</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1011">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 60 and 166 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">Last year's Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of child care; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">One of the proposals in the report was that the upper income limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week.  Last year, in budget 2006, I increased the upper income limits on the one-parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week, moving a substantial way towards this limit.  In this year's budget, I completed this element of the proposal by increasing the upper income limit for the one-parent family payment to €400 per week, provision of which is contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007 currently before the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">The new social assistance payment, currently being developed by officials in my Department, will have the long-term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — the avenue that offers the best route out of poverty.  Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and agencies.  This is why the Government has instructed the senior officials group on social inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">Work on the development of this implementation plan is progressing.  Issues including access to child care support, education, training and activation measures are being discussed with the relevant Departments and agencies.  The development of legislation to introduce the new social assistance payment has been prioritised in my Department and work on this is at an advanced stage.  To further inform the process, my Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, will test the proposals in both an urban and rural setting.  These tests will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that might arise in advance of the scheme being introduced.  The tests will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and agencies to be considered and developed and will facilitate the development of the new scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">The Cabinet cleared the discussion document which we published.  We have had a number of discussions recently on my proposals.  The legislation is being prepared in the Department.  The implementation group is doing its work as we speak and I hope the tests can start this year.  The tests are to assess in an urban and rural setting how the new payment might work.  This involves removing the cohabitation regulation, abolishing the lone parent payment and replacing it with a family friendly payment for low income families.  An enormous amount of technical work must be done to ensure the schemes add up and are integrated, and that work is progressing.  I hope the legislation can be advanced as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1032">Is the Minister aware that his proposal would create new poverty traps?  Is he happy with that?  Unless the Minister deals with the question of poverty traps and child care, he can tear up the proposals.  The cohabitation rule should be scrapped.  Too many inspectors are used by the Department of Social and Family Affairs knocking on doors checking welfare recipients.  No matter how often we tell them particular situations arise, they still carry out their investigations.  Will the issues raised at Farmleigh be addressed?  We knew anyway that we would not see it this side of an election.</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1033">The Deputies know this is a complicated area.  The Government's policy is clear in that it is committed to removing the cohabitation rule, replacing the lone parent's allowance with an allowance that is targeted at children who live in low income families rather than focussing on the make-up of a family.  That principle is generally supported across the House.  We are working on the logistics because it will have implications for other schemes and supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">Lone parent groups have made it clear to me that they are only interested in this provided there is joined-up Government and that child care, educational, training and activation supports are implemented at the same time.  The implementation group has been charged with the task of ensuring these other supports are introduced in tandem.  I am confident that whoever is appointed Minister after the next election, he or she will see these reforms through.  These proposals have been examined for many years.  I did not invent them but I gave them a push.  They are grounded in good research and sensible policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1035">Will the Minister accept that low-paid jobs are not necessarily a good way for lone parents to take their families out of poverty?  Part of the problem is down to the quality of jobs they are offered.  I have been informed that lone parents under this scheme would be given priority access to county child care committees.  However, there is no system in place in prioritising these committees.  Is this part of the work to be done in the next several months?</p>

            <p eId="para_1038">We must ensure they are fully informed of this option.  As poverty is more prevalent among lone parents, they would have substantial priority in the child care area.  Other measures already exist, such as the extra €1,000 payment, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has increased the number of child care places available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">I am concerned that the quality of jobs available to lone parents needs to be improved.  Two thirds of lone parents are working but in jobs that pay a little above the minimum wage.  This is why these reforms are being introduced.  Training and educational supports will increase lone parents' skills.  With more child care provision, they will be able to come up on the employment ladder and get better quality jobs.</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1043">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 23 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The new national action plan for social inclusion was launched last week with an overall goal to make a decisive impact on consistent poverty.  This is underlined by the fact that a new target is being set, using an updated set of indicators, which is more realistic and in keeping with living standards today.  The new target is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016, under the revised definition.  The new target reflects experience and advice that it may be difficult to bring consistent poverty down to zero, due in part to the subjective and sensitive nature of the survey questions used to identify deprivation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The consistent poverty measure was developed independently by the ESRI in 1987 using indicators of deprivation based on standards of living at that time.  This measure identifies the proportion of people, from those with less than 60% of median income, who are deprived of one or more goods or services considered essential for a basic standard of living.  The target set in 2002 was to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor to 2% by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty, as then defined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">A major discontinuity between the living in Ireland survey, previously used for monitoring progress against the target, and the new EU survey on income and living conditions, introduced from 2003, means that it is not possible to compare trends in consistent poverty between the two surveys.  However, continuing low levels of unemployment and the substantial resources devoted to social welfare and other social services support the view that the downward trend in consistent poverty, from 8.3% in 1994 to 4.1% in 2001, would have continued and the target would have been reached by 2007 using the living in Ireland survey method.  The first three years of EU survey data indicate the overall consistent poverty rate reduced from 8.8% in 2003 to 7% in 2005.  Some 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, have been lifted out of deprivation since 1997 as a result of concentrated and targeted measures and supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">The Government, in setting the new poverty reduction target, has accepted the advice of the ESRI to use an updated set of deprivation indicators, which focus to a greater degree on items reflecting social inclusion and participation in society.  This will see the current measure, based on lacking one or more items from an eight-item index, changing to one based on lacking two or more items from an 11-item index.  This revised set of indicators will be used to measure consistent poverty over the course of the new NAPinclusion.  The current rate of consistent poverty using the new measure is 7.0%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">While the consistent poverty measure is the official Government approved poverty measure, other poverty measures highlight different aspects of poverty.  The at-risk-of-poverty measure is the best known and quoted as it affords some comparisons with other countries.  However, it does not measure poverty as such, but rather the proportion of people below a certain income threshold.  I have previously expressed my strong concerns regarding the use of this measure by the UN when creating its human poverty index.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">Furthermore, the UN Development Programme, in an article last year in the prominent journal, Development and Transition, restated the problems inherent in using the at-risk-of-poverty indicator for international comparisons, concluding that the results too often belie common sense — the at-risk-of-poverty label sends the wrong signal to the public and policy makers — and the risk-of-poverty logic does not lead to effective national policy.  While the latest EU-SILC results do show that our at-risk-of-poverty rates are falling, from 19.7% in 2003 to 18.5% in 2005, I continue to believe that this measure gives a misleading impression of poverty as at-risk-of-poverty levels are affected by increases in incomes generally.  I am confident that the new NAPinclusion will build on the achievements of the last decade and deliver greater social inclusion and a society in which remaining consistent poverty is finally eliminated.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_435">
            <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_1051">Is it not clear that the 1997 social inclusion programme failed?  Is it not clear that we have failed to reduce the level of consistent poverty to 2% by 2007?  The 7% figure means 300,000 people are considered as being in poverty.  Is that not the position?  Did I not argue here four years ago that the figures used by the ESRI were outdated, outmoded and in need of modernisation?  Were they retained because they showed that consistent poverty was falling, when we all knew that not to be the case outside?  Surely it is hard to argue against the UNICEF report to which Deputy Boyle referred, which ranked us 22nd out of 25 countries.  Does that not reflect what emerged when factors evaluated to assess consistent poverty were upgraded and modernised?  Is that not the problem?</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">I acknowledge that we have made progress, but it is not nearly as impressive or worthy as some have tried to portray it.  Should we not all hang our heads in shame that such a significant proportion of people remain in poverty, particularly children?  What policies does the Minister have to tackle that?  Will this part of the social partnership be addressed and ensure that the objectives set out therein are achieved?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_436" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1053">We should be conscious from the taxpayer's perspective that welfare payments have doubled in five or six  years, from €7 billion to €15 billion.  That is a considerable investment by the taxpayer in tackling poverty.  It is not only a question of income, since other Departments are also involved.  Recent budgets were to a large degree targeted at tackling child poverty, which we dealt with in earlier questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">The target of 2% that we set out in 1997 has been reached.  However, I acknowledge that it could be challenged.  I explained that the old method was the Living in Ireland survey, which in 2003 was replaced by the EU survey on income and living conditions, SILC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">Consider the continuing low levels of unemployment, the substantial resources put into doubling social welfare benefits, and the downward trend in consistent poverty.  In 2001, we were at 4%, and welfare spending has almost doubled since, not to mention the fact that we have had economic growth of 4% or 5% per annum.  The Department does not disagree with my contention that we would almost certainly have reached the figure of 2% by 2007 if we had still been using the old measure.  As we are no longer doing so, no one will really know.  If we were at 4% in 2001, I am confident that, six years later, with all the resources applied and the economic growth, the figure will be at 2%.  Therefore, the Government has met its target of 2% by 2007, which it set in 1997.</p>

            <p eId="para_1056">Is the Minister telling the House that no one is experiencing poverty?  Is it almost gone, so that we can forget about it and turn our backs on it?  Perhaps the Minister has been spending too much time removed from reality behind the tinted windows of his Mercedes.  Who is responsible for dealing with poverty in Ireland?  Where does the buck stop?</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">When it comes to moving long-term recipients of welfare and disability benefits into training and employment under the national employment action plan, I understand that lone parents and those with disabilities do not have access to the activation measures.  Does he have any plans to change that?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_438" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1058">There is still poverty in Ireland.  I made the point that the target of 2% that we set has been reached, and I stand by that.  We have changed the measure, and one does not need too many studies to see that there is poverty among lone parents, some older people, the unemployed and so on.  There is still unacceptable poverty, particularly child poverty, which has no place in Ireland in the 21st century.  The answer is to target the money available through the welfare system, something very much true of the recent budget, and co-ordinate across the Government policies on education, health, welfare and employment.  The last-named is ultimately the best way to attack poverty.  All those are powering ahead, and we have set new targets under the new measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">Regarding activation, I am not sure that I understand the question.  Lone parents are not currently subject to the FÁS activation programme, and neither are those on disability benefits.  However, both cases are being closely examined, the former in the context of our previous discussion on lone parents, and the latter in a general examination of how we can lend more support in training and education to those with disabilities.</p>

Some measures of poverty are allied to lifestyle.  We cannot give everyone the same lifestyle, but we can seek to remove poverty.  I seek to ensure that we no longer have in our midst what the Deputy and I would have known in our childhoods — good, old-fashioned poverty.  There is no place for that, however we measure it.  Certain indices are lifestyle measures, for example, how many holidays one gets in a year, how many friends one has around, and so on.  Some are the subject of debating societies.</p>

Poverty is not an absolute measure but about lack of opportunity and societal disparities in wealth.  Ireland remains one of the most unequal societies in Europe and is getting worse.  What other measures has the Minister put in place to tackle those areas?  Even if the Government reaches its 2% target, that does not end disparities in wealth or the lack of opportunity that so many people suffer.  Those are the real measurements of poverty, but I do not see the Government tackling them.</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1077">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 31 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The homemakers' scheme was introduced in 1994 to protect the social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years from 1994 to be spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for State pension contributory purposes.  Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker.  The homemaker's scheme does not, of itself, qualify a person for that pension, as the standard qualifying conditions relating to the type and number of contributions paid or credited must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The residency conditions of the scheme were changed in March 2005 so that, in effect, it is no longer necessary for a homemaker to reside with the person for whom he or she cares.  In addition, the deadline to register as a homemaker has also been extended for those homemakers from 6 April 1994 to 31 December 2006, and applications will be accepted until 31 December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">People in receipt of child benefit are automatically registered under the homemaker's scheme, as is the majority of applicants for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  A total of 15,034 people have been registered under the scheme since its introduction in 1994.  In 2004, some 1,760 people were registered, 1,569 people in 2005 and 1,055 in 2006.  The majority of these are people who did not qualify for the means-tested carer's allowance scheme or who had no entitlement to credited contributions under that scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">As part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions.  The homemaker's scheme will be reviewed in the context of the review.  It is expected that the Green Paper will be finalised by the end of March 2007 and published thereafter.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy on foot of this discussion.</p>

            <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1082">Is the Minister satisfied that the scheme is being utilised to its maximum potential, given that the numbers he cited seem to have fallen in recent years?  How does the Department advertise the scheme?  Does the Department have figures on women undertaking home-making duties before 1994 who are unable to benefit from the scheme?  Are there any estimates of the cost of the scheme to the State?  What are the procedures for automatically registering people on the scheme?</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1083">Many of these issues, including policy issues, are being examined in the context of the Green Paper.  The residency condition of the scheme was changed in March 2005 when new legislation was introduced to bring it into line with the carer's schemes.  A person can now qualify as a homemaker once he or she satisfies certain non-residency conditions.  In effect, this means that it is no longer necessary for a homemaker to reside with the person for whom he or she is caring.  I do not have a cost figure off-hand for the Deputy but I will see if I can obtain one for him.  I take the Deputy's point and think the scheme could be used more.  We will continue to promote it.  A stay-at-home father who, for example, is caring for a child under 12 might consider registering.  Any persons providing care to an incapacitated person aged 12 or over, and who has not claimed carer's allowance, carer's benefit or respite care grant, may also register as a home-maker.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">We need to promote the scheme more and I am undertaking to do so.  The Green Paper review will have to deal with some of the more medium and longer-term policy issues surrounding this scheme.</p>

Does the Minister have any plans to make the scheme retrospective to take into account people who took up home-making duties before the scheme was introduced?  How many people looking after children at home do not currently qualify because they did not enter the scheme in time, in 1994?</p>

            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_1098">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 40 and 164 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">Since taking office the Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in the Programme for Government aimed specifically at this group.  I am pleased to say that we have delivered on the most recent of these commitments, which was to increase the non-contributory State pension to €200 per week by 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">The contributory State pension has passed this mark and now stands at €209.30 per week.  Pension increases have been well ahead of inflation, thus ensuring that they are significantly improved in real terms.  Since 1996, and including the recent budget increases, pensions have increased by almost 119% or about 57% in real terms.  The Government has not committed itself at this stage to any particular rate of pension for the future.  Rather, I am determined that we will build on the success achieved in this area and, as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016, it was agreed to work with the social partners over a ten-year period to enhance pension provision and income supports generally.  This will include further enhancements of social welfare pensions over the period and a commitment to build on the now achieved 2007 target of €200 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">According to the most recent data from the Central Statistics Office, gross average industrial earnings were €601 per week in September 2006.  On that basis, a pension based on 40% of gross average industrial earnings would be approximately €240 per week, and a 50% pension would be approximately €300 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">The estimated additional costs in a full year of bringing all maximum rates for those over 66 up to these levels, while maintaining the current relationship of increases for qualified adults to the personal rates, are approximately €720 million and €2 billion respectively.  These estimates are based on the current number of older people in receipt of a pension.  They include the cost of increasing payments to qualified adults to maintain their current proportional relationship to the personal weekly rates of payment, but do not include any additional people that would qualify for a means-tested pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The Government is preparing a Green Paper on pensions and I expect that this will be finalised by the end of this month.  It will include a discussion of all aspects of our pension system, including the contribution of social welfare pensions to ensuring an adequate income for older people in retirement, which is at the same time sustainable in the long-term.  Following the publication of the Green Paper, the Government will respond by establishing a framework for future pension policy.</p>

Were any particular targets set in that regard, or did the social partners address that issue?  Was the Minister caught on the hop by the Tánaiste, Deputy McDowell's, solo-run intervention, or was it a naked pitch for the grey vote?  It startled everybody across the country and not just the Minister present.  Did the Tánaiste give any indication, perhaps via a sneak preview, to his Government partners?  In that context, did I understand the Minister to say that 50% of average industrial earnings is measured at €300?</p>

Gross average industrial earnings were €601 in September 2006.  On that basis, a pension based on 40% of gross average industrial earnings would be approximately €240 per week.  A 50% pension would be approximately €300 per week.  The estimated additional costs, in a full year, of bringing all maximum rates for those over 66 years of age to these levels, while maintaining the current relationship of increases for qualified adults to personal rates, are approximately €720 million and €2 billion respectively.  This includes the qualified adult allowances, QAAs.</p>

            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1123">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and point out to him that this is an important matter relating to the issue of extraordinary rendition.  We debated this issue last summer with regard to Senator Marty's report.  The matter was subsequently further investigated and went to the European Parliament.  A resolution emanated from that Parliament on 14 February.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Both the Senator Marty report and the European Parliament's resolution were highly critical of the Irish Government and the manner in which it dealt with the issues of extraordinary rendition, the transportation of detainees and the use of Irish airports by Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, operated aircraft.  Senator Marty said the United States had "progressively woven a clandestine spider's web of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful interstate transfers, spun with the collaboration or tolerance of Council of Europe members".</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">He went on to mention member states of the European Union, including Ireland, that could be held responsible for active or passive collusion — in the sense of having tolerated or having been negligent in fulfilling the duty to supervise — involving secret detention and unlawful interstate transfers of persons whose identity so far remains unknown.  He felt Ireland in particular could be responsible, in this sense, for permitting the use of Shannon airport for the stopover of flights involving the unlawful transfer of detainees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">After the debate here last summer, the matter went before a temporary committee while it was addressed separately by the Council of Europe.  A report was then sent to the European Parliament which concluded in the following terms on the subject of "the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners":</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1127">The European Parliament welcomes the testimony given to the temporary committee by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Irish Government as well as his unequivocal criticism of the process of extraordinary rendition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">However, they noted that "he failed to answer all the questions in relation to the concerns that Irish airports may have been used by CIA aircraft travelling to or from extraordinary rendition missions, as in the case of Abu Omar".</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">The European Parliament thanked the Irish Human Rights Commission for its testimony and endorsement of the view which considered that "the acceptance by the Irish Government of diplomatic assurances would not fulfil Ireland's human rights obligations".  The diplomatic assurances that the Minister so often quotes are not regarded as adequate by the European Parliament or the Irish Human Rights Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">The European Parliament made reference to human rights obligations that would oblige the Government to actively seek to prevent any actions that could in any way facilitate torture or ill-treatment in Ireland or abroad.  It went on to say it regretted the decision of the Irish Government not to follow the Irish Human Rights Commission's advice in the matter.  The European Parliament wrote that it noted the 147 stopovers made by CIA operated aircraft at Irish airports and expressed concern about the purpose of those flights which came from or were bound for countries linked with extraordinary rendition circuits and the transfer of detainees.  They deplored the stopovers in Ireland of aircraft that had been shown to have been used by the CIA, on other occasions, for the extraordinary rendition.  They go on to name and number the people taken in this fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">The European Parliament noted the absence of Irish parliamentary scrutiny of either Irish or foreign intelligence services and the potential for abuse that this created.  They considered that, in the absence of a system of random searches, a ban should be imposed on all CIA operated aircraft landing in Ireland.  They urged the Government to agree to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">I propose that the Government take on board the resolution passed by the European Parliament that urged it to set up a parliamentary inquiry.  It could be established under the auspices of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or the Committee on European Affairs or a joint sub-committee of these committees.  The inquiry would examine the circumstances I have outlined and report back to the Dáil.  The House would then take action arising from the findings of the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The European Parliament and Council of Europe are not satisfied that all questions have been answered.  It is not good enough to constantly reiterate the mantra that the Government has received categorical assurances from the highest authorities in the United States.  More definite information is needed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1134">The Government has made clear on several occasions its response to the report of the European Parliament's temporary committee examining extraordinary rendition and I do not propose to repeat its response in detail.  I will, however, again place on record the Government's unequivocal condemnation of extraordinary rendition, whether it emanates from friendly or hostile powers.  I also repeat that we welcome certain aspects of the report, in particular its effective confirmation that prisoners were never transferred through Irish territory.  This is a matter on which Ireland has received unparalleled assurances from the United States authorities, which are of a different quality and clarity from those received by most other countries.  Ireland was the first country to raise this issue with the United States authorities and has taken the lead in the European Union in highlighting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">It is a matter of serious disappointment that the temporary committee of the European Parliament squandered the opportunity to examine how to prevent, or at least deter, extraordinary rendition in future.  This failure exposes some of the committee's members to the allegation that they were show-boating on the issue, rather than addressing the underlying problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">As Dr. Maurice Manning, president of the Irish Human Rights Commission, has been reported as saying, the final report contains "a lot of political point-scoring".  Such was the degree of partisanship in it, that I understand certain Irish MEPs on the TDIP committee felt they could not vote on the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">As Deputies will be aware, extraordinary rendition in Europe has been the subject of investigations in the European Parliament and Council of Europe.  The Government's policy of co-operation with these investigations is demonstrated by the fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs was one of only two Ministers for Foreign Affairs to attend a meeting of the European Parliament's committee in Brussels.  At the Council of Europe, Ireland's response to a questionnaire circulated by the Secretary General was one of only nine of 46 member state responses which he adjudged to be sufficiently exhaustive as not to require further clarification.  International evidence clearly shows that Ireland has been proactive and responsive on this matter.</p>

            <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_1150">I welcome the opportunity to raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, the issue of road traffic related noise.  The M50 runs through my constituency, from Leopardstown through Stepaside, Sandyford, Ballinteer, Rathfarnham, Edmondstown, Ballyboden and Knocklyon.  I raise the need for noise abatement measures in that context, although the issue has acquired national relevance as a result of the growth in traffic volumes nationwide.  While the Minister of State does not have responsibility for the environment, he will be aware of the problem I raise because he represents an adjoining constituency which is also affected by traffic related noise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">The environmental impact statements prepared for road proposals contain noise predictions.  While Ireland does not have national standards, the British standard, under which decibel levels above the value of 74 are regarded as meriting noise abatement measures, are usually accepted.  The nub of the problem is that traffic volumes and, consequently, noise levels, on the M50 and its approach roads are infinitely greater than predicted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">Having stood in the front gardens or at the front doors of constituents, it is not an exaggeration to state it is impossible to carry on a conversation in some of them because one cannot hear oneself speak.  It is easy to imagine the impact of such continuous noise levels on families' quality of life.  This appalling noise occurs night and day, during the week and at weekends.  One does not need to be a medical expert to know that living permanently in this type of environment will impact on general health and well-being as well as hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">While I accept the need for new motorways and roads, many people in my constituency are being asked to pay too high a price in order that the rest of us can have better roads.  The problem is not confined to the M50 motorway.  Many of its approach roads are worse because no attempt has been made to provide noise abatement measures on them.  None of this would matter if the motorway cut through green pastures but in the greater Dublin area, specifically my constituency of Dublin South, the M50 ploughs through residential suburbia where hundreds and thousands of people are raising families and hoping to live in peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">The reason I raise this issue at this time is that two opportunities are emerging to address the problem.  The first of these is the upgrade of the M50.  It would be unthinkable and unforgivable to increase the capacity of the motorway and consequently the noise levels to which families would be subjected, while ignoring the opportunity to increase robust and effective noise amelioration measures.  The implementation of European Union directive 2002/49/EC presents a second opportunity to address the issue.  The directive requires that all populated areas are mapped to establish noise levels.  While this is a welcome development, unfortunately there is no timescale for the implementation of action plans to deal with the problems identified as part of the mapping process.  The M50 will produce the most severe noise hot spots.  I ask the Minister to ensure these areas are accorded urgent priority for action to ameliorate noise levels in advance of any timescale for action laid down by the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">I cannot overstate the constant, injurious and mind-numbing unpleasantness caused to residents by unprotected proximity to major roads.  The Government must act immediately to protect these residents or face court cases which will force it to do so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_495" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1156">I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to deal with this important issue.  The Roads Act 1993 firmly places responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads, including the M50, on the National Roads Authority, NRA.  Issues relating to noise pollution and other environmental issues are dealt with during the planning approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">The M50 motorway and all its approach roads have experienced massive traffic growth in line with the significant economic and employment growth of recent years and the consequent increase in rates of car ownership.  The current position is that the M50 is operating beyond its designed capacity.  Average annual daily traffic flows on several sections of the motorway are in excess of 85,000 vehicles.  As a result, congestion occurs at peak times.  The Government and the NRA are fully committed to improving the level of service provided to motorists on the M50.  This will be best achieved through the M50 upgrade project along with the move to barrier-free tolling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">The upgrade project involves the widening of some 32 km of motorway from two to three lanes in each direction, with a fourth auxiliary lane in places, from the M50-M1 interchange near Dublin Airport through to the Sandyford interchange, and the upgrade of ten junctions along this length.  The total cost of the upgrade is some €1 billion and it is being undertaken in three phases.  Phase one comprises the widening of the carriageway between the N4 Galway Road roundabout and Ballymount interchanges and the upgrading of the N4, N7 and Ballymount interchanges.  Work has commenced and is expected to be completed by mid-2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">Phase two comprises the widening of 24 km of the M50, other than the West Link section between the N3 and N4 junctions, and the upgrade of interchanges.  The NRA aims to award the contract for phase two in mid-2007 and expects that construction will be completed in 2010.  Phase three comprises the widening of the West Link section between the N3 and N4 junctions, which is expected to commence in spring 2007 and to be completed by mid-2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">It is against this background that I will now turn to the specific issue raised by the Deputy.  The M50 upgrade is a major infrastructure project by any standards.  The delivery of the project is immensely complicated by the need to carry out the work under live traffic conditions.  This imposes serious constraints on those carrying out the works and on motorists using the facility.  It is simply not possible to implement a project of this scale without incurring a worsening of traffic conditions and causing a certain amount of unavoidable disruption to the lives of people living in the vicinity of these works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The NRA informs me it is aware of its obligations pursuant to European Directive 2002/49/EC, which was transposed into Irish law by the Environmental Noise Regulations, SI 140 of 2006, by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The arrangements entered into between the NRA and local authorities in the Dublin area provide for the NRA to carry out noise mapping on all national roads outside the agglomeration of Dublin.  The various local authorities will be charged with mapping the M50 itself and all roads within their administrative areas with traffic volumes in excess of 6 million per annum.  Moreover, section 7 of the Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 places the responsibility for developing action plans to deal with noise issues on the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">I am assured by the NRA that it is striving to find a balance between the need to complete the much needed upgrade of the M50 as early as possible while at the same time mitigating the negative impacts of construction.  For example, the  NRA, local authorities and Garda are co-operating closely to ensure everything possible is done to mitigate the impact of the work on traffic flows.  In addition, the NRA and the contractors are working to strict noise abatement constraints that were imposed as part of the planning approval granted by An Bord Pleanála.  The imposition of these constraints is adding to the length of time it will take to complete the works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">I am informed that the works are on target for completion within their respective deadlines.  I expect that when the works are completed, residents of the areas affected will notice a significant reduction in the noise generated by both the construction works themselves and by passing traffic.</p>

            <p eId="para_1165">Following the Government decision in 1999 to extend the An Post contract for the delivery of social welfare payments for a further 3 years, a complaint was lodged with the European Commission alleging that the decision breached Ireland's obligations under:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1166">(a) the competition articles of the EU Treaty, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1167">(b) Directive 92/50/EU — the Procurement (Services) Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">The competition-related complaint was closed in March 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">In June 2002 the Commission issued a formal notice of infringement informing Ireland that it was of the view that the Department had failed to fulfil its obligations under European Union public procurement law in deciding to award a further contract to An Post without advertising it to other potential suppliers.  My Department, having consulted the Attorney General's office, contested the Commission's view.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">In 2003, the Commission referred the case to the Court of Justice.  The Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and France joined Ireland's defence to the Commission's application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">The Advocate-General to the European Court of Justice gave an opinion on the case on 14th September 2006 and concurred with the European Commission's view that Ireland had breached EU non-discrimination rules by not publicly advertising the payment delivery service.  It is expected that the Court will give its judgement shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">No further actions can be taken until the judgement is known. However, recognizing the essential payment delivery service which An Post currently provides for my Department, and pending the judgement from the Court of Justice, An Post continues to provide these services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1175">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st of May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">Decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by Deciding Officers.  Statistics are not maintained on cases where the decision is positive.  Complex cases that require detailed consideration are examined in dedicated units established for that purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">For the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 January 2007, the number of these complex cases decided was 47,265.  The number of applications decided in respect of Irish citizens was 12,112, of which 1,258 (10%) were disallowed.  The number of cases decided in respect of persons other than Irish nationals was 35,123 of which 10,083 (29%) were disallowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">A person who fails to satisfy the habitual residence condition and is suffering financial hardship may apply to the Health Service Executive for an Emergency Needs Payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Such payments are not subject to the habitual residence condition.  Persons who do not have any means of support may also be assisted to travel back to their home country by the Reception and Integration Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">Nationals of the European Economic Area (EEA) who take up employment in the State are protected under the EU Regulations governing social security for migrant workers.  Migrant workers from outside the EEA qualify for social insurance benefits in respect of the unexpired part of their work permits if they satisfy the normal qualifying conditions.  The habitual residence condition does not apply in these cases.  Such workers may also satisfy the habitual residence condition for receipt of social assistance payments and child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The reason for the introduction of the habitual residence condition in May 2004 was to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established habitual residence should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit. The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006.  Following on from that, the operational guidelines for the scheme are currently being revised to ensure consistency in the application of the condition and to take account of the variety of individual situations which can arise. However, it is not proposed to introduce any changes to the current policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.  I have no plans to conduct further research on the application of the habitual residence condition at this time.</p>

         asked the

        [2723/07]

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_498">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1186">The provision of occupational pensions in Ireland is on a voluntary basis and depends on the willingness of employers to contribute to and maintain schemes for their employees. Traditionally, such schemes were organised on a defined benefit basis. However, in recent years defined benefit (DB) provision has been under significant cost pressure because of volatility in the stock markets and increasing liabilities arising from demographic pressures, low interest rates, increasing wage costs that translate into higher benefits, and regulatory requirements. The reporting requirements of the accounting standard FRS 17 mean that the asset and liability position of pension schemes is made transparent on the balance sheet of a company and this in turn has also influenced the view employers take of DB provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">The funding standard under Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990, which applies to funded DB occupational pension schemes, is designed to ensure that, if a funded DB scheme winds up, there are sufficient assets to meet the liabilities at that point in time. The Act requires the trustees of DB schemes to submit to the Pensions Board an Actuarial Funding Certificate (AFC), every 3 years, to certify that the scheme meets the statutory funding standard. Where a scheme does not meet the funding standard a funding proposal, to restore the scheme to full funding, must be submitted to the Pensions Board designed to ensure a return to full funding within 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">In recent years, following a review of the Funding Standard by the Pensions Board in 2004, legislative measures have been introduced to alleviate the funding pressure some schemes are under, due to investment losses and the liability side of pensions. The measures provide that, where a scheme's funding difficulties are due to investment losses or difficulties on the liability side of the fund, a recovery plan may be effected over a longer period of up to 10 years. The Pensions Board, in consultation with key stakeholders, including officials from my Department, is continuing to review the funding standard and the impact of FRS 17 in the context of the overall increasing cost of DB schemes and will report to me shortly in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">I expect that the Green Paper, which will address the issues raised by the Deputy, will be finalised by the end this month and published thereafter. A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy on foot of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">As part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016, the Pensions Board has been asked to research benefit design options in the occupational pensions area and to examine defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements with a view to producing guidance as to designs which encompass the positive elements of each arrangement, while adjusting the costs and risks to the parties involved. I understand that work in this regard is well advanced.</p>

        <b>Mr. McGinley</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the education and training programmes currently available through his Department to carers who wish to return to the workforce; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_499">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1192">The Carers allowance is essentially designed for full-time carers.  Carers are allowed to work or attend a course of study for up to 15 hours per week, in recognition of the economic and therapeutic values of work and courses of study, while still safeguarding the needs of the care recipient.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">My Department administers a range of back to education programmes, under the umbrella of its social and family support services, to encourage and facilitate persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments, including recipients of carers allowance, to return to full–time work through the acquisition and improvement of skills and academic qualifications which will enable them to compete more successfully for employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">Programmes range from basic literacy courses through to certain postgraduate university courses, and include the back to education allowance scheme, which covers full-time second and third level courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">The back to education allowance scheme is available to persons in receipt of carers allowance in circumstances where the carer is ceasing caring responsibilities on a temporary or permanent basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">The back to education allowance is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  The scheme itself is not means tested and, consequently, former carers can take up part-time employment during the academic year and full-time employment during the summer period without affecting their payment.  In addition, participants receive a cost of education allowance of €400 which is payable at the beginning of each academic year.  Participants also retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they had while in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment that qualified them for participation in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">The range of back to education programmes operated by my Department take cognisance of the fact that the more structured full-time second or third level courses of study such as those that are approved under the back to education allowance scheme may not suit persons who have been out of the education system for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">In recognition of this, in the recent budget, I extended the €32 weekly out of pocket expenses payment to persons in receipt of a carer's allowance who agree to attend specified short-term courses of education, training or development that are organised by my Department's facilitators.  A broad range of courses may be pursued, including personal development courses, basic education e.g. literacy and numeracy classes, general training courses and the acquisition of specific job skills.  The out of pocket expenses is a payment towards costs such as meal and travel costs, that persons may incur as a result of participation in one of these courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">I am satisfied, overall, with my Department's back to education programmes of support to those, including carers, who are seeking return to the labour market.  The programmes are kept under regular review to ensure that they continue to support those who are most in need.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1209">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 18, 21, 35, 64, 66, 67, 72 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 52 independent companies nation-wide operating the service.  The credit union movement has been a key partner in MABS since its inception and their involvement and support is central to the development and success of the service. Other voluntary and statutory bodies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, Citizens Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">In 2001 MABS dealt with some 9,000 new clients. In 2006, it provided services to some 12,500 new clients and the number of active cases at the end of the year was some 14,900. The growth in demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit generally and to the quality of the service provided by MABS advisors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">In 2006, €16.4 million was provided to fund the service and in 2007 I have further increased the annual allocation to €17.67 million to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex.  The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties these people encounter in managing their finances. I am particularly concerned about the unacceptably high level of interest rates currently being charged by some financial institutions, loan companies and by legal moneylenders in situations where people have no alternative sources of credit available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">I have held discussions with a number of groups including the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Irish Bankers Federation and the Financial Regulator about these issues. The outcome of these consultations, the Combat Poverty Report, ‘Financial Exclusion in Ireland — An Exploratory Study and Policy Review' commissioned by the Financial Regulator, together with the statistical data now emerging from the new MABSIS information system will make a significant contribution to our knowledge about the problems of debt in Ireland.  They will inform the strategies that need to be put in place by both Government and the providers of payment services such as the Banks and Credit unions to promote greater financial inclusion in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">I plan to bring proposals to the Government shortly to establish the MABS on a statutory basis.  My proposals for legislation will build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public and will include measures to address concerns about excessive loan charges for people on low incomes.  The proposals will combine a continuation of local voluntary involvement with strong national leadership and ensure a high quality, coordinated budgeting and advice service for the future, in particular for people on low incomes. The proposals for the new legislation will take account of the significant developments which have taken place in MABS since the previous Bill was published in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">The proposals entail a number of specific actions to address some of the issues that leave people on low incomes vulnerable to high cost credit charges. While the regulation of money lending comes under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 and the licensing of moneylenders is a statutory responsibility of the Financial Regulator, my view is that the MABS has a key role to play in informing the licensing process in these circumstances. Officials of my Department are working closely with the Financial Regulator and with the Department of Finance on the detailed legislative provisions required to give MABS an input into these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">This work is nearing completion and I plan to bring the proposals to Government shortly. They will be informed by the consultations I have had with a range of individuals as well as the expert views of key MABS interests including money advisors, MABS voluntary boards of management and other stakeholders such as the credit union movement.   The new legislation will take account of best practice in corporate governance for a customer focused service that provides value for money for the taxpayers investment and meets the challenges posed by the rapidly changing face of debt in 21st century Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1219">The introduction of a personal advocacy service is provided for in the Citizens Information Act, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">The Act has as its primary purpose the amendment of the Comhairle Act, 2000, to assign additional and enhanced functions to the Citizens Information Board, formerly Comhairle, which operates under the aegis of my Department, to enable it to introduce a personal advocacy service to individuals, in particular those with a disability. The service will assist the individuals concerned in identifying and understanding their needs and options and assist them in securing their entitlements to social services. Social services are broadly defined and include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, consumer matters, employment and training, equality, asylum and immigration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">In order to expand advocacy provision for people with disabilities the Citizens Information Board, began a process in 2004 of engaging the community and voluntary sector in the provision of advocacy services to people with disabilities and also produced advocacy guidelines to inform and guide organizations in the development of advocacy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">Thirty projects have been funded since 2004 to deliver representative advocacy services to people with disabilities, some of which are cross disability type, with others specifically targeting one particular type of disability. Each of the projects poses different challenges, some requiring more intensive work with smaller caseloads while others have larger caseloads with shorter periods of client contact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">It is difficult to estimate how many of the 323,000 people with disabilities in Ireland (CSO 2002) will seek an advocacy service. Demand will, to some extent, depend on public awareness of the services available, trust in the independence of advocates, and access to services. In this regard, the Citizen Information Board plan to undertake a public awareness campaign to address these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">The development of advocacy services remains a priority for my Department and in this regard additional funding of €1.9m has been provided for the Citizens Information Board in 2007 for the development of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities and for the implementation of the Disability Sectoral Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">The Citizens Information Board has commenced work on establishing the Personal Advocacy Service. It is envisaged that the new service will be up and running in early 2008.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_502">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1227">In Budget 2006, I announced a wide range of important reforms for non-contributory pensioners in conjunction with the introduction of the State Pension (non-contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">These reforms included improvements to the means test for pensioners generally, including the raising of the weekly means disregard from €7.60 to €20.  As part of the pension reforms, I also announced a specific additional disregard of €100 per week where the pensioner and/or spouse is in employment.  This new disregard, relating to earnings from employment, is intended as an incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The new disregard was effective from the 29th of September last year.  In June 2006, all  non contributory pensioners in receipt of a reduced pension who were likely beneficiaries of the disregard were notified directly by my Department of the impending introduction of the employment earnings disregard.  Approximately 380 pensioners are known to have benefited from the introduction of the new employment disregard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">To further encourage State pensioners to participate in the workplace I announced, in Budget 2007, that the disregard would double, from €100 to €200 per week, effective from January 2007.  The increased earnings disregard is equivalent to €10,400 a year and would allow a State Pensioner the opportunity to earn additional income through employment without effecting their full pension entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">While labour force participation by people aged 55-64 years is increasing in Ireland and is the sixth highest of the twenty seven EU countries, participation by people over 65 years has been declining over many years.  I would expect that the doubling of the disregard should act as a further incentive to pensioners to return or remain in the workforce.  It should also help address the concerns of pensioners about reductions in pensions and benefits, along with affording them the opportunity to increase their weekly income and standard of living.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">It should of course be borne in mind that the €200 disregard is relevant only to non-contributory state pensions and that over 70% of state pensioners are receiving contributory pensions.  The change to the State Pension (Non Contributory) employment earnings disregard should not only be seen as society's recognition of the contribution our older people have made to the building of modern Ireland, but also sends out the message that we value the potential contribution that these men and women can make to society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">While it is not yet clear how successful this initiative will be in increasing labour market participation by older people, the early signs are encouraging and I am optimistic about the prospects for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1235">Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the European Union. This includes not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes and other social inclusion programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">The latest such statistics were published recently by the EU Commission in an Annex to its 2007 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion and cover developments up to and including 2004. No comparable figures are yet available for 2005 or 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">When examining such data it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments. For example, tax relief on contributions towards occupational and private pensions, which are an important feature of Ireland's pension system, is not counted as expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">In 2004, social protection expenditure accounted for 27.3% of GDP in the EU-25 countries.  The corresponding ratio for Ireland was 17% — up almost 3 percentage points from 2000 (14.1%).  The Joint Report acknowledges that the very significant growth in GDP in Ireland means that the very significant real increases in benefit rates and child income support introduced in recent years is somewhat masked. It further notes that the level of expenditure in Ireland is also significantly influenced by the lower proportion of pensioners and the reliance on private pension provision to supplement the State pensions; and lower spending on unemployment benefits in the light of sustained low unemployment figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">The fact is that under this Government there has been a sustained and substantial increase in social protection expenditure. Moreover, it should be noted that social welfare expenditure will have increased substantially during the 3 year period 2005 to 2007 — an overall increase of 26.3%, well ahead of the corresponding projected increases in prices and earnings. Following the improvements announced in the 2007 Budget, overall spending on social welfare will increase this year to a total of €15.47 billion — an increase of over €190 million from 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">This Government will continue to address the scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure, guided by the new National Anti Poverty Strategy, and the National Development Programme while at the same time continuing to take the measures necessary to maintain economic growth and competitiveness and thereby generate the resources for further social investment.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the status of his plans to merge the family income supplement and child dependent allowance into a second tier child income support payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [7993/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_504">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1242">In the context of an overall review of targeted child income support payments, the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with child dependant allowance and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">NESC has indicated that, as the proposed second tier income support represents a new approach to targeting, the issues involved are complex and there are technical and policy challenges to be overcome.  The Council's analysis of these issues will, I believe, be of assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the partnership agreement ‘Toward 2016' which committed to completing consideration of the issues within one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">While jobs are a most effective way of lifting families and their children out of poverty and child benefit accounts for 68% of child income support payment, I have long held the view that implementing a targeted second tier payment for children in low income and welfare families could have an important impact on child poverty. The significantly improved and targeted measures announced in Budget 2007 represent a substantial move in that direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Family income supplement income thresholds have been increased in Budget 2007 and improve the weekly payments of almost all existing FIS recipients by €9 for a one child family, to €111 for a family with eight or more children.  Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families and this improvement continues the re-focusing of thresholds towards larger families which started in Budget 2006, thereby further targeting resources at low-income households.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">In addition, in Budget 2007 all three child dependant allowance rates which had remained unchanged since 1994, were increased to a single rate of €22 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">These changes represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.</p>

            <p eId="para_1251">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 54 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The report by ERM Consulting Poverty and Social Inclusion, Linking Local and National Structures, which I recently launched, is being examined by the Office for Social Inclusion in my Department and by other Departments, including the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The importance attached by the report to the effective implementation of social inclusion policies at both national and local level, and the need for strong linkages between both levels, is reflected in several key elements of the government's social inclusion strategy.  The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, which adopts the life cycle framework to address social exclusion, recognises that effective delivery of services at national and local levels, with flexibility to adapt to change, is essential to tackle the challenges faced by people at different stages of the life cycle.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion), also recognise the importance of improved linkages and integration of existing structures.  Both plans include commitments to support the work of the County/City Development Boards (CDBs) which, together with the Social Inclusion Measures Groups, are key structures in ensuring better co-ordination and delivery of policies at local level, a point acknowledged in the ERM report.  Further evidence of the Government's commitment in this area can be seen from the agreement in Towards 2016 to double the number of social inclusion units in local authorities and to have a unit in half of all authorities by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">The Government has put in place mechanisms to ensure that social inclusion policies are effectively implemented at a local level across the country.  The Local Government Social Inclusion Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is a key structure in this process.  The group's aim is to support the development of a strong anti-poverty focus within local government.  Furthermore, the NAPinclusion provides for the further development of this group to support the linkages between national and local level and it will report on progress to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.  The recommendations made in the report and associated policy statement by the Combat Poverty Agency, including the proposal for a National Implementation Group to monitor implementation at local level, will be considered in the context of further developing the institutional structures for promoting social inclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1261">I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 24, 32, 53, 65, 70 and 165 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">As part of the health service reform programme, the Government has decided to transfer certain functions, associated staff and other resources from the Health Service Executive to my Department.  The functions to be transferred include the supplementary welfare allowance and infectious diseases maintenance allowance schemes, as well as certain other functions.  The transfer of functions is a major project that has implications for important services and also affects, on a personal level, the staff delivering these services.  Accordingly the programme to implement the transfer is being managed in a careful and comprehensive manner to ensure that the services and position of the staff involved are protected.  The HSE and my Department are engaged in a comprehensive programme to collect information on all elements of the functions undertaken by the Community Welfare Service.  This information is essential for the successful planning and implementation of the transfer process and to ensure that all aspects of the current service are fully taken into account.  Throughout the implementation programme there will be direct and extensive consultation with the staff affected by the transfer of functions programme.  A communications and consultation strategy has been devised that provides for ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders associated with the programme.  In that regard, my Department met the entire cadre of superintendents on two occasions last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">A series of regional briefings is being organised jointly by the HSE and my Department for all staff in the Community Welfare Service.  These briefings will commence this month and will provide an opportunity for further constructive engagement and feedback on the implementation programme.  My Department also holds regular meetings with the two trade unions representing Community welfare Officers (CWOs).  The most recent meeting was on 8 February 2007 and there were three such meetings in 2006.  The transfer programme was discussed at all of those meetings.  The health sector National Joint Council (NJC) brings together the two trade unions, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  The NJC meets regularly and it too has discussed the transfer of functions.  To supplement this, a Joint Liaison Group involving the two trade unions, health sector management and my Department has been established.  This group is due to hold its first meeting within a few weeks.  In advance of this meeting a document outlining the joint high level proposals of the HSE, my Department and the Department of Health and Children is being sent to all the trade unions concerned, including trade unions representing staff within my Department.  I am satisfied with this considerable level of consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">The SWA scheme is administered by some 700 CWOs and 59 superintendents and supporting clerical and other staff within the Community Welfare Service of the HSE.  They provide a service that is flexible, responsive and outcome driven.  The transfer of functions will not change this.  There will be no loss of flexibility, discretion or personal service on the part of CWOs.  The same staff will administer the schemes and provide the same personal service under the same legislation and guidelines as at present.  The existing legislation governing the scheme will largely remain.  All of the linkages to other services in the health sector and elsewhere will remain and indeed will be strengthened under the new arrangements.  The transfer will harness co-operation in a more cohesive and a co-ordinated manner for the benefit of the disadvantaged in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">In November 2006, my Department published the report of the working group on the Review of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.  The working group carried out a fundamental review of all aspects of the SWA scheme.  The report presents a number of recommendations relating to the future of the scheme and provides a valuable working template to support the transfer programme.  My Department's commitments in Towards 2016, the National Development Plan and the National Anti-Poverty strategy provide further underpinning for this enhanced approach.  To enable this to happen, I have made proposals for legislative changes in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill before the House.  What is proposed is a technical change that will be needed when CWOs are no longer HSE staff.  I have not set a firm date for the transfer pending further detailed consultations between the health sector and my Department.  However, I hope it will be possible to complete the transfer this year.  The implementation of the programme will be carefully managed to ensure that continuity of the SWA scheme and related services is maintained.  The provisions in the Bill are subject to a Commencement Order and will not come into effect until the transfer takes place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">In addition to the SWA scheme administered by CWOs, a decision has been made to transfer income supports includes existing allowances and payments made to or in respect of persons with a disability, including domiciliary care allowance, mobility allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance and blind welfare allowance.  In advance of their transfer a policy review of these schemes is under way, aimed at reviewing their original objectives and how those objectives will be met most effectively in the new environment.  Any necessary legislative changes arising from the review will be introduced in 2008.  While the report of the review of the illness and disability schemes undertaken in 2003 made some recommendations as regards the future of the Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance, this is being addressed in the wider context of the transfer of income supports from the HSE to my Department.  The scheme is a small one, with only 69 persons receiving a weekly payment at present.  The case for its integration within mainstream income support provision is, <i>prima facie</i>, a cogent one and this issue will be addressed in the context of the review.  While acknowledging the concerns that those delivering the service may have regarding the transfer programme generally, I am satisfied this is the correct way forward.  The SWA scheme is already funded by my Department and is part of the wider social welfare code.  In recent years new types of payments, computer development and modernisation of services enable customers to confidently carry out their business with my Department.  The transfer of functions will provide a platform from which to build on this and offers a challenge and an opportunity for all staff in the Community Welfare Service and my Department in developing a model system for supporting those most disadvantaged in society.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1272">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 42, 52, 56 and 62 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">The review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was carried out as part of the Government's Expenditure Review Initiative series of Programme Evaluation reviews.  Overall the review concluded that the scheme has, over the years, met its objective of guaranteeing that every person in the State has a minimum level of income sufficient to meet their basic day to day needs.  However, the review also points out that the scheme has gone beyond its original "safety net" role and now plays a more extensive role than was originally intended.  In overall terms the review argues for a unified system of income support delivered at Social Welfare Local Offices and complemented by a range of activation supports; vigorous support of the Rental Assistance Scheme to address housing needs of people in long-term rent supplementation; and a continued role for the Community Welfare Service in delivering a flexible and immediate response to those most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">In the case of rent supplement, the report recommends that the implementation of the rental assistance arrangements announced by Government in July 2004 should be vigorously pursued.  In addition to improving the housing situation for people on low incomes and delivering better value for money for the Exchequer, full implementation of the arrangements would allow the rent supplement scheme to return to its original objective of being a short-term income support scheme, with fewer than half of the current number of recipients.  The review identified a number of issues relating to the incentives under the rent supplement scheme for those wishing to take up an employment opportunity.  In Budget 2007 I specifically addressed this issue when I announced improvements in the additional income disregards for those taking up employment or training.  I said that any person who is on a local authority waiting list for accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (those with a long-term housing need), may return to full-time employment and be considered for a rent supplement payment under the standard means test as outlined above.  This new system replaces the existing special retention arrangements, so that in the case of a person aged 65 or over whose combined household income is greater than the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her circumstances, an amount equal to the difference between the maximum rate of State pension appropriate to his or her circumstances and the said rate of supplementary welfare allowance is no longer assessed in the means test for rent or mortgage interest supplement.  These measures provide for significant improvements to the rent supplement scheme in terms of simplifying the current assessment process and in offering clear incentives to those returning to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, an exceptional or urgent needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment; each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  If an urgent needs payment is paid to a person who is engaged in remunerative full-time work, the Health Service Executive may, if it is satisfied that in all the circumstances of the case it would be equitable to do so, determine or decide that the whole or part of the allowance so paid shall be recoverable from the person to whom it is paid.  While the review of the SWA scheme contained a number of detailed recommendations for reform it did not recommend a loan scheme and I have no intention at this stage of introducing one.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">The review included a detailed examination of expenditure and recipient trends for all elements of the scheme.  The Group identified variations in the level of expenditure on exceptional needs payments but considered that such variations were likely to occur as the payments are made on the basis of a person's need and it was reasonable to expect that such needs would not occur uniformly across the country.  The Working Group also examined the average value of exceptional needs payment throughout the country in relation to the various different types of exceptional and urgent needs payments and found variations in the levels of payments that could not be explained by geographical cost factors.  While noting this, I am conscious that the discretionary nature of the payments is in itself a contributing factor to the variation in the level of payments.  A balance has to be struck between the enforcement of a consistent approach and exercise of discretion on a case by case.  During 2007 my Department will continue to monitor these payments.  However, I will not take any action that might restrict the discretionary nature of the scheme in a manner that would be detrimental to people availing of the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">The working group also recommended an easing of the means test for SWA purposes in the assessment of capital. Under existing rules the first €520 of capital is assessed at one-twentieth with the amount in excess of this amount assessed at one-tenth.  In Budget 2007 I provided for an improved capital assessment under which the first €5,000 of capital will be disregarded; the next €10,000 will be assessed at €1 per €1,000; the next €25,000 will be assessed at €2 per €1,000; and the excess of €40,000 will be assessed at €4 per €1,000.  The change presents a more reasonable approach and allows a person to retain a more meaningful sum that could be utilized should an unexpected emergency arise.  I am making provision in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007, currently before the House, for the necessary legislation to give effect to this and other Budget 2007 improvements in the SWA scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1282">The Citizens Information Act 2007 provides for the introduction of a personal advocacy service and for the renaming of Comhairle as the Citizens Information Board.  The name has been changed under the Citizens Information Act 2007 to more clearly represent the functions of the organisation and link it more directly to the citizens information services it provides and supports.  Under the Comhairle Act 2000, Comhairle — now the Citizens Information Board — had a statutory function to "support the provision of, or, where the Board considers it appropriate, to provide directly, independent information, advice and advocacy services, so as to ensure that individuals have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information relating to social services and are referred to the relevant service".  To deliver on this function, the Citizens Information Board has developed, funded and supported 42 Citizens Information Services throughout the country and one national Citizens Information Phone Service.  These services are limited companies, managed by Voluntary Boards of Management and they provide information services to the public in line with the Comhairle Act, 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The Citizens Information Board will continue to provide services through the network of Citizens Information Services around the country which provide face-to-face service from approximately 250 locations; the Citizens Information Phone Service, which is a LoCall service available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Friday; andits website, <i>www.citizensinformation.ie</i>.  The National Association of Citizens Information Services, NACIS, is a representative body for local and regional information providers within Citizens Information Services, inclusive of Board members, paid employees and volunteers.  It has been established with the support of the Citizens Information Board which provides its core funding.  NACIS and the Board meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of common interest and will continue to do so.  The Board will continue to provide all the services, supports and resources that have been provided to date by Comhairle to non-governmental organisations involved in information provision.  The Board will also continue to require that the Citizens Information Services and the Citizens Information Phone Service deliver information, advice and advocacy services to the public in line with the Board’s statutory requirements as laid out in the Comhairle Act 2000 and the Citizens Information Act 2007.  I assure Deputies that there will be no diminution of the services being provided and that the legislation, in fact, provides for an enhanced service to the public including provision of a Personal Advocacy Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 63 and 76 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">As the House will be aware, in early 2005 I asked the Pensions Board to undertake a review of overall pensions strategy because I considered that, on the basis of the progress being made at that time, there was little prospect of reaching the targets set by the Pensions Board for pensions coverage within a reasonable timescale.  The Board completed the National Pensions Review, which was published in January 2006.  The Board reaffirmed the various targets recommended in the original National Pensions Policy Initiative which included a retirement income, from all sources, of 50% of pre-retirement income, a social welfare pension equating to 34% of average industrial earnings and a supplementary pensions coverage rate of 70% for those aged over 30 years.  The Board recommended enhancements to the current voluntary system of supplementary pensions as it considers that the system has the potential to deliver significant improvements in coverage.  However, no truly voluntary pensions system has been able to deliver the sort of coverage rates for which we are aiming.  In that context, I asked the Pensions Board to explore in more detail the ideas for a mandatory or quasi-mandatory system, which had been set out in the National Pensions Review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">In August 2006, the Government published the Pensions Board report, Special Savings for Retirement, in which the Board suggested a model that could be considered if it were decided a mandatory system of supplementary pensions was required.  The model was aimed at low to middle earners and entails mandatory contributions of 15%, shared between employers, employees and the Exchequer, on earnings between €15,000 and €60,000.  This would be backed up by an improved social welfare pension, which would increase from a current level of 33% of gross average industrial earnings to 40%.  A timescale of 10 years was suggested for full implementation of this approach.  As the House is aware, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices and the challenges we face in the pensions area.  The two reports completed by the Pensions Board in 2006 are significant inputs to the process.  I expect that the Green Paper will be finalised by the end of this month and published as quickly as possible thereafter.  The social partners have been consulted on what they would like to see covered in the Paper.  As agreed in Towards 2016 a consultation process will then take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1291">The pre-Budget submission from the One Family organisation called for funding to be provided for a number of pilot family law and children's centres which would provide information and support services to families that have experienced breakdown and are affected by new family formation.  As this proposal is primarily focussed on the provision of family law information and the legal impact of new relationships, it is of interest in the first instance to my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, the submission also calls for the expansion of non-adversarial options for families experiencing separation and divorce and specifically increased resources for mediation as a method of dispute resolution.  My Department, through the Family Support Agency is responsible for the Family Mediation Service, a free, professional, confidential service for couples who have decided to separate.  The Family Mediation Service assists separating couples to address the issues on which they need to make decisions, including post-separation living arrangements, finances and parenting arrangements which will enable children to have an ongoing relationship with each parent.  With the assistance of a trained mediator couples look at these issues and, where possible, reach an agreement that meets both their interests and the interests of their children.  When a couple has reached agreement, a family session is offered to parents with their children to discuss their new family arrangements in an encouraging and positive way.  Couples can take the agreement prepared at mediation to their respective solicitors to have it formalised into a legal document.  The Family Support Agency also provides financial support for a network of Family Resource Centres (FRCs).  The aim of FRCs is, essentially, to help combat disadvantage by supporting the functioning of the family unit.  The emphasis in FRCs is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems faced by the community and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the areas concerned.  Centres provide services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support.  Services include the provision of information, advice and support to target families, the provision of education courses and training opportunities; and the provision of childcare facilities for those attending courses provided by the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_1295">I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 71 and 90 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">The most recent figures published by the CSO for supplementary pensions coverage relate to the fourth quarter of 2005 and show that 50.6% of women in employment had a private or occupational pension, compared to a coverage rate for men of 58.3% and a rate of 55% for the workforce as a whole.  This is a significant improvement on the 2002 position when 44.6% of women had such coverage.  The gap between coverage rates for men and women has narrowed from about 11% to just under 8%.  Nevertheless, the number of women with pensions coverage remains below average.  The survey referred to by the Deputy assumes that women who are at present outside the paid workforce do not have a pension.  There are no figures available on this aspect of the pensions situation so it is not possible to comment in any detail on the conclusions of the survey in question.  However given a workforce participation rate for women of 60% and pensions coverage reaching about 50% of these, it is clear that a sizeable number do not have any supplementary pensions coverage.  Changes in insurability of employment for PRSI purposes, particularly the extension of cover to part-time workers in 1991 and the operation of the home-maker's scheme will, in the future, ensure social welfare pension entitlement for most women.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">Women who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were, in the main, public servants who were never insured for social welfare pension purposes.  Accordingly, the loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.  That said, the Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.  Currently, there are some 47,000 people who are not receiving a pension payment in their own right or as a qualified adult on the pension of their spouse or partner.  These are mainly former public servants and self-employed people who were close to retirement or had retired before 1988, when the self-employed were brought within the social insurance system, together with their spouses.  The issues in relation to this group will be discussed in the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions and decisions regarding pension provision for them will be made in the context of the consultation process which will follow its publication and the framing of a long-term policy for overall pension provision.  The Green Paper is due to be finalised by the end of March.</p>

            <p eId="para_1300">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 79 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The national fuel scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments to meet the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from the end of September to mid-April.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet the costs in full.  Improvements to the fuel allowance in recent years include easing the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 29 weeks and increasing by €5 the rate of payment in the 2006 budget.  In Budget 2007, I have provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of €4 from €14 to €18 — €21.90 in designated smokeless areas — and I have increased the income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance by €49 from €51 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.  Some 274,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2006 at an estimated annual cost of €125.1m.  As a consequence of the increase in rate and the increase in the income threshold for eligibility announced in the recent Budget, annual expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will increase by an estimated €36.4 million.  The total annual cost in 2007 is estimated at €161.5m.  The increase in the rate of fuel allowance to €18 per week as announced as part of Budget 2007 will give over 274,000 people entitled to the allowance additional help to meet their heating costs.  The increase in the income threshold to €100 above the maximum state pension (contributory) will allow more people to qualify for fuel allowance.  While it is difficult to calculate the number benefiting as a result of this increase in the threshold, estimates indicate that up to 8,000 additional people could qualify for fuel allowance.   In 2006, some 41,000 recipients of State Pension (Contributory) and State Pension (Transition) received a fuel allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or only with a qualifying dependant.  The household composition and means test rules for fuel allowance scheme qualifying purposes are to ascertain the ability of applicant households to meet their normal heating requirements out of their own resources and to ensure that the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need of the fuel allowance support.  Only one fuel allowance is paid per household.  People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as state pension (non-contributory), long-term jobseeker's assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  Most people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.  In the case of contributory pensions such as state pension (contributory), state pension (transition) and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, from January 2007, a person may have a combined household income of up to €100 per week, or savings and investments of up to €58,000, over and above the maximum state pension (contributory) rate and still qualify for fuel allowance.  The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the state pension (contributory) rate.  Statistics are not available on the number of fuel allowance applications refused on the basis of other social welfare recipients residing with the fuel allowance claimant.  As a result it is not possible to estimate the cost of allowing more than one fuel allowance per household where a number of people in a house are receiving welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient's weekly social welfare payment.  The Government's objective is to ensure that the recipient's total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all their income needs, including heating costs.  Budget resources are concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates.  The increases of €16 and €18 per week in the rates of payment for contributoryand non-contributory pensions respectively announced in the recent budget is a continuation of this policy.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local Health Centre.  Any changes in relation to provision of basic income support, fuel allowance or the household benefits package would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">It is clear that being at work significantly reduces the risks of poverty and deprivation.  However, despite economic advances of the past years, some families find themselves dependent on low wage employment.  It is important to ensure that work pays and a number of policy instruments crossing a range of Departments are used as a way of preventing poverty amongst the working poor.  These include changes to the taxation system, the national minimum wage, provision of training and access to lifelong learning opportunities, assistance with job search and placement and changes to the social welfare system to support the transition to employment and improve the retention of non-cash benefits during that transition.  One of the principal policy responses in my Department which is designed to address the problem of low income working families, is the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.  A principal feature of this scheme is that it provides cash support to qualifying families even where they have not previously been in receipt of a social welfare payment.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might otherwise only be marginally better off than if he or she claimed other social welfare payments.  Where a person qualifies for FIS, the minimum weekly payment is €20.  Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families.  Recent evidence from the ESRI confirms that this remains substantially the case.  In this context, Budget 2007 increased the FIS earnings thresholds by €15 for a one child family up to €185 for an eight child family.  It is estimated that these increases will affect 21,100 families and that approximately 5,600 additional families will become eligible for a FIS payment through these increased thresholds.  The cost of these measures is estimated at €32 million in 2007 and in a full year.  The new FIS thresholds significantly increase all payments while concentrating additional resources on larger families. This continues the re-focusing of thresholds which started in Budget 2006, contributing towards targeting resources at households in poverty.</p>

            <p eId="para_1307">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force.  The allowance is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  To qualify for participation in the back to education scheme an applicant must be, <i>inter alia</i>, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or 12 months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.  The 12-month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process.  The back to education scheme was established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose employment opportunities would be enhanced by participation in the scheme.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme and this is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.  People who are already in employment are not considered to be in the target group for the scheme.  I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that the scheme continues to support those who are more distant from the labour market.  I have no plans to abolish or modify the qualifying criteria for participation in the scheme to include people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1309">My Department provides funding to a range of groups and organisations involved in the provision of supports and information to parents and families who are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  In 2006, over 400 projects or individuals were assisted through the Family Services Project (FSP) at a total cost of €2.2 million.  Courses supported included family support programmes and personal development programmes, the majority of which incorporated a parenting element.  The overall objective of the FSP is to provide a high quality information service on the range of supports available to families from State agencies and the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on the agencies and services available locally.  In addition to the FSP my Department also administers the Special Projects Fund, which is used to provide grants to projects run by third parties to help welfare recipients as well as members of their families to improve their employability through education, training and personal development.  My Department sees the Fund as a means of supporting innovative responses to increasing employability and tackling social inclusion.  There was €2.8 million available under the Fund in 2006 and over 160 projects were funded.  The two funding streams have been amalgamated with effect from the start of this year to provide greater flexibility in the funding streams available to assist individuals and families to enhance their employability through education, training and personal development opportunities.  The overall fund is administered by Facilitators based in my Department's Local Offices who work in conjunction with local Voluntary and Community groups and statutory organisations.  The fund is operated in a manner that enables a quick response to identified customer needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">My Department's role in this area is to increase the capacity of those in the most difficult circumstances by improving their self-esteem and personal and family situations through the training, developmental and educational opportunities made available.  In 2007 over €5.6 million is being made available through the amalgamated Fund.  The Family Support Agency, which comes under the remit of my Department, has statutory responsibility to promote and disseminate information about issues such as parenting and family responsibilities.  In 2007, the Agency has been allocated €35.339 million of Government funding to support families and has a mission "to promote family and community well being through the provision of appropriate supports and services to families".  A crucial element of this will be the investment of over €18 million in the Family Resource Centre programme which seeks to help combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit.  The emphasis in the projects is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned.  The services provided and activities supported by the resource centres are designed to meet the needs of the local community.  They include the provision of parenting courses, education and training opportunities for parents and active dissemination of information on a range of issues affecting families and local communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1312">The personal public service number, PPSN, is the individual's unique reference number for dealings with a range of Departments and public bodies.  A PPSN issues automatically to children who are born in Ireland.  In all other cases an application must be made at a local office of my Department.  When applying for a PPSN, individuals are asked to complete an application form and to provide documentation to establish their identity and address.  They are usually informed of their PPSN by post within five days.  In early January, following the accession of Romania to the EU, it emerged that incorrect information and advice and an interpretation service was being provided to certain Romanian applicants for PPSNs by a Romanian citizen resident in Ireland who was charging for this service.  The existence of this practice has been reported to An Garda Síochána for investigation and any follow-up action it considers appropriate if evidence of a breach or breaches of the law comes to light.  A number of Romanian citizens have been interviewed by officers of the Department and further specific action will be taken in these cases where possible and warranted.  My Department issued a statement on 29 January to prevent further exploitation of citizens of Romania.  The statement informed them that my Department does not charge for the issue of PPSNs and that, where necessary, translation and interpretation services are provided free of charge.  A copy of this statement in Romanian has been posted on my Department's website and arrangements have been made with the Chaplain to the Romanian Community in Dublin to have this information announced at religious services in the city.</p>

            <p eId="para_1316">The PRSI exemption scheme was first introduced in 1989 at a time of high unemployment and high emigration.  At the time, the scheme had a secondary focus on groups who might have difficulty entering the workforce, however its main aim was generalised job creation, rather than boosting the employment opportunities of disadvantaged groups.  Since 2003 the employer's PRSI exemption scheme is aligned directly with the back to work allowance scheme.  The scheme exempts employers from their share of the PRSI contribution in respect of recipients of the back to work allowance for the first two years of their employment.  The employees' PRSI contributions are payable in the normal way.  There is no limit on the number of people the employer can employ under the scheme.  Since February 2005, 1,370 employers have availed of the scheme with a total of 1,992 employees covered.  The scheme is continually monitored to ensure its relevance to current labour market and economic conditions.  The Indecon evaluation of the back to work allowance scheme which was published in December 2000 concluded that the PRSI exemption has little impact on employment decisions.  Given the major changes which have occurred in Irish labour market and economic conditions in recent years, I have no plans to extend the scheme to include other employees other than those who are currently on the back to work allowance.  I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements introduced in 2003 ensure that the scheme supports those who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.  I will continue to keep the scheme under regular review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1318">Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs Report on the Position of Full Time Carers, which was published in 2003 makes 15 recommendations, some of which relate specifically to my Department and others relate specifically to the Department of Health and Children.  The report recommended abolition of the means test for carer's allowance.  In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  This means test has been eased significantly over the years most notably with the disregard of spouse's earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">Since April 2006, the income disregard for a couple has been set at €580 per week, which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of the further improvements I announced in Budget 2007, this disregard will increase to €640 per week for a couple from April 2007.  This means that a couple with two children will be able to earn approximately €36,000 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.  Another of the recommendations was that if a person who is in receipt of a widow/er's pension is giving someone full-time care and attention, that person should be paid a half rate carer's allowance in addition to his or her pension.  In Budget 2007 I was pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area which go beyond this recommendation.  In future, people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments who are providing full-time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be the equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance.   It is estimated that this measure will benefit approximately 18,000 carers by up to €109 per week, at a cost of €56.72 million in a full year.  I have provided for these new arrangements in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which I published recently.  In Budget 2006 I extend the duration of carer's benefit from 15 to 24 months.  This is in line with the recommendations that the 15 month restriction be waived where the person continues to provide care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">The recommended extension of the respite care grant to people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer's allowance or benefit and who are providing someone with full-time care and attention was implemented in Budget 2005.  That improvement went beyond the report's recommendation, as the respite care grant was extended to all full-time carers regardless of means.  With regard to the provision of information, my Department gave the Carer's Association a grant to assist it in producing an information pack for carers.  I was pleased to launch that comprehensive pack during the summer.  In addition, my Department has recently run an information campaign about the income supports available for carers.  This involved a week-long campaign which included advertisements on radio, television and in the print media.  The report also recommended the development of a national strategy for carers.  I am delighted that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, is the development of a National Carers Strategy.  This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007.   All relevant Departments and agencies will be involved and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of this commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1322">PRSI Class D provides social insurance coverage for permanent and pensionable employees in the public service, other than those who were recruited after 6 April, 1995, doctors and dentists employed in the civil service, Gardai, commissioned army officers and members of the army nursing service. Public servants recruited on or after 6 April 1995 are liable to pay PRSI contributions at the ordinary Class A contribution. As a consequence, the numbers of contributors paying at the modified PRSI Class D rate is falling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">Employments which are insurable at PRSI class D are classified as modified employments. The rate of PRSI payable is 2.35% by the employer with a further 0.9% payable by the employee. The health contribution of 2% may also be payable. The contributions payable by an employee at the modified rate of contribution determines the range of benefits and pensions towards which these contributors can build up entitlement. Subject to having the required number of PRSI contributions, employees who pay Class D contributions can accrue entitlement to the following payments:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1324">a. the widow's/widower's (contributory) pension;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1325">b. the orphan's (contributory) allowance;</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">Contributors insured at PRSI class D are not eligible for social insurance based pensions on retirement. This reflects the reduced rate of social insurance contribution which workers have been paying and the fact that the employments are covered under civil service regulations for occupational pensions. There are no plans at present for a further review of the PRSI position of public and civil servants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1331">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The scheme is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas  and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point to point cross border journeys between here and Northern Ireland.  A new All-Ireland Free Travel scheme will commence on 2nd April 2007.  This scheme will allow seniors (aged 66 or over) resident in the Republic of Ireland to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, seniors (aged 65 or over) in Northern Ireland will travel free on participating services in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">I have raised the issue with Commissioner Spidla and officials from my Department met with European Commission officials on two occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved.  I am keeping this issue under review and contacts with the European Commission are ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1339">There were 5,641 appeals awaiting decisions on 23 February 2006.  Work is in progress in these cases at the various stages of the appeals process.  2,853 of those cases are receiving attention in the Appeals Office, 2,295 in my Department while a further 493 cases are awaiting responses from appellants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">The last year for which figures are available is 2005 when the average length of time taken to deal with all appeals, i.e. those decided summarily and by way of an oral hearing, was 20 weeks on average.  If allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, this average time falls to 13 weeks.  Statistics in respect of 2006 are currently being compiled it is not expected those processing times will vary to any significant extent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission of comments by the Department's Deciding Officers on the grounds for the appeal, further examinations by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain sickness related cases, and the holding of oral hearings which are currently afforded in two out of every three cases determined by Appeals Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">Circumstances can arise, normally outside of the control of the Appeals Office, which can have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals.  For example, delays can occur where the appellant, sometimes at a late stage in the proceedings, furnishes new evidence which requires investigation or where an adjournment may be sought by the appellant or his or her representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">The Social Welfare Appeals Office deals with about 14,000 appeals on an annual basis and the provision of a prompt service remains a major customer service objective and available resources are prioritized to the greatest possible extent so as to achieve the best possible standard of service to its customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">However, the nature of the service provided is quasi-judicial and the procedures in place for determining appeals are designed to ensure that each case receives full and satisfactory consideration.  Consequently, improvements in processing times must be achieved in a manner which is consistent with justice being seen to be done and the need to ensure that every appeal is fully investigated and determined on all its circumstances.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1346">Since taking office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in the Programme for Government aimed specifically at the group. I am very pleased to say that we have delivered on the commitment to increase the State pension to €200 per week by 2007. In addition, the State pension (contributory) has been increased by €16 per week to €209.30 per week. Pension increases have been well ahead of inflation thus ensuring that not only is the real value of pensions maintained but that they are significantly improved in real terms. For instance, since 1996, and including the budget increases, pensions have increased by almost 119%, or about 57% in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">The State pension (non-contributory) is a social assistance scheme which, in common with all other such schemes, features a means test to ensure that resources committed to social assistance payments are used to provide support to and improve the position of those who are most in need. The new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years, which I introduced at the end of September, features significant improvements in the means test and an incentive of €100 per week of earnings disregarded for pensioners who may wish to earn extra income in employment. I was happy to be able to build on these improvements in Budget 2007 by increasing the basic means disregard to €30 per week, and at the same time enhancing the employment incentives by increasing the earnings disregard to €200 per week. Both of these disregards are doubled for pensioner couples.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">Other measures of benefit to older people include last year's increase in the over 80 allowance of €3.60 per week, bringing it to €10 per week and this year's increase in the fuel allowance of €4 per week, bringing the allowance to €18 per week. This represents a doubling of the fuel allowance in the last two years. The household benefits package, which comprises telephone allowance, electricity/natural gas allowance and free TV licence is available to people living in the State aged 66 to 69 years subject to certain conditions, and to over 70s. The electricity/natural gas allowance is of immense benefit to older people who have, in general, greater heating requirements. The value of the natural gas allowance has been increased and the number of free units of electricity increased by 600 units a year to 2,400 units. The household benefits package for a pensioner is currently valued at €985 per year. The free travel scheme, with time restrictions removed and an enhanced All-Ireland package is also of considerable benefit to many pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">The 2005 SILC report published by the CSO, estimates that the level of consistent poverty among older people in 2005 was 3.7% compared to 7% generally. The overall poverty goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2%-4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. Achievement of this goal is already well advanced in the case of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">As the House is aware, the Government is preparing a Green Paper on pensions and it is expected that this will be finalised by the end of this month and published as soon as possible thereafter. The Green Paper will include a discussion of all aspects of our pension system including the contribution that social welfare pensions can make to ensuring an adequate income for older people in retirement which is at the same time sustainable in the long-term. Following the publication of the Green Paper, a consultation process will then take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1353">I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 74 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">The Construction Federation Operatives Pensions Scheme (now known as the Construction Workers Pension Scheme) operates as a registered employment agreement under the Industrial Relations Acts. There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, The Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Pensions Board also has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act is concerned, and there are a number of provisions in the Act relating to the remittance of pension contributions to scheme trustees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">It is important that employees are in a position to monitor the deduction and remittance of their contributions so that any problems in this area will be apparent as early as possible. Accordingly, employers are required to ensure that a statement is issued to employees at least once a month, and to the trustees or the person to whom the employer remits contributions direct, specifying the amount of contributions remitted on their behalf to trustees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">In relation to defined benefit schemes this statement should specify the amount of employee contribution which has been remitted. In relation to defined contribution schemes the statement should specify the amount of both the employee and employer contribution remitted. This disclosure can be made via the payslip. The actual amount remitted during the period to which the statement relates may be specified on the payslip or, alternatively, where the amount of employee deduction and employer contribution which were specified on the previous payslip have since been remitted, a statement to that effect may be included on or with the payslip.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">Employers who deduct pension contributions from employees and who fail to remit these contributions to the scheme trustees are in breach of Section 58A of the Pensions Act. The Pensions Board will investigate all such cases brought to its attention or, alternatively, it is open to a person to make a complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman. The Pensions Ombudsman has, I understand, referred six such cases from the construction sector to the Pensions Board for further investigation and action and these are currently being examined.  The primary aim must be to ensure that the contributions are paid so that pension entitlements are not affected. The Board will also consider prosecuting the employers in such cases where there is sufficient evidence available to support such a prosecution. In 2006, almost a quarter of new investigations initiated during the year related to complaints against employers in the construction industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">In general I am satisfied that the necessary legislation is in place to deal with cases where contributions are not remitted to scheme trustees and that any such cases brought to attention will be fully investigated by the appropriate authorities.  I will, however, keep the matter under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1361">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction of a scheme of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners resident in all parts of the island of Ireland.  I have recently announced the implementation of the all-Ireland free travel scheme commencing from April 2nd which will enable pensioners resident here and in Northern Ireland to travel free of charge on all eligible transport services on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">The scheme will extend the existing cross-border free travel arrangements by allowing pensioners over the age of 66 and resident here to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on transport services in this State.  Some 600,000 customers are in receipt of free travel in the Republic of Ireland, of which 430,000 are aged over 66 years.  The balance of 170,000 free travel recipients are under the age of 66 and so do not qualify for the new scheme. The All-Ireland Free Travel scheme is based on the existence of criteria of entitlements to free travel North and South for pensioners over 66 and applies only to this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">The extension of the scheme to an all Ireland free service for over 66s represents a significant expansion in travel opportunities. I will continue to examine any opportunities to further improve and expand on what will, from April 2nd, be a very comprehensive, seamless free travel scheme. Any such additional developments would have to be worked out in conjunction with the authorities in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">The existing cross-border free travel scheme, introduced in July 1995, continues to apply to all Free Travel Pass holders, to enable them make journeys from a point in the Republic of Ireland to a destination in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1371">Under the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004, a woman may be entitled to statutory minimum maternity leave of 22 weeks.  Regulations provide that this is increased to 26 weeks where maternity leave commences from 1 March 2007.  Membership of an occupational pension scheme must continue while she is on statutory maternity leave. A member of a defined benefit scheme will continue to accrue pensionable service during the period of this statutory leave. If the employer pays the woman during the statutory maternity leave, she may be required to continue paying employee contributions to the scheme, as appropriate, whether a defined benefit or defined contribution scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">If a woman takes additional maternity leave above the statutory minimum and is paid by her employer during this period, her membership of the pension scheme will also continue. However, if she takes additional unpaid maternity leave, then whether or not she continues to accrue retirement benefit depends on the rules of the particular scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">In relation to social welfare pensions a PRSI credit is awarded for each week of unpaid maternity leave up to a maximum of 16 weeks and these are reckonable for the purpose of determining entitlement to State contributory pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">The requirements in relation to continuing membership of occupational pension schemes support the statutory provisions for maternity leave and I consider that this is a reasonable approach. In the circumstances, I have no plans to increase obligations on employers in this area. However, the matter will be kept under review.</p>

         if there will be changes to the criteria to qualify for the back to education allowance in view of the fact that the qualifying age limits militates against young mothers.

            <p eId="para_1376">The back to education allowance (BTEA) is designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force. It is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage those who have been out of education to return to education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">The BTEA is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">At present, to qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be at least 21 years of age (18 for people with disabilities).  However lone parents and others may access the scheme at 18 years if they are out of formal education for 2 years or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.  The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">The eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme are considered reasonable and necessary in order to ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">The granting of a special concession to young mothers to access the BTEA scheme would have to have general application on grounds of equity to all unemployed people and people with disabilities.  This would have significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.  Such a change would also have implications for other schemes requiring a similar attachment to a relevant social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">The provision of support for young mothers to stay in education is primarily a matter that should be addressed through the education system.  With regard to first chance education, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science has already in place a number of programmes for young mothers wishing to stay in education i.e. the home tuition scheme, the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) and youthreach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that my Department's back to education allowance scheme continues to support those who are most distant from the labour market, including young mothers.  The scheme is kept under regular review to ensure that it continues to support those most in need.</p>

            <p eId="para_1385">Two important pieces of work have recently been completed regarding different types of partner relationships and how they should be treated and recognised in Irish society. The first report an ‘Options Paper, presented by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership' to the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, focuses on different types of cohabiting relationships, both same and opposite sex, and presents a range of options with regard to giving legal recognition to these relationships. Officials from my Department contributed to the work of this Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">The second report — the ‘Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants' — makes substantial recommendations for reform of the law concerning cohabitants including both opposite sex or same sex couples who live together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">These reports come at a time of wide public debate on the question of according legal status to cohabitants generally, and same sex couples in particular, and will contribute to the informed debate on these important topics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">In addition, my own Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended).  The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">This work, together with the reports I have referred to, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1393">I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 182 and 183 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">My Department operates two main types of pension scheme — contributory and non-contributory payments. Contributory payments are paid on the basis of social insurance contributions made over a person's working life. Missionaries who have made sufficient social insurance contributions can qualify for the state pension (contributory). These pensions are payable abroad and so missionaries who qualify and who choose to settle overseas can receive a payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Non-contributory pensions are only payable where a person is resident in this country. Accordingly, missionaries who return here and who satisfy the habitual residence condition and a means test can qualify for a pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The question of paying pensions to missionaries who remain abroad was first raised in the context of a submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs by the Irish Missionary Union. The Union estimates that there are some 1,800 missionaries serving abroad, including about 1,000 who are already over pension age. Subsequently, officials of my Department made a presentation to the Committee on the issue. Following that presentation, the Chairperson of the Committee decided to establish a working group to look at the issues raised in more detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">The Department prepared a report on the issues in question in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and submitted this to the Committee. The report examines the question of pensions for missionaries and the wider issue of social insurance for volunteer development workers in general. The Committee requested that certain matters in the report be examined further and this is at present being done in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is expected that this process will be completed shortly and the results will be communicated to the Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">With regard to claims for state pension (non-contributory) from missionaries returning here on a temporary basis, the position is that such claims are subject to the habitual residence condition. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. The application of the habitual residence condition has to be compatible with EU law and other international and national legal obligations and it is not possible in applying the condition to discriminate in favour of any particular group or nationality. Accordingly, it is not possible to waive the requirement in respect of Irish missionaries who return home on temporary visits. Missionaries retiring here permanently are deemed to satisfy this condition.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1400">EU migrant workers have an entitlement to Child Benefit and other "Family benefits" including Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) under EU Regulation 1408/71. Where a national of an EU State is working in Ireland, the worker is entitled to payment of such benefits, even if the children are resident in the worker's home country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">Applications for family benefits from EU migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation. Entitlement to Child Benefit is based on the applicant satisfying the Habitual Residency condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">Currently there are over 34,000 EU nationals in receipt of Child Benefit for 61,000 children who are resident with them in Ireland. Of these recipients, some 16,500 are UK nationals, with a further 13,500 recipients from the ten States that joined the EU in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71. Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">This process can take a number of months to complete and, as a result, the number of claims that has been finalised to date is relatively small. There are approximately 15,000 claims at various stages of processing and awaiting finalisation. The number of claims to Child Benefit and potentially Early Child Supplement in respect of non resident children of EU nationals has, since the start of 2006, averaged about 300 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">Child Benefit is in payment under EU regulations to 680 families, in respect of 1625 children resident outside of the Republic of Ireland. Some 87% of these children are resident in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">The child benefit expenditure for EU migrants with non resident children in respect of 2007 will depend on a number of factors which are difficult to determine until the claims in question are finalised. Assuming, however, that the claims received have full entitlement including arrears, and that the current trend in new claims being received continues, it is estimated that expenditure on these claims would be around €85m or 3.9% of overall child benefit expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">The total cost in 2008 is also difficult to estimate but on a similar basis and on current trends, the potential accrued cost could be of the order of €130m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">The estimates in respect of early childcare supplement are €27m in respect of 2007 and €30m in respect of 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1413">Pneumoconiosis is a prescribed disease for the purpose of the Occupational Injuries scheme administered by my Department.  The legislation governing the Occupational Injuries Scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">Employment under a contract of service is insurable for Occupational Injuries Benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Persons who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim.  If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive Disability Benefit or Invalidity Pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">Persons may be entitled to Disablement Benefit if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work.  Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">Persons claiming Occupational Injuries Benefit in cases of Pneumoconiosis are referred to Consultant Respiratory Physicians in the first instance for an examination and report.  This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing (PFT).  Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's report, including the pulmonary function test result.  The degree of disablement is expressed as a percentage of loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">Loss of faculty may be determined within a range of less than 1% to 100%, depending on the severity of the condition.  There are 22 persons currently in receipt of disablement benefit as a result of contracting pneumoconiosis arising from their occupation, of which 19 are former miners. The percentage of disablement assessed ranges from 8% to 90%.  A person must be assessed as having a minimum of 20% loss of faculty before they may be considered as being incapable of work due to their disablement.  A person in receipt of disablement benefit may at any time request a review of their award.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">The arrangements which apply to pneumoconiosis under the occupational injuries scheme are in line with practice elsewhere and there are no plans at present to change those arrangements.  My officials will be glad to meet with representatives of the group involved to discuss any concerns in relation to the present arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1421">My Department aims to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.  The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">My Department takes a pro-active approach in advertising its schemes and services by using a mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, factsheets, posters, direct mailshots, advertising on television screens in over 60 Credit Unions nationwide, and by distributing information booklets to health centres throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">National advertising campaigns are undertaken periodically to promote greater awareness of a specific scheme or to highlight changes in schemes and services.  The following campaigns were undertaken in 2006:</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">In March, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign to promote and encourage take up of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  There was an increase of 82% in new claims and 32.5% in renewals for the period March to December 2006 compared with the same period in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">In August, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance was advertised in national and regional newspapers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">During the last week of September, an information campaign was conducted on television, on national and local radio and in national and regional newspapers to raise public awareness of the Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit and the Respite Care Grant schemes designed to provide supports for carers.  This campaign proved very successful with, for example, an increase from 2005 to 2006 of 70% in the number of Respite Care grants issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">My Department's PRSI information emailing service was advertised in the business supplements of the national newspapers in late November/early December.  Early notification, by email, of PRSI changes such as Budget Information is provided to those who register their email addresses on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">As part of the Budget awareness campaign, as in previous years, advertisements were placed in the national and regional newspapers in December listing phone numbers, including a Budget Freephone number, which customers could contact to receive information on changes in the various social welfare schemes and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">The first targeted advertising campaign of 2007 has been conducted over the last two weeks regarding All Ireland Free Travel.   The All Ireland Free Travel Scheme will enable citizens aged 66 or over to travel free within Northern Ireland with effect from the 2nd of April, 2007.   Advertisements informing older people of their entitlements in this regard have been published in Sunday, National and Provincial newspapers and will be included in the next edition of the Senior Times magazine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">A LoCall helpline (1890 66 22 44) is provided for all campaigns.  In addition to the LoCall number, the campaigns also highlight other sources of information available to the public, including my Department's website (www.welfare.ie), and my Department's network of Social Welfare Local Offices and the information services available through the network of Citizens Information Centres, including the Citizen Information phone service and website facility (www.citizeninformation.ie). The responses to the campaigns have been encouraging and resulted in increases in the number of applications received for the various schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">In view of the range of services available from my Department it would not be possible to highlight all of them in a single advertising campaign.  Therefore, nationwide targeted advertising campaigns, focusing on specific schemes and services, will continue to be a key priority for me in the drive to ensure that citizens are aware of and claim their social welfare entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">Homeless people have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen under the social welfare system. If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for job seekers allowance. A person makes a claim to job seekers allowance by completing a claim form at the Department's local office. Homeless people can be paid basic allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme if they do not fulfil the conditions for any other primary weekly payment from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">In addition, they can also apply for payments such as rent supplement, diet supplement and exceptional needs payments. In order to claim any payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a person should contact their local community welfare officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation. In excess of 8,800 rent deposits were paid out under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in 2006 at a cost of some €4.7 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Homelessness is one of the major problems facing our society and the Government is committed to addressing it in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner. Substantial progress is being made under the Government's strategy on adult homelessness, in addressing the needs of people who are homeless and in assisting them to move to accommodation that is suitable to their needs. This has been done through the recognition that a solution to homelessness is not just about the provision of housing or shelter and that there is a need for a comprehensive approach involving health, care and welfare, education, training and support, as well as accommodation, to enable homeless persons to re-integrate into society and to prevent others from becoming homeless.</p>

            <p eId="para_1442">A person who is in receipt of a social welfare payment may claim an increase in respect of a dependent spouse or partner.  This increase, known as the Qualified Adult Allowance (QAA), is normally paid as a single amount with the primary payment to the claimant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">In recent years the question of paying the QAA direct to the adult dependant has been raised in a number of reports, the intention being to provide the dependant with a level of economic freedom.  Significant changes have been made in the social welfare code, over the years to ensure as many people as possible qualify for a social welfare payment in their own right.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">The qualifying conditions for a pension have been significantly eased, for example through reducing the minimum yearly average of contributions required to qualify for a pension and the introduction of homemaker credits for the benefit of people of working age engaged in home duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">In the case of the State pensions (non-contributory) (SPn/c), the means of the couple are jointly assessed and where both are over the age 66, each receives a pension in his/her own right.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">I am aware that, while the situation of people qualifying for pensions in their own right has increased, there is still a large number of adults dependent on their spouses' social welfare payment for support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">In October 2002, my Department introduced arrangements to pay the QAA on request to the spouse or partner of new claimants of State Pension (contributory) (SPC) or State pension (Transition) (SPT).  Since these arrangements were introduced, some 1,400 couples have indicated their preference to have the QAA paid separately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">In the Budget of December 2006, I announced significant improvements in the rate of payment for qualified adults on State pensions and important changes in the way these payments will be made in the future.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment "to introduce a personal pension entitlement for pensioner spouses currently in receipt of the qualified adult allowance," and the changes introduced in this budget mark a significant step in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Following the changes announced in the Budget, new qualified adults will receive their portion of the pension direct.  However, customers who wish to be paid their pension jointly will be able to opt for joint payment.  The revised arrangements will apply to all new applicants for SPT, SPC and SPn/c with effect from September 2007.  Operational arrangements for this initiative are currently being developed in my Department and will be finalised in advance of the implementation date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The position regarding people of working age is less straight forward and separate payment may be appropriate for certain schemes.  I am having this matter kept under review in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1452">The purpose of the review of the social welfare code, which is currently being undertaken in my Department, is to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended). The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act — gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, disability, religion, age, race and membership of the Traveller community — that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">A decision was taken after considerable background work and consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the review would take place in two phases. Phase 1 involved the undertaking of a scoping exercise to establish the most appropriate approach and methodology to carrying out the main review, which would be robust and verifiable. That exercise, which was carried out by consultants following a tendering process, is now complete. My Department has taken the decision that the main review should be put out to tender. The request for tender document is currently being prepared using the material produced in Phase 1 as the basis for the terms of reference of the review. It is anticipated that the request for tender for the Review will be placed on the Government e-tender website and in the Official Journal of the European Union later this month.</p>

            <p eId="para_1455">Comparisons with pensioner incomes in other countries can be difficult because of the different ways in which Governments provide for older people and because of different demographic, economic and social situations in each country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The following table, prepared by the EU Commission, compares the median equivalised income of people aged 65 and over with the general population under 65 in each of the EU Member States. The figures range from 55% to 113% with Ireland at 62%. In evaluating the relative position of pensioners, only monetary income (notably deriving from the pensions system) is taken into account. The wealth of pensioners, in particular home ownership and private savings, which have a strong impact on the income distribution of pensioners, is not taken into account. Non-monetary benefits such as free healthcare and transport are also excluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The information set out in the table derives from the EU synthesis report on adequate and sustainable pensions for 2006 and is largely based on EU SILC 2004 which refers to income data for 2003. Since then pensions in Ireland have increased by 33% in the case of contributory pensions and 39% for non-contributory pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The Government is concerned about the adequacy of retirement income and, as the House will be aware, a major review of our pensions system was published in 2006 by the Pensions Board together with a report on possible options for a mandatory pensions system. The Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 and future pensions policy will now be examined in that context. The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">The two reports completed by the Pensions Board are significant inputs to the Green Paper. It is expected that it will be finalised by the end of March and published as quickly as possible thereafter. In line with Towards 2016, a consultation process will follow the publication of the Green Paper and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1514">My Department, together with the Department of Finance, is managing a programme of work to develop a Public Service Card framework. The programme of work is known as SAFE — Standard Authentication Framework Environment. The term "framework" is being used to emphasise that a single Public Service Card is not envisaged but rather a branded standard within which individual initiatives can operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">My Department is developing Public Service Cards, based on the SAFE standards, which will replace the existing Social Welfare Card with a view to issuance commencing in 2007. The provisions in the Bill referred to by the Deputy provide the necessary statutory basis for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">One of the objectives of SAFE is to facilitate convergence over time of existing cards and other tokens under a single branded scheme. The individual customer will benefit from a reduction in the number of tokens required and from enhanced control of the use of their data. Agencies can benefit from the streamlining of existing schemes and sharing of administrative costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">In July 2005, the SAFE Interdepartmental Steering Group reported to the Government. The Government noted the work of the SAFE Programme up to that point, which included a set of standards around a Public Service Card, and approved continuation of the work. In November 2005, the Department invited proposals for the development of a functional specification for a Public Services card and subsequently awarded a contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">The present position is that a draft functional specification for the public service card itself has been drawn up and is being discussed with other Departments. It is planned to go to tender for card production in March with a view to card issuance towards the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">The first version of the card will be deployed for use among the 640,000 people eligible for Free Travel and will introduce a number of improvements, including an improved registration process along with new card technology, which will bring improved customer service and better security features, considerably reducing the potential for forgery and fraudulent use.</p>

            <p eId="para_1521">Family income supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family's net earnings and the number of children under age 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">FIS is designed to encourage people to take up or remain in full-time work in the open labour market in circumstances where dependency on social welfare alone may otherwise appear attractive. Extension of entitlement to people engaged in training courses would not be consistent with these policy objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_1524">Child benefit can be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the State. Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education, or disabled and incapable of self-support. The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and since 1 May 2004, the qualified person must satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">EU Regulations provide that migrant workers who are EEA nationals, i.e. EEA nationals who have been employed or self-employed since coming to this country, or receiving Irish Jobseeker's benefit, are entitled to payment of family benefits in respect of their families who reside in another Member State. In these circumstances the family members are treated as if they are habitually resident in Ireland for the purpose of Child Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">For the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 January 2007, the number of child benefit claims that required particular examination of the habitual residence condition was 16,092. Of these only 1,557 (less than 10%) were disallowed.  Those who are refused are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, who do not have a work permit or who have only a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">I am satisfied that the habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose, allowing access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State. I have therefore no plans to remove the habitual residence condition.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1531">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 93 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">In keeping with the approach taken in the original 1997 National Anti-Poverty Strategy, the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) adopts a coordinated approach across a range of policy areas. This reflects the complex nature of poverty and social exclusion, which is multi-faceted in both its causes and effects. The Plan, building on the lifecycle approach adopted in the social partnership agreement, ‘Towards 2016', and complemented by the social inclusion elements of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP), assesses the risks which individuals face at each stage of the lifecycle and the supports they need to meet these risks. The lifecycle stages are children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities, and there is also a specific related section on supports for communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">The overall poverty goal in the Plan is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. The Plan also identifies 12 high level strategic goals in certain key priority areas in order to mobilise resources to address long-standing and serious social deficits to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty. The high level goals, which also form part of the NDP, are accompanied by over 150 more detailed targets and actions across all stages of the lifecycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">In order to ensure effective implementation of these targets and actions the NAPinclusion provides for a comprehensive and efficient monitoring and reporting process, the key element of which will be the preparation by the Office for Social Inclusion, based in my Department, of an annual Social Inclusion Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">To ensure that the NAPinclusion is effectively implemented at a local level, the Local Government Social Inclusion Steering Group will be further developed to support the linkages between both the national and local level and will report on progress to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">Local partnership structures will be strengthened over the lifetime of the Plan. Of key importance will be the need to promote linkages, cohesion and sharing of resources between local and community development agencies. Any new measures in this area will affirm the role of the County/City Development Boards as the key co-ordinating bodies for public service delivery at local level and the means of ensuring more joined-up delivery of social inclusion programmes on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">Specific actions to strengthen implementation at local level include the extension of Social Inclusion Units to half of all city and county councils by the end of 2008. It also includes the enhancement and strengthening of the RAPID programme which provides direct State assistance towards improving quality of life and access to opportunities for communities in the most disadvantaged urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">The resources for meeting most of the objectives for the NAPinclusion will be allocated in the annual Budgetary context especially for the mainstream services such as social welfare, employment supports, education, health, care services and transport. There is a total investment of €50 billion provided for social inclusion measures in the NDP.  This investment will fund many of the elements contained in the NAPinclusion. Investment under other areas of the NDP is also significant from a poverty and social inclusion perspective. These include over €21 billion for housing; €5 billion for investment in health services; €5 billion in schools development and €13 billion in higher education; €2 billion for sport and culture; €4.9 billion for targeted training and supports to groups outside the labour market; €2.9 billion for training and up skilling for people in employment, for improvements in the apprenticeship system and for the  provision of  opportunities for school leavers; and a €90 million investment in expanding the Rural Transport Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">Taken together with the NDP and Towards 2016, I believe that the NAPinclusion represents a coherent and ambitious strategy that will make a decisive impact on poverty over the next 10 years greater than for any previous comparable period and that will deliver real improvements in living standards and well being for those most vulnerable in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1541">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. There are currently 21,971 people in receipt of FIS. In Budget 2007, I have continued the re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The reasons for the perceived lack of take-up of FIS have been the subject of significant Parliamentary and other enquiry. In response, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign in March 2006 to promote and encourage increased take up of the scheme for working families on low incomes. This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press.  A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.  As a result, the take up of FIS was substantially improved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">The second element to address FIS take up issues is the proposed commissioning of a specific research project to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">Tenders to undertake this work have been received by my Department and these are being evaluated. I expect this process to be concluded shortly and the project to commence in the next few weeks.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_543">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1546">In keeping with the approach taken in the original 1997 National Anti-Poverty Strategy, the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) adopts a coordinated approach across a range of policy areas, reflecting the complex nature of poverty and social exclusion, which is multi-faceted in its causes and effects. The Plan, building on the lifecycle approach adopted in the social partnership agreement, ‘Towards 2016', and complemented by the social inclusion elements of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP), assesses the risks which individuals face at each stage of the lifecycle and the supports they need to meet these risks. Older people are specifically identified as one of the key life stages in the lifecycle approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">The vision in the Plan for older people is two fold. Income support will be provided and increased at least in real terms to ensure an adequate standard of living. Supports will be provided and further developed to enable them maintain their health and well-being, as well as to live active and full lives in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">The high level goals for older people focus on these two areas. The Plan states that investment in community care services for older people will continue to increase, including home care packages and enhanced day care services. The minimum payment rate of €200 per week, in 2007 terms, for all social welfare pensions will be maintained over the course of this Plan and, if possible, enhanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">The overall poverty goal in the Plan is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. The Government in setting the new poverty reduction target has accepted the advice of the ESRI to use an updated set of deprivation indicators, which focus to a greater degree on items reflecting social inclusion and participation in society. This will see the current measure, based on lacking one or more items from an 8-item index, changing to one based on lacking two or more items from an 11-item index. This revised set of indicators will be used to measure consistent poverty over the course of the new NAPinclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">The rate of consistent poverty for older people at just below 4 per cent is lower than that for people of working age at 5.9%. Reasons for this include the fact that older people:</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">experience lower housing costs;</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">benefit from the value of non cash benefits;</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">are more likely to be able to draw on accumulated resources; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">are particularly likely to enjoy support from family members.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">The "at risk of poverty" indicator used by the EU does not measure poverty as such, but rather the numbers in households with incomes below 60% of median income, who are deemed to be at risk of poverty. This does not take into account the other resources or access to resources that people have. In the case of older people that would include the benefits flowing from their high level of home ownership, which is much higher than in many other developed countries. It also does not take into account the access older people have to a wide range of services that greatly improve their standard of living and well being.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">Neither does the headline "at risk of poverty" threshold reflect the degree to which the incomes of older people are below the threshold. In 2005, of those older people classified as at risk of poverty only 7.2%, or a third, had incomes below the 50% threshold, with the majority having incomes just below the 60% threshold. Taken together with the fact that just 3.7% are classified as being at risk of poverty, the "at risk of poverty" indicator currently gives a misleading impression of the extent of poverty among older people in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">However, allowing for the difficulties with this indicator, the percentage of older people classified as at risk of poverty dropped a full 7 points from 27.1% in 2004 to 20.1% in 2005. This shows, in particular, the impact of the increased provision made for pensioners in recent years. This impact was measured, of course, before account could be taken of the major increases in pensions provided for in Budgets 2006 and 2007. Budget 2007 delivered on our commitment in the Programme for Government to bring the basic State Pension to €200 a week, in addition to a range of other benefits available to our senior citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The effect of the significant improvements made in pension provision can be best illustrated by the fact that since 1996 pensions have increased by almost 119% or about 57% in real terms. In addition to these improvements, the means test for the State Pension (non-contributory) has been further relaxed by €10 per week to €30 and the earnings disregard, which was introduced last year to encourage pensioners who may wish to earn extra income to continue in employment, has been doubled from €100 to €200 a week for non-contributory pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">The levels of increases provided in Budgets 2006 and 2007, in conjunction with the strategy set out in the NAPinclusion, demonstrates the Government's continuing commitment to safeguard and enhance the living standards of older people, and to provide them with a fair share of the fruits of our high levels of economic growth, which they have done so much to bring about during their working lives.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1561">The purpose of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">In recent years the numbers claiming the supplement have grown considerably from 42,683 in 2000 to 59,861 at the end of December 2006 with corresponding scheme expenditure rising from €151m to €389m in the same period.   The scheme has also witnessed an increase in the duration of entitlement with over 30,000 recipients now getting a supplement for 18 months or more.   While a broad range of housing supports are provided by local authorities, including the more recent Rental Accommodation Scheme, aimed exclusively at those on rent supplement for more than 18 months and regarded as having long-term housing need, I am anxious that all avenues are explored to provide financial support for any people on long-term rent supplementation who may be in a position to purchase their own home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">In this regard a study was commissioned from Goodbody Economic Consultants to examine the potential of supplementing home ownership specifically among the client base that comes within the rent supplementation arrangements. The study, overseen by officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government, was aimed at identifying possible viable alternative approaches to meeting housing needs for long-term rent supplement recipients. These would be in addition or complimentary to the range of social housing options currently provided for by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government through local government initiatives. People in this category are primarily dependent on social welfare payments and would not be in position to purchase private property at going market rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">Since initiating the study, a number of significant developments have been announced including improvements to the rent supplement scheme in Budget 2007 which —</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">allow for the continuation of rent supplement to qualified persons moving into full-time employment while local authorities are sourcing accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS),  and</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">an improvement in the disregards applying to additional income in the assessment of means for rent supplement purposes.  At present up to €60 and 50% of additional income between €60 and €90 is disregarded in the assessment of means for rent supplement purposes.  I am providing for the necessary legislative provisions to give effect to these Budget improvements in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill currently before the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">Another development includes proposals by the Minister for the Department of Environment Heritage and local Government to introduce an ‘incremental purchase' scheme for social housing tenants and prospective tenants based on the development of the ‘shared equity' concept whereby tenants would be allowed to use their rental payments to build up an equity stake in a local authority house in an incremental fashion in return for paying a premium on the rent and taking over responsibility for the maintenance of the dwelling. The objective is to make it possible for households with incomes substantially lower than for affordable housing to start on the path to home ownership. This scheme is outlined in the recent Statement on Housing Policy "Delivering Homes and Sustaining Communities."</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">The findings of the draft report are being considered having regard to the range of initiatives in the area of housing policy generally and taking on board these latest improvements.   While I will be examining the report, it is not my intention that the rent supplement scheme as it is currently framed will be changed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">Since taking Office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in the Programme for Government aimed specifically at this group. These included a commitment to raise the qualified adult increase for the spouses and partners (age 66 or over) of contributory pensioners to the level of the State pension (non-contributory).  Spouses and partners of non-contributory pensioners may receive a pension in their own right at age 66.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">To this end, Budget 2007 provided for an increase of €23.70 per week in the qualified adult payment where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over, bringing it up to a maximum rate of €173 per week. This measure benefited some 35,500 couples. The new maximum rate is 86.5% of the target rate contained in the Government commitment. It is my intention to complete the process of aligning the rates in question within three years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1579">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Tullow Garda Station on 27 February, 2007 was 9 (all ranks). Tullow Garda Station forms part of the Baltinglass District. The personnel strength of the Baltinglass District on 31 December, 1997 and 27 February, 2007 (all ranks) was 49 and 62 respectively. This represents an increase of 13 (or 26.5%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">The Garda authorities state that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Bagenalstown Garda Station and Ballon Garda Station on 27 February, 2007 was 7 and 1, respectively. Bagenalstown and Ballon Garda Stations form part of the Carlow District. The personnel strength of the Carlow District on 31 December, 1997 and 27 February, 2007 (all ranks) was 68 and 95 respectively. This represents an increase of 27 (or 39.7%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.  Local Garda management state that they are satisfied that the resources currently allocated to Bagenalstown, Tullow and Ballon Garda Stations in the Carlow/Kildare Division are adequate to meet the present policing needs of those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available I know that the Garda Commissioner will take full account of the needs of the Carlow/Kildare Garda Division in his allocation of the very considerable increase currently under way in the strength of the Force.</p>

            <p eId="para_1617">As the Deputy will be aware, separate arrangements exist in respect of Criminal and Civil Legal Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  The sum of €43.503m has been allocated for this purpose in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">An accused person is entitled to be informed by the court in which he/she is appearing of his/her possible right to legal aid.  The grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of his/her defence or appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">The courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid him/herself.  In this regard, an applicant for free legal aid may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">Furthermore, the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">My Department has no involvement in the granting of free criminal legal aid or assignment of lawyers.  These matters are handled entirely by the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">In so far as Civil Legal Aid is concerned, the position is that the Legal Aid Board provides legal advice and assistance, including Refugee Legal Services, mainly through the solicitors it employs on a full-time basis in its law centre network nationwide.  The sum of €24.288m has been allocated to the Legal Aid Board for 2007 and the sum of €9.117m has been allocated to Refugee Legal Services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1632">Civil Servants appointed prior to April 1995 pay a modified rate of Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) and are not eligible for most Social Welfare benefits, including the Old Age Contributory Pension (OACP). Their personal  pension entitlements are met entirely from the Civil Service (occupational) Pension Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">All staff (with minor exceptions) appointed or reappointed as established civil servants on  or after 6th April 1995 are full Class A PRSI contributors. As such they are entitled to the full range of Social Welfare benefits. Their civil service retirement benefits are integrated with the OACP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">The introduction of "integrated pensions" in 1995 was designed in such a way as to ensure that the combination of personal Social Welfare and civil service pension benefits was at least as favourable as the civil service benefits payable to pre 1995 appointees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">Any officer who received a marriage gratuity as a result of the "marriage bar" and who was subsequently re-appointed as an established civil servant is entitled to have all of the earlier service reckoned for civil service pension purposes subject to repayment of the gratuity with appropriate compound interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">A person whose reappointment was prior to 1995 would, on retirement, receive a civil service pension and lump-sum calculated by reference to salary and length of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">In the case of persons reappointed after 1 April 1995 the civil service retirement lump sum would be calculated on the same basis as above. Civil service pension would be calculated by reference to length of service but by reference to "integrated salary" i.e. salary less twice the personal rate of OACP. However, when aggregated with OACP entitlements, the total pension payable would be at least equal to, and in many cases greater than, the pension payable to a comparable pre 1995 appointee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">I would not accept therefore that the occupational pension entitlements of persons re-appointed after 1995 are less favourable than those of persons appointed or reappointed prior to that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">The existing Social Welfare entitlements of a retiring officer who is in full PRSI and who is in receipt of a Social Welfare Spouse's pension prior to retirement are subject to review where the person is entitled also to receive an OACP following retirement. In these circumstances the officer is entitled to one Social Welfare benefit payment only and is awarded the greater of the benefits. This is a feature of the Social Insurance system and applies to all individuals covered by full PRSI. I would not accept that it is an anomaly situation affecting women who resigned from the civil service on marriage but who were reappointed to the civil service subsequent to 1995.</p>

The 39 hours per week is considered to be reasonably representative having regard to the variety of arrangements which exist across employments.  Such an approach would give rise to annualised figures for the minimum wage of €16,832 for the rate which has applied from 1 January 2007 and €17,542 for the rate which will apply from 1 July 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1721">As the bulk of taxpayers are in the PAYE sector, it is assumed that the changes mentioned by the Deputy are to be applied with employees primarily in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">On this basis, and assuming the enactment of the changes announced in the 2007 Budget, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year costs to the Exchequer of ensuring that no tax is paid by single persons earning up to 20,000 euro per annum and married two-earner couples earning up to 40,000 euro could be achieved by an increase of 480 euro in the aggregate annual value of the basic personal tax credits.  Such an increase would cost in the region of  880 million euro in a full year if achieved through an increase in the value of the basic personal tax credit, or about 600 million euro if achieved through an increase in the value of the employee (PAYE) tax credit or about 740 million euro if achieved though increases of equal value, that is, 240 euro each, in both the basic personal credit and the employee credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">The increases mentioned in the question are assumed to apply in similar measure to widowed persons and to include the normal consequential increases in the tax credit for lone parents and the married tax credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">If the intention is also to ensure that married one-earner couples would pay no tax on income up to 40,000 euro this would cost significantly more to achieve.  Of course, if such a position were to apply, it would be the case that single earners and married two-earners would then be exempt from tax on income amounts in excess of 20,000 euro and 40,000 euro, respectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_1726">The stamp duty code favours first-time owner-occupying purchasers.  First-time buyers of new residential property are exempt from stamp duty where the property has a floor size of 125 square metres or less and where they occupy the property.  Where the floor size of new properties is greater than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value at the current rates applying to second-hand residential properties or on 25% of the value of the property, excluding VAT — whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">In terms of second-hand residential property, first-time buyers are exempt from stamp duty on properties valued at €317,500 or less and pay reduced rates on property valued up to €635,000.  The generous stamp duty reliefs in place for first-time buyers are designed to assist affordability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that first-time buyers are identifiable where they have qualified for the first-time buyer relief and paid stamp duty at a lower rate than other buyers. As current stamp duty rates for property transactions exceeding €635,000 are the same for all residential purchasers, it is not possible to distinguish first time buyer transactions in excess of these values.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">Based on figures of 2006 outturn the full year cost to the Exchequer of abolishing stamp duty for all first time buyers who can be identified is estimated at €66 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_1733">The current rate of Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) is €250 per quarter or €1,000 for a full year.  While the cost of doubling the rate of the ECS would depend on a number of factors, including the effective date, future claim loads and the processing of backdated claims, it is considered reasonable to assume that a doubling of the rate of the ECS would also double its full year cost to the Exchequer.   The Revised Estimates Volume shows an estimated 2007 spend of €406m.  If this was doubled, the cost to the Exchequer would be more than €800m.</p>

            <p eId="para_1736">The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of €575 million for the 5 year period of 2006 to 2010.  The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, the aim of which is to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education. Unlike the EOCP, the NCIP is completely Exchequer funded.  The NCIP is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare.  Childcare places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">Of the €575 million total budget for the NCIP, some €357 million is earmarked for capital investment and to provide for the cost of meeting the programme's target of 50,000 additional childcare places. Capital grant applications under the NCIP are assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant's capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality childcare, and furthermore, community projects are expected to have a focus on disadvantage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1746">The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled "A Vision for Change", was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders,  the further development of primary and community care services and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">In 2006, a sum of €26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with  "A Vision for Change".  A further sum of €25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development. €0.75 million of this additional funding is for the initial development of a dedicated eating disorder service in each HSE area through a combination of reconfiguring existing services and commissioning services from agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1750">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1762">An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar General) is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland, including civil marriages. I have made enquiries with an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the position is as follows.  The Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the commencement of the various provisions of the Act on a gradual basis. Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, were commenced on 5th December 2005.  The new provisions for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the 2004 Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriage ceremonies, provided for under section 52 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">Before the provisions can be commenced by statutory instrument, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced in the Act. Work in all these areas is underway and is progressing well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">In view of the number of complex tasks involved in preparing for the commencement of the marriage provisions, it is not possible to be definitive as regards a date for signing commencement orders. However an tArd-Chláraitheoir is aiming to have this work completed by July 2007. It is intended to give as much public notice as possible and a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1766">In 2005, a process was begun to examine all aspects of the drugs supply chain with a view to achieving greater value for money in the pricing and supply of drugs and medicines to the health services and the GMS and community drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply. This process was agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children negotiating team was put in place to advance this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">During discussions with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributors' Federation (PDF), as part of the agreed process, PDF advised the State that a legal issue precluded it from negotiating a new margin for distribution to community pharmacies.  The negotiating team then obtained legal advice, which subsequent legal advice to the Department confirmed, that this issue also had implications for negotiations with community pharmacists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">The legal advice to the Minister and the HSE indicates that:</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">Section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the restriction or distortion of competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions. Those conditions are not met in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings under Section 4(1) of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4(1).</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">Entering into an agreement, making a decision or being involved in a concerted practice in contravention of Section 4(1) is a criminal offence and would expose those parties, their directors, managers and officers to the risk of criminal prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">In light of the above, it is not possible for the State to engage in negotiations with PDF or the IPU in relation to fees or margins.  Accordingly, the HSE wrote to all community pharmacy contractors, setting out the position in relation to these issues in detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">The negotiating team has been examining how best to address this issue for pharmacy contractor services.  To this end, the team engaged with the IPU to clarify the legal position and the situation in relation to contract negotiations.  Following discussions, the IPU has agreed to a process to examine ways of carrying out a contract review that would comply fully with competition law.  It is expected that this process, subject to completion of the necessary arrangements, will begin shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1778">The Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity — Obesity the Policy Challenges — was published in 2005 and contained 93 recommendations aimed at tackling overweight and obesity.  These recommendations relate to actions across six broad sectors: high-level government; education; social and community; health; food, commodities, production and supply; and the physical environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The Taskforce recognises that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary, involving other state agencies and government departments and real engagement of the public and private sectors to implement all of the report's recommendations.  My Department is currently finalising proposals for the development of a mechanism which will facilitate inter-sectoral working on the prevention of chronic diseases including obesity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">The Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement the health sector recommendations of the Task Force on Obesity for which the HSE has the lead responsibility and for which €3 million has been allocated.  In 2006 eight additional posts focused on obesity were secured and a number of new initiatives commenced and are continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">In relation to the surveillance and monitoring of obesity, funding has been provided by the HSE to UCD, to record height and weight in children at school entry point as part of the Lifeways cohort.  The development of a national database to monitor prevalence trends of growth, overweight and obesity was also funded.  The HSE is working with the Irish Universities Nutritional Alliance, to research food and nutrition in children and its determinants.  Funding was also allocated to the Irish Heart Foundation to progress the Action for Life physical activity programme and to undertake a project on marketing of foods to children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">National Guidelines for community based practitioners on prevention and management of childhood overweight and obesity were published and launched in December.  Training for primary and community based practitioners on patient centred skills in addressing overweight and obesity was also funded.  New growth charts for children were developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The Health Service Executive is working with the Community Games Association to integrate Health Promotion as a strategic priority in their strategic plan.  This plan addresses Nutrition and physical Activity as well as other key health promotion topics.  The partnership with the Education Sector is progressing.  The HSE has also developed a strategic alliance with the Irish Sports Council, and have part-funded the Local Sports Partnerships to promote Physical Activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">In order to determine precise costs of obesity to the health sector and to the economy as a whole, a great deal of primary research would need to be undertaken.  However, the TaskForce report estimated the obesity-related treatment cost to the healthcare system in 2002 was €70m.  The TaskForce point out that there is a danger that focusing on the public finance costs or the output lost obscures the fundamental point that the real loss is the premature death.  With this in mind, I am pleased that my Department and the HSE are moving forward with initiatives to prevent obesity and, where necessary, to treat the range of associated illnesses.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1786">Medical cards are made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">The HSE has informed me that it has detailed operational guidelines in place for the assessment of medical card applications. The purpose of these is to ensure that every person entitled to a medical card or GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement and that there is a consistency of approach to means-testing nationally. I am informed that the guidelines include provisions dealing with medical card review dates which state that "the guiding principle for setting a review date should be to set a date in each case at which an income/dependency change or other change could reasonably be expected to occur which would affect eligibility".</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">I consider it appropriate that the Executive carry out periodic reviews of medical card holders in order to establish whether they continue to be eligible for services under the Scheme. The HSE indicates that such reviews are conducted in a manner that takes due account of the personal circumstances of the card holder and that arrangements are in place to limit the need for frequent reviews where a review would normally result in the renewal of the medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">Under the Health Act 1970, the HSE may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.  The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.  I have no plans to extend medical card cover to persons with other long-term conditions.</p>

An extra €30 million has been provided in 2007 for this purpose.  The HSE has recently finalised National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme. Under the guidelines, the assessment of means will now be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.</p>

            <p eId="para_1809">The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied.  These regulations were signed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children on 14 January 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">Class 1</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.  In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Class 2</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.

            <p eId="para_1814">These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person.  Charges are calculated using a standardised process, the details of which are available in the HSE's  Long Stay National Guidelines.  A number of exemptions exist under section 4(b) (3) of the Health Amendment Act 2005 and section 4(b) (4) allows for the reduction or waivering of a charge if it is necessary to so do to avoid undue financial hardship. The Guidelines also outline a number of allowable expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">In addition the HSE National Long Stay Guidelines state that "if the person is an in-patient for five out of seven days then the charge should be made pro-rata".  Therefore if a person leaves the Long Stay Unit the charges for a short period of time such as to return home for a week-end, are reduced on a pro rata basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship".  Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person's overall financial situation in view of the person's reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</p>

            <p eId="para_1854">Costs to date in 2007 amount to approximately €30,000. It should be noted that these figures do not include the cost of officials in my Department responding to these cases.  These cases are, in the main, taken against the Department of Education and Science and allege a failure on behalf of the State to provide for an appropriate education as provided for in the Constitution.  While these cases are mainly taken by parents of children with autism, there are also a number of cases relating to ADHD and intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities.  The Deputy should note that the Department of Health and Children is not specifically named as a defendant in all of these cases but is involved due to its role in the formulation and development of policy in respect of the provision of health care and support services.  The Health Act 2004 provided for the creation of the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005.  Pursuant to the Health Act, 2004, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  This includes responsibility for all health related supports.  As such, my Department does not have a function in relation to the provision of services to individuals. In a number of the cases the Health Service Executive is also named as a co-defendant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">As the Deputy is aware there has been significant progress made over the past number of years in relation to enhancing and developing services for people with disabilities.  An integral part of the National Disability Strategy is the implementation of two major legislative measures — the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 both of which provide a framework for the planning and delivery of health and personal social services and education services for people with disabilities.  The Multi-Annual Investment Programme published by the Government in December 2004 as part of the National Disability Strategy contained details of specific commitments in relation to the provision of specific high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009.  The programme, together with the enhancement of other key support services, is a key factor in building the additional capacity required to put in place the new framework provided for in the Disability Act and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  The funding provided for in the National Disability Strategy amounts to €900 million over the period 2006 to 2009.  Overall additional funding of €41 million was provided in 2006, the bulk of which will be used to enhance the level and range of multidisciplinary support services available to adults and children with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities, autism and mental illness, with a priority on enhancing the assessment and support services for children with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">I am satisfied that the level of investment in disability services demonstrates that the Government is committed to the provision of appropriate services to enhance capacity within the health services in order to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the National Disability Strategy.  This includes continued enhancements to all services to allow children with disabilities participate in the education system.  Funding of €75m is being provided in 2007 that incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy of which €41m is allocated to the provision of  residential, respite and day services to those with an intellectual disability and autism.  Included in this €41m is €2.2m for the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from settings which are inappropriate to their needs.  €12m is being provided for residential places and additional hours of personal assistance and home supports for persons with physical and sensory disabilities.  €15m is being provided in 2007 to meet commitments relating to the enactment of Part II of the Disability Act 2005 which commences on 1 June 2007.  Of the €75m, €5m is being provided for core underfunding deficits in voluntary organisations and €2m is being provided for increases in the capitation rate for Rehabilitation Training.</p>

            <p eId="para_1858">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1862">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase One of this Programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. This Programme has been extended to more than 90 additional towns nationwide and these MANs are due for completion during 2007 and 2008. These Metropolitan Area Networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country, including areas in County Carlow and County Kilkenny where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. It is planned to address the question of availability of broadband to unserved areas via a new scheme which, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas are met. A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender is underway. Indicative maps are being prepared to help inform the tendering process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">My Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless. The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.</p>

            <p eId="para_1869">I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 to 149, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">The Standing Scientific Committee of the National Salmon Commission has advised that stocks of salmon in the Rivers Suir, Nore and Barrow are below conservation limits. For this reason, the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme (No. 2) Regulations 2006 do not identify a surplus of fish available for harvest in 2007. Commercial fishing (including snap net licences) will therefore not be issued in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">During 2007 fish stock assessment studies will be undertaken in order to forecast the position for 2008 and beyond. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute will monitor the stocks in developing a management plan for the rivers Suir, Nore and Barrow with a view to identifying the extent of the recovery, if any, arising from the cessation of the mixed stock commercial fishery and any stock rehabilitation works undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">In the future event that stocks recover in each of the rivers of the Waterford Estuary, and it is established from the results of the Genetic Stock Identification Project that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted within the rivers and estuary, it should be possible to exploit the identified surplus by all methods (drift-nets, draft-nets, snap-nets and rod) but within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive as transposed by the European Communities (National Habitats) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997).</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">While it is not the intention to issue commercial fishing licences for the Waterford District in 2007, any future issue of licences under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order will recognise 2006 as the most recent year for fishing in determining the order for the allocation of licences.  Anyone who makes an application and receives a payment under the Salmon Hardship Scheme will be required to give an undertaking not to make a future application for a commercial salmon licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_1880">Negotiations are ongoing and four of the six ACP regions have either agreed or publicly affirmed the aim to conclude the negotiations within the given timeframe.

            <p eId="para_1884">The Convention states that it will open for signature on 30 March 2007 and that States may subsequently ratify the Convention. The Convention will enter into force on the thirtieth day after the deposit of the twentieth instrument of ratification or accession by States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">At present, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has lead responsibility for equality issues for persons with disabilities, is examining the Convention before seeking Government approval for Ireland to sign the Convention. I am hopeful that Ireland will be in a position to do so at an early date. Thereafter the steps necessary to allow for ratification, and the timescale for these steps, will be primarily for the Tánaiste and his Department to consider.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1887">There are significant Kurdish minority populations in Turkey, Iraq and Iran, and a smaller population in parts of Syria.  There are 15 million people of Kurdish ethnic origin living in Turkey, mostly in the south east of the country. The Government's concerns about the human rights situation in Turkey, including the situation of people of Kurdish origin are raised on a regular basis in our contacts with the Turkish Government. Most recently, I raised our concerns about the human rights situation in Turkey at my meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Gul on the margins of the UN General Assembly last September and with Turkey's Chief European Union Negotiator, State Minister Babaçan, during his visit to Ireland on 2 November.  In recent years Turkey has made significant progress in the adoption of wide-ranging political and legal reforms. Important human rights reforms have been introduced and legislation enacted aimed at strengthening the enforcement of human rights, including the cultural rights of all citizens including those of Kurdish origin. In this context, I welcome the beginning of broadcasting in the Kurdish language.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">The security situation in the South–East of the country, which had gradually improved since 1999, has again become increasingly difficult in the last year. This follows the resumption of violence by the PKK, a Kurdish organisation that appears on the EU list of terrorist organisations. This led to violent clashes with the security forces in March 2006, which resulted in casualties including, very regrettably, civilian deaths. There are also suggestions that the group was involved in a series of bombings which took place in August 2006, where civilians, including foreign tourists were targeted. We continue to closely monitor developments in the region through our Embassy in Ankara, and in cooperation with our EU partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">In Iraq, the de facto autonomy of the Kurdish region since the mid 1990s has been confirmed and strengthened following the end of the regime of Saddam Hussein. The two main Kurdish parties are key members of the broad coalition that makes up the Iraqi Government. The President of Iraq is the Kurdish leader Jalal Talibani. The new Iraqi Constitution, adopted by popular vote in October 2005, recognises Kurds as one of the component peoples of Iraq, and provides for the exercise of a large degree of autonomy by the three Kurdish provinces, acting together as a Kurdish region. There is reason to hope that this settlement, if it can survive the serious violence threatening to destabilise Iraq, can provide a long-term solution to the issue of the rights and aspirations of Kurds within Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">The Government are not aware of any serious discrimination against Kurdish people in Iran specifically on the basis of their ethnic origin. However, the conservative regime which has come to power in Iran in recent years shows much less tolerance than its reformist predecessor for expressions of identity by Iran's many ethnic minorities, and this has led to violent incidents and arrests in a number of provincial cities, including in Kurdish areas. In addition, the overall human rights situation in Iran continues to be a matter of concern, and Ireland co-sponsored a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly last December, which expressed serious concern at the continuing violations of human rights in Iran. Among a number of recommendations, the resolution called upon the Government of Iran to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on religious grounds or against persons belonging to minorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">Regrettably, there has been a continual worsening of the human rights situation in Iran in recent years. The EU's human rights dialogue with Iran, through which we sought constructively to encourage improvements, has fallen into abeyance due to Iran's refusal to agree to further meetings. We will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Iran, including the situation of the Kurdish minority, through our Embassy in Tehran and in cooperation with our EU partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 to 158, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">In reply to PQ reference No. 31400 on 5th October last, I stated that the Health and Safety Authority had commissioned a report into the circumstances surrounding the incident referred to by the Deputy. This report was to ascertain the facts to assist in the determination of whether the Authority has a remit in relation to this matter. The Health and Safety Authority is now investigating the circumstances of the incident referred to as they relate to legislation within the Authority's remit. As this is an ongoing active investigation it would be inappropriate to make any further comment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">Although the incident took place in 2001, it was initially considered to be a traffic accident and outside the remit of the Health and Safety Authority. Following further consideration by the Authority and taking various views into account, the report referred to above was commissioned and in late 2006 the Authority commenced its investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">The Health and Safety Authority ensures that all workplace fatal accidents  are the focus of an immediate investigation. It has developed and put in place extensive procedures to ensure that such investigations are conducted in line with best practice and has developed a Memorandum of Understanding with the gardaí to ensure the optimal utilisation of the resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">There has been a notable shift to prosecution on indictment by the Authority in recent years with 45% of the prosecutions in 2005 being taken in the Circuit Court. The criminal investigations undertaken by the Authority are conducted in a detailed and thorough way and this of itself can take considerable time. Investigations are kept under review to ensure that they are completed in as reasonable a time frame as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">The Authority, through its regionally based inspection staff and its dedicated investigation unit, ensures it is in a position to respond to occupationally related fatalities, dangerous occurrences and serious incidents. The Authority is continuously reviewing its deployment of resources in order that its work priorities can be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1909">The development of a knowledge-based economy is one of the key challenges and opportunities facing Ireland. Increasing international competition requires improvements in efficiency, quality and productivity and a growing need to innovate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, launched in June 2006, was devised to address these very demanding challenges. The Strategy, which constitutes one of the principal pillars of the NDP, strives towards a vision of an Ireland in 2013 internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">Over the lifetime of the NDP the State will invest €6.1 billion in STI as detailed in the programme areas below.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1912">World Class Research STI — €3,462 million</p>

            <p eId="para_1920">The investment in human capital, physical infrastructure and commercialisation of research outlined above is complemented by investment in initiatives set out in the NDP allocations for Higher Education and the IDA. Taking account of these amounts, the global NDP investment in STI amounts to €8.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">The imperative to invest in R&amp;D and its applications is matched by the need to be innovative in other areas of the economy.  Services, including financial services, constitute one such sector.  To that end, Forfás has developed a document, Services Innovation in Ireland — Options for Innovation Policy, which draws on a number of case studies to identify the main drivers of innovation in Ireland and which makes the case for Ireland to develop specific policies for services innovation.  That document has been circulated to key stakeholders for consultation.  Feedback from this consultation will allow Forfás to develop further proposals in this sector in the context of its 2007 Work Programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1923">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Rent supplements are subject to a limit depending on household size, on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation.  Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example: where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances such as disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons; where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period; and where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.  In November 2002, when the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index first showed evidence of continued reductions in rent levels, regulations were introduced to set the maximum amount of rent in respect of which a rent supplement is payable. These limits remained in place to the end of December 2003. Further Regulations were introduced in December 2003 and July 2005 to prescribe the limits to be used up to December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">My Department recently completed a review of the rent limits in order to determine if the existing maximum rent limits required any adjustments. The review took account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation within each of its operational areas.  The review also included consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board. In addition, a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area made detailed submissions. This process is designed to ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs. I recently introduced new Regulations setting rent limits for the period 26 January 2007 to 30 June 2008. These new Regulations provided for moderate increases in certain rent limits with no change in others — no rent limit was reduced. I am arranging for details of the new rent limits to be forwarded to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1933">I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 184 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">Child benefit can be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the State. Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education, or disabled and incapable of self-support. The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and since 1 May 2004, the qualified person must satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were being imposed at that time by most of the other Member States. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">EU Regulations provide that migrant workers who are EEA nationals, i.e. EEA nationals who have been employed or self-employed since coming to this country, or  receiving Irish Jobseeker's benefit, are entitled to payment of family benefits in respect of their families who reside in another Member State. In these circumstances the family members are treated as if they are habitually resident in Ireland for the purpose of Child Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">For the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 January 2007, the number of child benefit claims that required particular examination of the habitual residence condition was 16,092.    Of these only 1,557 (less than 10%) were disallowed.  Those who are refused are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, who do not have a work permit or who have only a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">I am satisfied that the habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose, allowing access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.  I have no plans to remove the condition.</p>

            <p eId="para_1940">Child benefit is a universal payment, paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years.  It continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families.  Commitment to this policy is reflected in the significant resources invested in the scheme since 2001, increasing monthly payments to €160.00 for each of the first two children and €195.00 for the third and subsequent children from April 2007.  This represents increases of 320% and 294% respectively since 1997, compared to a 41.4% increase in the consumer price index over the same period.</p>

This is a non-statutory scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations providing a range of family counselling services aimed at enhancing stability in family life, and assisting families and their members to deal with difficult periods which they may experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">In 2006, over €9 million was provided by the Government to the Family Support Agency for the scheme and a total of 541 organisations countrywide received funding.  In Budget 2007 I increased the funds available to the Family Support Agency for the scheme of grants to over €10 million.  The availability of this funding was advertised in January and over 500 applications have been received and are currently being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">In processing applications indicators of quality of service include:</p>

            <p eId="para_2007">In January of this year I launched the review of the marriage, child and bereavement counselling scheme of grants, commissioned by the Agency and conducted by independent consultants Petrus Ltd. This review assessed the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of providing accessible and high quality counselling services to those who, without the support provided by the grants scheme, could not otherwise afford it or who would not otherwise access it, assessed the scheme in terms of value for money and made recommendations for measures which would facilitate the ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of the scheme. The review provides overwhelming proof of the success of the counselling grants scheme.  A sub group of the board of the Agency are currently examining the report with a view to further developing the scheme in line with the recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2009">The Community Employment (CE) scheme is a programme administered by FÁS which is designed to assist long-term unemployed and others who are distant from the labour force by offering them part-time and temporary work positions in jobs based within local communities. Following the placement, participants are actively encouraged to capitalise on the skills and experience that they have obtained through the scheme by seeking more permanent part-time and full-time opportunities within the mainstream workforce.  Participants on the CE scheme are provided with an average of 39 hours of paid employment per fortnight for a one-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">Earnings from this work are liable to PRSI contributions at class A. Participants with reckonable weekly pay of €339 or less are insured at PRSI sub-class A8 and are exempt from paying a PRSI contribution, while participants with earnings exceeding that amount are insured under PRSI sub-class A9 which has an employee social insurance liability of 4 per cent of earnings after the first €127.

            <p eId="para_2011">The requirement to pay PRSI Class A contributions was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, to enhance the working status of CE participants and to afford them the same level of social protection as fully insured workers. This extension effectively placed these workers on an equal footing with PRSI Class A workers — both in terms of social insurance liabilities and benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_2013">Compulsory social insurance for self-employed workers was introduced in 1988. In the legislation providing for Class S contributions, a general exclusion for people whose total income is below a certain threshold was put in place, similar to that which already existed for employees.  The level at which a self-employed person becomes eligible for Class S contributions has remained unchanged over the 19 years since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">Currently any self-employed person aged between 16 and 66 years and with a total income of €3,174 or more per annum is liable for social insurance contributions at 3 per cent of reckonable income.  Contributions made at PRSI Class S provide cover for a range of income replacement benefits — including the state pension (contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">The state pension (contributory) is a social insurance payment made to both employed and self-employed persons aged 66 or over, who started paying social insurance contributions before reaching age 56. The standard qualifying conditions for contributory pensions require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time that they enter insurance until they reach pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">Those who are no longer liable for PRSI Class S contributions, for example if reckonable income falls below the €3,174 per annum threshold, may opt to protect pension entitlements by applying to become a voluntary contributor.  In order to be admitted to the voluntary contributions scheme, a person must have a minimum of 260 weeks of PRSI paid in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of being insurable.   The requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the scheme ensures that the requisite number of paid contributions required is in place to establish a contributory pension entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">There is no legal basis on which to accept contributions — retrospective or otherwise — apart from where a worker has a liability that is set out in legislation. The Government is committed as part of the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement to publish a Green Paper on all aspects of the pensions system, including social welfare pensions. It is expected that the Green Paper will be finalised around the end of March, 2007, and published shortly thereafter. A consultation process will then take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2032">In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on his/her social insurance record. I am anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for a contributory pension and, in this regard, the range of reduced payments has been expanded over the years so that more people can receive a payment.  Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions. Arrangements are also in place for the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records, contributions from other EU member States or countries with which Ireland has a reciprocal agreement, and a number of special pensions such as the pre-53 are also available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">Overall, the pensions which people receive under the social welfare system represent good value for the level of contributions which many people pay and I think it is only reasonable to expect that those qualifying achieve a minimum level of contributions on their social insurance record. Such provisions are a common feature of pension systems in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">The qualifying conditions for pensions are designed to uphold the contributory principles underlying eligibility for pensions which require that a person has made a sustained and ongoing commitment to social insurance. Awarding pensions on a pro-rata basis for any contributions made would not, I consider, be in keeping with these principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">Issues in relation to contribution conditions are being examined in the context of the preparation of the Green Paper on pensions, which I expect will be finalized by the end of the month.</p>

            <p eId="para_2037">Currently Ireland has bilateral social security agreements with seven countries: Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland entered into a bilateral understanding with Canada on 1 October 1994.   The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreements apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">Bilateral agreements provide for periods of insurance and, where appropriate, periods treated as equivalent to periods of insurance in Ireland and the relevant country, to be combined for the purposes of calculating any pension entitlements. They also provide that workers posted on a temporary basis may continue to be covered under the social insurance system of the country in which they were previously insured.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">Social welfare entitlements falling for examination under EU or bilateral agreements take a longer time to process than domestic claims due to the need to obtain and exchange information with the other countries involved. Additionally, the logistics involved in transferring information between institutions in different countries can lead to delays outside the control of my Department. Reviews of the implementation of EU and bilateral arrangements are carried out from time to time by officials of the Department to expedite transfers of information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2040">There is, at present, a build-up of claims for processing under EU and bilateral arrangements arising from the substantial increase in claims from EU nationals in recent years.  In the majority of cases the people involved are in receipt of a pension from another Member State or country with which the Department has a bilateral agreement.  My Department is endeavouring to process these claims as quickly as possible.  Overtime and deployment of staff from other areas is currently being used to assist with the work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">Delays in processing applications do not ultimately result in any losses to pensioners in that those who qualify for payment have their claims backdated fully in accordance with the normal regulations for backdating pension claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_2044">I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme from 15 to 12 months in the 2005 Budget.  At that time, I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from €254 to €400.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">Following an undertaking to the Dáil and the Social Affairs Committee, I further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to 9 months.  This condition applies to persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individuals employment prospects.  This new condition also came into effect from 1 September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">In the 2006 Budget, I announced that time spent in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the Health Services Executive or the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can count towards the qualifying period for back to education allowance in circumstances where the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course of study.  This provision came into effect from 1 September 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">In the most recent Budget, I announced that people who are awarded Statutory Redundancy may access the BTEA scheme immediately provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  I also reduced the qualifying period for illness benefit recipients from three to two years.  These further improvements to the BTEA scheme will come into effect from the beginning of the new academic year i.e. 1 September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that my Department's back to education allowance scheme continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.</p>

            <p eId="para_2055">One of the key objectives of the 2007 social welfare package was to protect and enhance the value of all weekly rates of payment, including the rate of widows or widowers pensions, in relative terms by giving increases which are well in excess of projected inflation (4.1%) for this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">In Budget 2007, contributory State pensions, including the widow/er's contributory pension (aged 66 and over) were increased by €16 per week, or 8.3% with proportionate increases being given to those on reduced rates of payment. Last September, the State pension non-contributory replaced the widow/er's non-contributory pension (and other schemes) for widows and widowers aged 66 an over. The new pension was increased by €18 per week or 9.9%. This means that the Government has now achieved its commitment to bring the rate of the basic State pension to €200 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">Younger widows and widowers benefited from the €20 per week increase, or 12.1%, in the weekly rates of payment for persons of working age, including the widow/er's non-contributory pension (aged under 66) and the one parent family payment. This increase brings the lowest rates of payment to €185.80 per week, thereby ensuring that the Government commitment on the lowest rates of payment is fully achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">Widows and widowers with children also benefited from the increase in the child dependant allowances to €22 per week and the €10 per month increase in Child Benefit rates.  In addition, the fuel allowance was increased by €4 per week to €18. This means that this allowance has doubled over the last two Budgets.  Last September, I announced that the number of free units of electricity and gas paid under the Household Benefits Scheme would increase by 600 units a year to 2,400 units with effect from January last.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">Finally, I increased the widowed parent grant by €1,300, to €4,000, with effect from Budget Day in recognition of the particular difficulties faced by widows and widowers on the death of a spouse.  By any standards, the levels of increases and other improvements announced in the Budget were exceptional and a further demonstration of this Government's ongoing commitment to the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_2061">Carer's Allowance is a social assistance payment paid to people who are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care.    The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and as a general rule only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware that this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.   For that reason I was very pleased to introduce fundamental reforms in this area in Budget 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">In the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007, which I published recently, I provided for new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, who are also providing full time care and attention, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance.  A person currently in receipt of a carer's allowance, who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment, will be able to transfer to that payment and receive up to a half rate carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">These new arrangements will apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.  Recipients of jobseeker's allowance or benefit will not be eligible for the new arrangements, given the nature of these payments.   This is in line with the arrangements which currently apply to receipt of the respite care  grant. It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at a cost of some €57 million in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">"Towards 2016" commits the Government to continuing to review the scope for further development of the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.

            <p eId="para_2211">I should advise the Deputy in the first instance of my understanding that sea-going vessels are exempt from the provisions of EU Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 and Statutory Instrument 131 of 2003, European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">In the matter of the awarding of contracts by my Department for subsidised island ferry services in general, the principles of openness, transparency and fairness are rigorously adhered to.  In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the Oileán Cléire cargo and passenger service, a public tendering process was initiated by my officials in August 2006, the outcome of which has been the decision to award a contract to a company based on the island, Tithe Saoire Chléire Teo, to provide the subsidised ferry service for the five year period from March 2007 to February 2012.  It is a condition of the contract that the successful tenderer will purchase the existing State-owned vessel, Naomh Ciarán II, at the independently valued price of €135,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">While I have no function in the matter, I understand that three of the four crew members employed under the former contract were offered employment with the new company.  I should point out also that the sum of €190,691 was paid in redundancy settlements to crew members in 2001 when the decision was taken by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to discontinue direct State management of the service and to lease the vessel instead to a newly formed, privately owned company, Naomh Ciarán II Oileán Cléire Teo.  The contract governing that arrangement expired on 28 February 2007.</p>

It is expected that recommendations on the location or locations of the new programme will be made to my Department in March 2007. The call for proposals provides that the graduate entry programme will be supported by a combination of student fees, state funding and other income and proposers were asked to address these issues in their submissions. The call for proposals also required bidders to outline specific arrangements regarding access for under-represented groups. The extent of the subsidy and the level of fees for the graduate entry programme cannot therefore be addressed until the proposals have been fully examined and the recommendations received by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2270">Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests.  For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools.  The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">Reviews of catchment areas generally only take place when a post-primary school closes or when a new post primary school is being established.  In the circumstances, it is not intended to carry out a review of county Wexford catchment boundaries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2277">The numbers of court actions initiated against the Minister for Education and Science regarding the provision of school places for students with special needs or the provision of resources relating to students with special needs in the years referred to by the Deputy are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2278">2003: 17 cases (8 Judicial Review, 9 Plenary).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2279">2004: 17 cases (7 Judicial Review, 10 Plenary).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2280">2005:  9 (4 Judicial Review, 5 Plenary).</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">Only three actions have gone as far as hearing in the courts since 2003.  In two of these the Court ruled in favour of the State while judgment is awaited in the third.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">Contributions made to the legal costs of Plaintiffs for each of the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 were approximately €3.8 million, €5.2 million and €1.2 million respectively.  Ex gratia payments made in the settlement of these cases in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively were approximately €660,000, €420,000 and €100,000.  The above payments do not refer exactly to those cases settled in that period, as payments are often made some time after settlement.  Neither do the payments include the legal costs of the State itself in defending the proceedings, as these are borne by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">Of the cases initiated in 2003, 14 related to primary or special school education, three to post primary; of those initiated in 2004, 15 related to primary or special school education and two to post primary; and of those initiated in 2005, eight related to primary and one to post primary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">Improving services for children with special needs has been and continues to be a major priority for this Government.  Major progress has been made in recent years.  Indeed, there are now 15,000 adults in our schools working solely with children with special needs — compared to just a fraction of this a few years back.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">As well as providing for huge increases in staff, we have also improved the procedures for accessing extra support.  A guaranteed allocation of resource teaching hours has been given to all primary schools, replacing the need for an individual assessment for every single child.  And we have put a team of 80 local Special Educational Needs Organisers on the ground to work with parents and teachers and help them to get the appropriate support for their children.  Further improvements in services are on the way, with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  Over €820 million is being provided for special education in 2007- €180 million, or nearly 30%, more than what was provided in the 2006 Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">It is, I think, fair to say that the parents of children with special needs, who bring an action are, generally, seeking a particular form of provision for their child.  The State makes every effort to reach an agreement with the parents while having regard to their genuine concerns and wishes, Government policy, the best interests of the child and the expert advice available to it.  In the last six years, only three cases have gone as far as being ruled upon by the Courts, all of which the State successfully defended.  Judgment of the High Court is currently awaited in a fourth case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2287">Obviously I would prefer to use all the resources available to me for the provision of educational services.  However, once a case has been brought, the State is entitled to defend the case, particularly when it has a different view of how the best interests of the child can be met within its constitutional and statutory obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">The numbers of these cases taken against the State is showing a downward trend and I believe that the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will further assist in the reduction in litigation by providing through its Special Educational Needs Organisers, a more focused and local response to individual needs.  In addition, with the phased implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, parents who believe their child's needs are not being met will have a process of mediation and appeals open to them.  These are likely to prove more appropriate, and less costly, fora for the resolution of these issues in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">Many of the cases taken against my Department over the years have related to provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders.  The Government has attached a major priority to improving services for such children.  There are currently: 181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstreams schools; 16 preschool classes; 5 special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome; and 14 stand alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis.  Two of these facilities have yet to be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">I wish to assure the Deputy that I am determined to improve services for children with special needs even further and that this will continue to be a priority for me.</p>

Member State for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.

            <p eId="para_2295">The information is not readily available in the format sought by the Deputy and would take an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.  However I have asked my officials to provide the Deputy with information in relation to the extra posts recently allocated to schools in the Dublin area and this will be forwarded directly to her.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">I recently announced the schools which are to benefit from the 200 extra language support posts provided for in the 2007 Estimates.  The additional 200 teachers are part of the Government's commitment in Towards 2016 to provide an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 and to reform the limit of two teachers per school.  It is intended that a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">These extra 200 posts, which are allocated on a temporary/fixed term basis, will bring the total number of language support teachers in our schools to 1,450.  These new resources are intended for schools with large numbers of pupils who do not have English as a first language.  Under the revised arrangements, depending on the number of eligible pupils enrolled, schools may now have up to six language support teachers.  Under current arrangements, the additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.  However, it is accepted that children have different levels of language and different levels of aptitude for language learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to primary schools, assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT).  The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way.  The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.</p>

The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places which allow the returning officer to provide at each place at least one polling station that is accessible to wheelchair users.  The Act also requires that the returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users.

            <p eId="para_2314">The study of key Irish battlefields is a new research project being undertaken by the National Monuments Service of my Department which will ultimately assist in identifying the appropriate statutory protection for relevant battlefield sites under the national monuments legislative code.  The National Monuments Service will be assisted by a panel of recognised external experts in the fields of military history, archaeology and mapping.  I have invited nominees to the panel who will provide the best expertise available and who are academically and geographically representative of various national and educational institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">Given the historic resonance and relevance of this area of research in an all-island context I have invited a nominee to the panel from the Directorate of Built Heritage in the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland.   I understand that the Environment and Heritage Service is currently inputting data on battlefields into its Sites and Monuments Record and in this regard there are synergies with the battlefields research project being undertaken by my Department.  It is intended to seek opportunities to maximise those synergies in the course of the battlefields research project.  In addition, the inaugural meeting of the panel of experts to be held next month will be addressed by experts from England and Scotland on their experiences in the area of battlefield research and the compilation of relevant battlefield registers and inventories in those countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2321">In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">Authorities were required to publish the final Register for 2007/8 by 1 February last. In working to compile the Register, authorities undertook and completed the most extensive registration campaign in decades. Figures received by my Department indicate that, in this work, some 555,000 names were removed from last year's register and 523,000 names were added. Overall, the Register for 2007/2008 contains over 32,000 fewer names than last year. In relation to those eligible to vote at Dáil elections, the new Register contains some 62,000 fewer names than last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">Since the publication of the Draft Register in November, local authorities continued to make corrections with the result that the final register contains about 93,000 more names than at draft stage, or 86,000 more in the case of Dáil elections. On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that there has been a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  The final Register for 2007/2008 is now available for checking and individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the register up until 15 days before the next polling day.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">On the specific case referred to in the Question, I understand that Mayo County Council is making arrangements to contact the person concerned with a view to inclusion on the supplement.</p>

Ireland has special responsibility for the conservation of machair as, within the EU, this habitat only occurs in Ireland and Scotland.   My Department's determination of this matter was based on experience gained in 2004, when the race was permitted but resulted in significant damage to the machair.</p>

Conditions applying to this exemption limit the number of persons with such a disability or illness living in a house to a maximum of 6, and the number of resident carers to a maximum of 2.  Regulations governing the qualifications of the persons providing such care would be a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
