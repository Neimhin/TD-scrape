        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. O'Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I welcome the Bill as an innovative measure following on from the Good Friday Agreement. It is part of the implementation of the recommendations set out in the progressive Patten report which lays the foundation for a new form of policing, particularly in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">For many reasons it makes much sense to have close co-operation and, as suggested in the Bill, some measure of integration between the Garda on the southern part of the island and the new PSNI. Many problems facing the island are not confined to the South or the North. These include serious drug crimes, crime generally, the threat posed by subversives, road traffic offences and human trafficking. Many of those seeking asylum in this jurisdiction travelled through Northern Ireland. Other problems include child pornography and the smuggling of goods such as cigarettes and diesel. There is a significant role for cross-Border co-operation between the two police forces in tackling these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">For those of us who aspire to the realisation at some stage of a united Ireland by peaceful and democratic means – an aspiration I hold dear – the Bill can be viewed as the first step towards the development of an eventual all-Ireland Garda or police force. It is my aspiration that there should at some time be one force covering the entire island. It will not happen in the next few years and may not during my political lifetime. However, I hope it will be realised in my natural lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The Bill provides for two areas of interaction between both police forces. In the first it provides that police officers in the PSNI at or above the rank of inspector will be entitled to work in the South. This could be a permanent position or it could be done by way of secondment where the persons concerned would work in this jurisdiction for a period not greater than three years. A similar provision will allow members of the Garda Síochána to work in Northern Ireland. The Garda Síochána is an unarmed police force. Will members of the force working in the North have the same right to hold firearms as their colleagues in the PSNI?</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I welcome the ongoing interaction and co-operation between the various representative bodies of both forces. For example, the GRA and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and their corresponding organisations and bodies in the Six Counties already work closely on a number of issues. The holding of an all-Ireland conference last year at the Garda training headquarters, Templemore, was a welcome and encouraging development. Greater levels of co-operation between both police forces is also most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The findings of the Stevens inquiry were startling and worrying. While they were not new to the Nationalist community in the North, they confirmed their worst fears with regard to what had happened over the past couple of decades in Northern Ireland. However, while I do not make light of the findings of the inquiry, we must move ahead while reflecting on the mistakes of the past. If we keep looking over our shoulder as we progress with North-South relations, we will surely trip up over the many challenges facing both communities. This legislation is a small step towards moving forward together in various areas. It is also good to see co-operation in areas other than security such as agriculture, fisheries – this is a small island – and, possibly, health where we can work closely with our counterparts in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">While the legislation constitutes a new recognition of the proposals in the Patten report – the framework has been examined by intergovernmental agencies – we must also consider it in light of what is already taking place on the international front. There is already close co-operation between our police force and Interpol, Europol, the FBI and the CIA on major international issues such as drug trafficking and terrorism. These agencies also co-operate to deal with one of the great tragedies to have struck Europe and which has certainly impacted on Ireland in recent years, namely, the unsavoury human trafficking of unfortunate people from eastern Europe, Russia and north Africa. These individuals are sometimes brought here by drug trafficking terrorists to whom they may have paid large sums of money and who take advantage of their plight and, in many instances, do not care where or how they end up. There have been terrible tragedies at ports in Ireland and Britain. Co-operation between North and South could only prove beneficial in terms of addressing this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The greatest treaty to be signed in my lifetime and probably since the foundation of the State is the Good Friday Agreement. The Bill reflects favourably on the progress achieved in respect of the Agreement. The recent postponement of the elections in Northern Ireland was unsatisfactory and I would have preferred if they had proceeded. Only time will tell if the decision by Prime Minister Blair was wise or unfortunate, particularly in view of the fact that the marching season in the North is approaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The Bill, which, I understand, is receiving cross-party support, gives a clear indication of where we are headed. It is a positive step which I welcome with open arms. In the future, similar items of legislation should be implemented in order to augment the foundation being laid by the Bill. It could be argued that the simple interaction between the police force in the North and the Garda for which the Bill makes way is a humble beginning, but it is a significant and important step. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Cabinet must be encouraged and congratulated on their efforts in this regard. I welcome the Bill and I wish it a speedy passage through the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation because it allows me to address the issues pertaining to Northern Ireland and the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The Bill derives from the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report. If we are serious about addressing the issue of Northern Ireland, we must refer to the recent postponement of the elections. I was disappointed that the British Government postponed the elections because it is dangerous to signal that if one is dissatisfied with the possible outcome of an election, one can postpone it. That is why I believe the elections were postponed. All pro-Agreement parties have supported the peace process, but, while there have been – and will continue to be – difficulties, they must put their shoulders to the wheel to ensure that the process moves on. I accept that there will obviously be one-upmanship and gamesmanship in the lead-in to elections. Sinn Féin will also have to play its part to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement moves forward cohesively.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">As election time approaches, political parties tend to look at political issues rather than at the broader picture of the peace process and what we are trying to achieve. Sinn Féin and others in Northern Ireland will have to encourage their members to sit on the PSNI board and to be recruited into the police service. It is important that this message should be communicated to all communities in Northern Ireland. It does not bode well for community policing and the ordinary everyday problems of drug abuse, crime prevention and if there are large political parties in Northern Ireland which are still not willing to give their loyalty to a police service. We must address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">There is a need for a real statement to be issued that people on all sides of the community in Northern Ireland will forever put down their arms and refrain from using them to inflict punishment beatings or internal paramilitary disciplinary procedures. Punishment beatings are barbaric and all parties should support the police service – the establishment came about as a result of the Patten report – and should encourage their members to give their loyalty to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">There are suspicions in the Nationalist community about collusion between the RUC and paramilitaries in carrying out murders and other atrocities in the North over many years. Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the Stevens inquiry and what will follow from that. While we must get to the bottom of these issues, if we continually look backwards and try to carve tomorrow from a tombstone, we will never achieve a scenario in which everyone in the North can feel comfortable with their police service. I urge the British Government and all concerned to ensure that any inquiry that is deemed necessary is carried out in such a way that it can find the truth, expose any wrongdoing and move forward to allow everybody to support fully the police service.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The peace process is about normalising society in Northern Ireland by ensuring that politics there are democratic and accountable. However, it is also about cross-Border co-operation – a matter that is important for the South as well. We must use our resources for the advantage of everybody on the island. Cross-Border co-operation should be encouraged to an even greater extent in the areas of tourism, agriculture, the environment and anti-pollution measures. People are now travelling from the South to the North to undergo medical procedures under the treatment purchase scheme. These are positive developments which will ensure the development of co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Ultimately, that process will break down barriers and the perceptions people in the North have about the South and <i>vice versa.</i> Very few people from the Republic have travelled to or taken holidays in Northern Ireland, even since the cessation of violence and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. We should encourage them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">The Garda Síochána (Police Co-operation) Bill is a start on the road to what we consider to be normal co-operation between police forces. International co-operation on a major scale is required to address the problems of drug smuggling, paedophilia and human trafficking. There is evidence that there has been a major increase in the trafficking of people, particularly of young girls from eastern Europe into western Europe for prostitution. This is of major concern and requires police co-operation across the EU and outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">This Bill gives a legal basis and framework to more enhanced and structured co-operation between the two police services by providing that personnel from one police service may move to and work in a police service, in accordance with article 1 of the intergovernmental agreement. It is an important and positive step that people from another jurisdiction can work in our police service and <i>vice versa.</i>There is great loyalty to the Garda Síochána in the Republic. It has served the State exceptionally well since its foundation. Despite our troubled history, we have had an unarmed police force since the State's inception. This clearly demonstrates that people from the two traditions within Civil War politics have had a great loyalty to the Garda Síochána. If there is co-operation between North and South, it should encourage people in other parts of the island to look at the PSNI with the same loyalty and affection, provided that the political parties in the North support recruitment to it and encourage loyalty to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">That notwithstanding, trust must also come from the other side. There have been many allegations, some of which have been proved to be facts by the Stevens inquiry, of problems associated with collusion with paramilitaries in carrying out executions in the Nationalist community. While great wrongs were perpetrated on all sides, we must learn from them and move forward to ensure that both communities have that loyalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I welcome what the Bill sets out to achieve, but it will only achieve it if there is goodwill on all sides. We are trying to ensure that we have a police service which is effective, efficient, can draw on resources from and address problems on both sides of the Border in close co-operation for the betterment of the people on this island. It may also assist in addressing many other issues regarding human and drug trafficking and many other illegal activities carried out on an international and cross-Border basis, particularly the smuggling carried out by paramilitaries to avoid excise duties. I wish the Bill a speedy passage and I know it has broad support in the House, which I hope will be reflected in broad support for the Garda Síochána in the Republic but, more importantly, for the new Police Service of Northern Ireland in the North.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_20">It was a pleasure to hear Deputy O'Donovan say he looks forward to the day when Ireland had one united police force serving the entire country. I was two or three years old when that concept was first but forward by former Deputy Garret FitzGerald. Sadly, he was ahead of his time, but he was not helped by those on the other side of the House who did not encourage it. It is great that people look forward to it and I too look forward to it.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_24">His vision was the other way around.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The Bill before us is one that must and can be welcomed. It has long been an aspiration of my party that this would come about on this happy and peaceful island. I will put some thoughts to the Minister which have been put to me by my constituents and which I ask him to consider and clarify before the Bill becomes law.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I am sure I speak for all Deputies when I congratulate the Garda Síochána on the magnificent job it has done since the foundation of the State. At this time of change I pay tribute to the gardaí and their families who have paid the ultimate price in the course of their duties. I hope their service will never be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Policing is never an easy job. To keep a straight line in times of tension and trouble is a job only highly-trained officers can do and they do an extremely good job under often adverse conditions. In recent decades, policing on the island as a whole has cost many officers their lives. Taking of life is wrong and is a waste and we must do all we can to avoid loss of life. If this Bill and the co-operation between the police forces can lead to less crime and fewer lives lost, it must be welcomed and pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">In a perfect world – which I am afraid this is not – there would be no problems on this island and no need for two police bodies or for this legislation. However, there are two services with two very different traditions so it will be difficult to get co-operation going and staff moving between the forces. This Bill is the beginning of that and sets out a mechanism to bring it forward. Both services have had to deal with war and violence over the past 40 years and, while not trying to detract from incidents such as the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings, the RUC adopted different methods to methods used by the Garda Síochána to deal with certain situations. Some of its methods have been disturbing. Even I have been disturbed by some of the methods. While not wishing to judge, the RUC, which has been replaced by the PSNI, has many questions to answer regarding its past, management structure and agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">There must be guarantees, as we move into this new era, that the past is not forgotten about but followed up and sorted out. All the accusations must be checked out. This is about trust and we must ensure that is secured. Will the Minister give that guarantee before we move on? I refer specifically to the RUC Special Branch, which is not responsible to anyone in Northern Ireland and the huge number of allegations which have been left hanging and will take more than a name-change to remove. People seek answers on why loved ones were murdered at the hands of paramilitaries, who had top class police intelligence, if not co-operation. We must guarantee people that the investigations will continue because they deserve answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">A police service can only serve if it has the trust and support of the people it wishes to serve. While not trying to open old wounds or throw a spanner in the works, if anyone is still serving and is guilty of association, aiding or hiding murder squads, we will have to think long and hard about how we move forward. It is up to us to guarantee that all the bad apples on both police forces are removed at this time of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">While it is good to see the Good Friday Agreement still alive and well, it is worth remembering that the people of this island voted for it as a package, of which this Bill is a part. However, the overall package is stuck, although hopefully not for long. The real idea behind this Agreement was to have a devolved government in Northern Ireland, which we do not have now. While this devolved government does not exist, are we really pushing the process forward by allowing co-operation to take place in its absence? Was the timing of such a move only considered when we believed the government for the people of Northern Ireland would exist? That is not the case, therefore, while I welcome the Bill, I wonder whether we are helping or hindering the process with it. What does the Minister think of that analysis, because people are asking me to reassure them?</p>
          <p eId="para_32">We would all like to do something to progress this Agreement but, as we have seen before, timing is everything. It is all about timing, guarantees and trust and bringing people with us as we move forward. The establishment of the PSNI has seen the arrival of policing boards in Northern Ireland. Perhaps, before we rush into anything in the Republic, we should look at police reform. My colleague, Deputy Deasy and others have advocated this on numerous occasions. I am not saying there is anything wrong, but reform would improve the police. Is it time we had the right to see our local police on a local board? Is it time we see special police constables, as in the UK, doing routine police work? The possibility of a reserve force was mooted last week and this is along the same lines. However, when we asked about this in the context of proposed legislation, not a word was said. It was only talk thrown out there. Now is the time to go forward – this Bill is just one step. We should start talking about reform and use the example of the PSNI. It is also time the Garda Síochána was given the money that is required to police our streets properly. Good housekeeping staff are always needed at home. We have to get our act together while we move forward with co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We have much to gain from police co-operation, not only on this island but in Europe as a whole. Criminals have no respect for borders and different countries have learned different things about policing. The sharing of information and staff can only be good, but it must be done in an open and transparent manner. Policing is what the State exists on and we must take care to ensure we end up with the best police service. There are many areas in which we can gain into the future and these should be developed and worked on. With co-operation between staff on both sides, it is to be hoped that the possibility of criminals skipping across the Border and disappearing will be eliminated. All around the country, estates are divided from one another by two walls with a little gap in the middle. The lads that are causing trouble run through the gap and when gardaí arrive in cars, they cannot go through. It is a simple way of putting it, but that is what is happening on a larger scale. I hope it can be done away with.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">We have to tackle the issue of penalty points. I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, a committee of which has recently been discussing the issue of penalty points. Senator Brian Hayes is a member of the committee. For eight months the members have been discussing how penalty points can be implemented on both sides of the Border. Everybody seems to think it is complicated – Northern Ireland is already trying to work a system with the UK. They are getting nowhere. Why can we not impound a person's car, charge him or her a hefty fine and worry about the penalty points afterwards? If the fine was enough – if it was £1,000 – people would not break the law. A person could be told that his or her car would be kept until the fine was paid. Could we consider things like this? Maybe it is a bit too simple or there is some reason we cannot do this, but now is the time to discuss these things.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Deputy Kelleher and others mentioned the issue of drugs. This is causing concern to many families – it is one of the greatest worries for parents. Drink is a concern, but drugs are even worse. It is to be hoped that with co-operation and sharing of information, something can be done about this. Many of the policing staff here and in the North will have different ideas which they can share with each other. It is only by working with each other on an exchange programme such as this that the information will get across. I hope there will be developments in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">This Bill and the co-operation that will result should certainly help with reform. A mix of people will always result in new ideas and change. I look forward to this and I hope it works out that way. It sets a good example for members of the Garda Síochána to visit the North and <i>vice versa.</i> It shows how it can be done. It is our duty to try to work on Bills that lead by example and this is a good chance to do that. It is to be hoped there will be plenty of opportunities into the future. We are short of gardaí in this country, so perhaps we can borrow some from up North. I see they can stay for three years, so while we are training people down here perhaps we could do a deal for a couple of hundred members of the PSNI, if not more, to come and work here. Working on this might solve some of our problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Organised crime is a serious issue and it will take serious co-operation to deal with it. This Bill is another step in that direction. It is common sense. I ask that we get the Bill passed as quickly as we can, as long as we are aware of people's concerns. I do not want to rehash them as I mentioned them earlier, but they have to be addressed and not just put to one side. Hopefully this will be an example to many civilians in their own fields of work and they will look at other ways of co-operating and sharing their thoughts. This Bill is only one piece in a big jigsaw that must be completed if we are to have lasting peace on this island. I ask that all of us do what we can to add more pieces of the jigsaw as we go along. I recommend this Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_38">I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of speaking in this truly historic debate. It is marvellous to see legislation such as this going through the House. Many of us are tending towards a more pessimistic mindset at the moment because of the logjam in the peace process, but this is a further illustration of how the peace process is working at a practical level, perhaps the most practical of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I thank Deputy English for his fine contribution. He was right and brave to mention Garret FitzGerald in the context of this process. He has not been acknowledged enough. Due to the intensity of the most recent stage of the process, it is often forgotten that he played an amazing role in reaching the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which began the whole process of enhanced co-operation at police force and political levels. We are now benefiting from this and we have benefited throughout this period of the peace process. In fact, it was mainly Dr. FitzGerald, although Mr. Haughey also played a role at an earlier period in the 1980s, who initiated this process in conjunction with John Hume. It has led to enhanced co-operation and to a unique understanding among British and Irish parliamentarians, judges and police. It is an amazing thing to have witnessed over the last few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Deputy English shares with Deputy Costello the distinction of being a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and they have seen for the first time the strong and unique relationship that now exists between London and Dublin and between the parliamentarians from both Parliaments. The absence of hostility is important and the absence of violence, in real terms, is of great benefit to the process. Pessimistic people see the glass as half-empty rather than half-full – I believe the glass is half-full. There is a lot left to be resolved, but I do not believe the difficulties are insuperable. There are problems on both sides of this process. Here in the House we are passing legislation that will, for the first time, move us more towards the possibility of an all-Ireland police force and a common policing regime across the island. Deputy English also mentioned this. That is what I aspire to, and I know that many within Fine Gael, including Deputy Deasy, are also of a national mindset – they believe in Irish unity achieved through peaceful means. This is something to which we all aspire and this is one practical step – allowing people to transfer from one police force to another, even at the highest and most senior levels of senior officer or superintendent and above. People can go back and forth and share their experiences because, as Deputy English said, in sharing different approaches everybody learns and gains.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">The different experiences of the two police forces, North and South, are remarkable. The RUC, a kind of backwash from the old RIC, was never really accepted within Northern Ireland – perhaps for a brief period in the 1950s and 1960s it may have had a modicum of respect among the Nationalist community, but as the conflict intensified into the late 1960s and early 1970s, it increasingly became a force under siege, a force that did not command the respect of the Nationalist population. Also, as we know now from the Stevens inquiry and the allegations of collusion that resulted, it was a force that was contaminated by what can only be described as the dirty and squalid war that was being conducted in the North and elsewhere, based on the conflict between Nationalists and Unionists that exists in that society and on the island. From the allegations that resulted from the Stevens inquiry, and indeed from the revelations about the alleged informer Stakeknife, we are seeing the really dirty under belly of the conflict and what has really been happening over the last few years. We are seeing for the first time, through plain evidence, what a lot of people suspected for years and perhaps knew. As a journalist many years ago, I held the view that there was an unhealthy level of collusion going on between the British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries. There were no angels on the other side either and one cannot confer any legitimacy on the kind of war that was being conducted without a mandate by the IRA.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_43">I think it was General Sir Frank Kitson who described this as a low intensity war. It was low all right and I am not sure about the intensity but it was certainly a low war of low blows on both sides. As a society and a country and, as an island, we are very lucky that it is now in the past. I covered Westminster as a journalist and I had particular experience of the Finucane case. I happened to be the only reporter at Westminster to cover the remarks of the then Minister, Mr. Hogg, in the House of Commons by which I was very shocked. I carried them in the <i>Irish News </i>and less than a week or two later, Pat Finucane was shot and one had to consider whether one's work had in some sense been a contributory factor. A British Minister most irresponsibly stated in the House of Commons that solicitors were colluding with paramilitaries and the inevitable result was the unfortunate and tragic death of Mr. Finucane. It is a reminder to us all to be very responsible in what we say in this House and in the approach we take.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">This Bill brings us back to that. People talk about institutions in the North of Ireland but let us speak plainly: the North of Ireland is a very dysfunctional democracy characterised by violence with bitter sectarian feuds and hatreds on both sides. This is not a normal democracy where the majority are allowed to rule even with the wonderful initiative of the Good Friday Agreement. The majority will never be allowed to rule in the North of Ireland for quite some time to come and that is a sign of dysfunctionality. In most normal democracies there is an election and the majority winner takes the spoils of office and rule the country.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_47">Unfortunately, that cannot happen in the North of Ireland. This Bill underlines that policing is far more important than those institutions. The first step of any civilised society if it wishes to consider itself a democracy is to set up and establish a police force. When this country gained its independence in 1922 in the most heroic manner from the then huge and vastly resourced British empire, we knew the difficulties involved in the establishment of a police force and the threats and challenges it had to face. In fairness to the Garda Síochána, it stood the test of time and many of its members were shot and killed by republicans and others at the initiation of the State. It established its reputation as an unarmed police force that was ready and willing to serve the public to whom it owed its allegiance.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Hopefully, the new police force in the North will earn the same respect and, in particular, the respect of the Sinn Féin Party so that they can advise their members and former members and members of paramilitary organisations to join the force. Hopefully in the not too distant future they will take that vital step and give a certain legitimacy to this new police force.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">We should be conscious in the Republic that the North was not without its consequences in policing terms for our society. A great deal of the drugs problem in the Republic is not caused by drugs being imported by sea or by air but rather by drugs coming over the Border from Northern Ireland. It is well known that certain paramilitary groups not only take a rent from the drugs business but also actively trade in drugs. It has been suggested to me by people involved in the police forces on both sides of the Border that loyalist paramilitaries were encouraged to trade drugs in the Republic in order to fund their activities to counter the threat posed, as they saw it, by the IRA. It was a safe and easy option for the loyalist gangs because they could dump and sell drugs in the Republic and not be seen to be dealing in drugs in their own territory. There seems to be strong evidence of this. Whether there was collusion by the British Crown forces in assisting that process is a moot point but having seen and heard what happened regarding other matters such as the Finucane case, the Stevens inquiry and the Stakeknife episode, one can only imagine what is going on under the surface in the dysfunctional society north of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">It is very important to move on. I am not one of those who believes that we need constant inquiries and investigations into what happened in the past in Northern Ireland nor indeed here in the Republic. Sometimes a line must be drawn under these things in order to move forward into the practical acts of policing and politics. In my view, it is a most negative tendency in the Irish mindset to constantly dwell on history and inquiries into what happened in the past. It is evident in our culture of tribunals and this House must take responsibility for this. As the political class we have become addicted to retrospective inquiry processes that serve no purpose, achieve nothing and do not improve the lot of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">If we are interested in reform and change we must move forward and enact the type of co-operative legislation such as this Bill. We must stop dwelling in the past. The allegations of collusion are terrible but we should question whether we really need a long-running investigation that might never arrive at the truth. We are perhaps better off drawing a line and making the institutions and the Good Friday Agreement work, instead of constantly calling for further inquiries into this, that and the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In the past month or so, it is clear there have been problems on both sides of the equation, in regard to Stakeknife and in regard to Stevens. If these controversies prove anything, I hope they act as a very strong pressure point on both the Unionists and Sinn Féin to make them move into and create new institutions and not stall the process. They are not serving their constituents, neither the Unionist nor the republican and Nationalist communities, by further delaying this process. We need more practical co-operation such as provided for in this Bill. We must work together on this island. There has been a huge cost to this State, estimated some years ago at €300 million per year in security costs, because of the problems associated with the Border and the conflict in Northern Ireland. There will be a huge savings and policing gain for the Republic if we can eliminate the spectre of sectarian and paramilitary violence on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">We can also enjoy a huge upsurge in investment. One of my criticisms of both the republican and the Unionist sides is that by stalling this process over the past few years they have done a big material disservice to their constituents because they have lost out on what has been the biggest investment boom ever seen on this island with inward investment literally washing into this country in the past five to six years. Those two groups have denied their voters north of the Border, who are Irish citizens, the right to participate in that strong investment surge and the employment and welfare benefits that flow from an improved and prosperous economy. I say to both sides that it is very important that there is no more delay and no more picking over the details.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Dublin and London have never been closer and possibly will never again be as close as they are now regarding their common approach to this problem. There are differences and the Taoiseach has strongly articulated the view that he would have preferred if the elections had proceeded. That is a significant difference but from the tone of what the Taoiseach and Ministers have said, it is not a difference that will cause rows between Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern. These two men are very united in their view. I suspect there is a special relationship between the two because they get on very well together. I am not so arrogant as to believe that if the Opposition were in charge it would be any different. They, too, would have a strong relationship with Tony Blair and the Dublin-London axis will be maintained no matter who is in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">This Bill will enable the transfer of senior officers from one force to the other and I think that will be good for Ireland. People in the North who are deeply involved in this process, republicans, Unionists, loyalists, Nationalists and SDLP members, should all remember that there is a huge impatience in the Republic and in Britain about the lack of progress in this process. Perhaps some parties are new to the practice of democracy and how it works on a practical level, but they should never forget that people are very impatient. If they suspect for a minute that a party is not prepared to go into power, is prepared to walk away from power and not confer legitimacy on the existing democratic institutions, electoral disaster is not far away. People of all parties must be ready to participate.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Deputy Morgan seems to take these comments desperately personally. I am not referring to the Deputy or his party but to the collective body politic in Northern Ireland. This is a problem and people are very impatient. I am not trying to be partitionist but the reality is that many people in the republic do not give a fig about the North of Ireland. They are utterly frustrated and impatient at what has been going on up there. We owe these people also. They have a voice and must be heard. If we are to build on the process we must move fast. The people are impatient for progress, and rightly so. They should not force their weight, but we should all gain, and we will all gain from a new Agreement which moves matters forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">I hope Sinn Féin will participate in the police force of Northern Ireland. I share its concerns about the RUC. I was one of the people who articulated very clearly in this House that I favoured the complete abolition of the RUC rather than the reformed police force we now have. I thought it would have been better to abolish the force completely and form a new one. However, compromises had to be made. We are now at a sort of half-way house, trying to decide whether this police force can be reformed. I believe it was Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin who said the police force of Northern Ireland can never be reformed, that they are irrevocably sectarian, which I do not believe. The Unionists say about Sinn Féin and the IRA that they are irredeemable gunmen and violent people who are addicted to violence. I do not believe that is the case. They have proved over several years their ability to be flexible and pragmatic and to move with this dynamic and process.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">In fairness, they are often blamed for stalling, delaying, picking over the details, getting worried and for making statements that Unionists do not want Catholics around the place. I do not accept that. Most people involved in this process are prepared to move forward. There are a few hard-headed Unionists who will never see any light coming from this country, parliament or from his particular party. However, they tend to be in the minority and will continue to be an increasing minority as the Government implements legislation such as this. While some may say there should be a quick set of negotiations and discussions to get this measure up and running quickly – that would be my preference – I understand the point made that perhaps a delay might be a good thing if it helped to settle people down and focus them on the reality. If the Dublin and London Governments are allowed to go ahead with practical legislative improvements such as this, it might send a message to the recalcitrant parties, who are not prepared to compromise, that the two Governments are giving a very strong signal that they will push ahead no matter what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Unionists should be aware that the Good Friday Agreement and the practical police co-operation included in this Bill is a great boon to them – they are being given an institution. Before this process began or the Good Friday Agreement was signed, most Nationalists and republicans did not want a devolved institution at all. They would have preferred if the two Governments were consulting, directing and administering affairs in the North without the disadvantage of a devolved institution, as some Nationalists would perceive it, which never was and never will be a sovereign parliament in that sense, without the security and tax-raising potential of a parliament. I am now more and more of the opinion that the two Governments will have to take their courage in their hands and begin to administer the region in terms of policing and so on.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_61">The Bill, as my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, indicated last evening, is premature and should not have been brought before the Dáil at this time. It is a step at an appropriate time in the future to which we could all accord a welcome. Unfortunately, that is not the situation we are in today. While Members have engaged in a sincere expression of their respective positions regarding the Bill, the greater number of them recognise the risks involved in what is proposed at this juncture and, given that so much has yet to be addressed and achieved, it was premature and the Government should not have moved with the legislation at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach replied as follows to questioning from me: "The British Government has made its position very clear that its war is over."  That is what the Taoiseach advised the House in reply to questioning from this Deputy on Wednesday of this week. I asked him then, and I ask again, when was this said and by whom? Where is the evidence to support this extravagant claim? It is very important that the Taoiseach comes forward with the formula of words the British Government used to convince him that the British war in Ireland is over. He, together with others, has made judgments in the formulation of statements by others involved in the war in and between these islands over the past number of decades that rejected a position that would have allowed progress to proceed. Yet, in this House, in the presence of the British ambassador, who was making his first visit to the House since his appointment, the Taoiseach was asserting that the British Government stated its war in Ireland was over. Many questions need to be asked of the Taoiseach and there are many answers which he must provide, not just to this Deputy who made the inquiry, but to the House and to the people, regarding this assertion.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">To my understanding, the British Government has never acknowledged that it was at war in Ireland at all. It is all the more interesting that it has now convinced the Taoiseach that it is over. The fact of all the evidence and all the evidence presented to the Irish people right across the board, international opinion and to sound objective opinion in Britain, would be that this war that had never been declared and that has now allegedly been deemed to have ended, has ended at all, because we see the outworking of it, and the outworking of the securicrats and the outworking of those within the British war machine and their allied agencies is continuing. It is continuing in another form. It is continuing in the old forms, but it is continuing. If nothing else was certain, those whose intention is to proceed with their aggression in Ireland are nakedly exposed. We have witnessed it again in the past week in their efforts in respect of a named individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">The type of wishful thinking engaged in by the Taoiseach is worrying in the context of legislation such as the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill 2003. This legislation has far-reaching implications for every citizen in the State and on this island. It amounts, in our view and in the opinion of a significant body of opinion on the island, to an endorsement by the Oireachtas of the PSNI as it stands. The legislation is being taken now and that judgment has been made. However, the so called Police Service of Northern Ireland does not have cross-community support in the North of Ireland and the legacy of the RUC has not been banished. We have not seen, nor are we facing, an immediate and new beginning to policing in the North of Ireland. We are not at that stage. This legislation, therefore, is extremely premature.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">The promised reforms of the PSNI have not been implemented. Crucially, policing and justice powers still reside at Westminster, with the British Government. There has not been a transfer of responsibility in terms of the judiciary and policing to a democratically returned Assembly in the North of Ireland. That has yet to happen, even though it is one of the commitments that arose from the protracted exchange between republican negotiators, the representatives of the British and Irish Governments and other parties. We have yet to see all the necessary reforms. Name change is utterly insufficient. Earlier speakers from disparate opinion in this Chamber have acknowledged the fact that, too often, we are looking at something of merely name-change proportions.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">Listening to some of the contributions last night, I was struck by how far removed some Deputies are from the reality of life for hundreds of thousands of Nationalist people north of the Border. It is not an issue of being miles apart, because it has nothing to do with geography. It is to do with minds apart and the refusal of some in this State even to acknowledge the pain and suffering inflicted on the Nationalist community in the North of Ireland by the so-called police force, the RUC. That is the sad reality. Deputy Conor Lenihan, worryingly, but factually, made the point that many people in this State, and I cannot quote the exact phrase he used, do not give a—</p>

          <p eId="para_72">As other Deputies have pointed out, we cannot address this legislation without considering the disgraceful decision of the British Prime Minister to cancel an Irish election that was scheduled to take place on 29 May. Those elections were another legally provided-for commitment in the internationally binding Good Friday Agreement of 1998. It is more than a tragedy that these elections have been cancelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">This must be seen against the backdrop of the recent protracted talks and the fact that progress on most, if not all, fronts in moving forward with the peace process has been made. That includes policing. Undoubtedly, progress has been made. Some of this is evident in terms of the Joint Declaration and the publication of the various documents allied to it. Progress, in respect of policing and the raft of issues that concern everybody, has been put in jeopardy by the decision to cancel the elections on 29 May. The British Prime Minister will be judged harshly, not only now but in the future, for the decision he took following a series of four suspensions of the democratically returned Assembly in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">These actions were taken allegedly against the wishes of the Irish Government. For that reason alone, proceedings on the Bill should not have continued. I again urge the Government not to proceed with the Bill as a clear signal to the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the British Government that the Oireachtas will not tolerate the unilateral cancellation of an Irish election to facilitate individual or other agendas, clearly turning democracy on its head. It is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">The suspension of the Assembly election has created a dangerous vacuum that will and can only be filled by people who are against the peace process. People from a disparate range of anti-peace process opinion will endeavour to fill the vacuum created by the decision to cancel the elections. The Taoiseach said he urged that the election should proceed and indicated that it is the wish of the Irish Government. He is a co-signatory to an internationally binding agreement. When one talks about co-chairing something, is it the case that the British representative, be it the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State or whomever, sits in one chair while the Irish representative is on a three-legged stool, with the boot of the British representative ready to flick it from under their backside? That is what has happened, time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">The term "new beginning" is frequently used with regard to policing. I am concerned that the Bill represents not a new beginning but a continuation of bad old practice and flawed thinking. Much of the truth about collusion between the RUC, British intelligence and loyalist death squads is only emerging now. Members have referred repeatedly to the Stevens report today and recently. We must recognise that the report is but an effort to manage and contain the damning revelations in a way that is least damaging to the British Government and British interests. Anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The revelations about British Government-sponsored crime in Ireland could hardly be more damning at this time. It must be remembered that throughout the period of greatest collusion, a sensitive and difficult issue that is disconcerting for Members here given what they have said, there was full co-operation between the sectarian RUC, an arm of the British war machine in Ireland, their agents and the Garda Síochána, including, sadly, an exchange of information. There was a flow of information from RUC special branch to Unionist murder gangs in the North of Ireland. Did any of that information make its way along that path? Did the people providing that information think for a moment that they may have put the lives of others in jeopardy? It is important that we recognise that is part of the story of the past 30 years and we must get rid of that legacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The British officer who ran the Force Research Unit for years, Brigadier Gordon Kerr, is still a serving member of the British armed forces and was dispatched to a senior post in the occupying forces in Iraq. He ran agents – Brian Nelson and others – within the Unionist murder gangs and with his colleagues was responsible for the web of collusion that saw British forces targeting people for assassination, including people in this State and in my own county.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">In his recently published book, loyalist Michael Stone claims that the RUC actively assisted him in carrying out his attack on the unprotected mourners at the funeral in Milltown cemetery in 1988. This is just another revelation. How much more will we learn in the coming period?</p>
          <p eId="para_80">The Stevens report has not yet been published in full and there are no independent inquiries into the murders of Pat Finucane or Rosemary Nelson, although their names have been bandied about in this Chamber and referred to time and time again. There is no public inquiry into the death of my party colleague, who stood with me in my first electoral venture in 1984 as a European parliamentary candidate in Connacht-Ulster, the late Eddie Fullerton, an elected member of Donegal County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">In this jurisdiction, tomorrow, 17 May, is the 29th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Yet we see the surviving injured and the bereaved families protesting as recently as yesterday their anguish and vexation at the fact that the Barron inquiry goes on and on without any end in sight. Their frustration is immense and they demand a full, independent, sworn inquiry as the only way to establish the full truth and the only prospect of ever receiving justice. They have lost faith in the process headed by Mr. Justice Barron. That is their view, I am only reflecting what they are reported as saying in today's newspapers. With the 29th anniversary of the atrocities that visited the citizenry of this city and my hometown of Monaghan, will our Government continue to refuse to put in place a full, independent, sworn inquiry into this terrible event?</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Under this Bill, we could have PSNI officers with questions to answer about all of the matters I have raised and others we have yet to address serving in this State. That is a vista that concerns people throughout the island and that concern will not be confined to those with strong republican beliefs or to those in the Border counties, it will be shared by people across the spectrum of opinion. That is why this is a premature step.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">This legislation should not be brought before the House at this time and Members should have taken on board that much remains to be done. The legitimate concerns and fears of the overwhelming majority of Northern Nationalist opinion should have been reflected in the thinking of Government before the decision was made to proceed with this legislation. I urge the Government at this late hour to withdraw the Bill and allow the process to proceed. Hopefully we will reach a day when we can all welcome such a measure.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_84">I wish to share time with Deputy O'Connor. I welcome this important Bill. It is heartening for all of us who aspire to a united Ireland that legislation is being dealt with in an all-island context. Thankfully, since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, various pieces of legislation has passed through the Oireachtas establishing all-Ireland bodies. Former Minister, Deputy Síle de Valera, was instrumental in establishing Waterways Ireland. That legislation was passed by this House along with that to establish the Special EU Programmes Body, Tourism Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board. Those were important measures that came about as a direct result of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its endorsement by the people of this island, North and South. I am disappointed that all parties in this House cannot subscribe to and support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Yesterday, Deputy Deasy stated that the Bill reminded him of the proposal put forward by the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garrett FitzGerald in 1982 on hot pursuit. The context is entirely different today. Deputy Ó Caoláin quite rightly referred to the totally discredited RUC. It was not a police force for the entire community in the Six Counties and it had no credibility on this island. Under no circumstances could this legislation be considered in the context of the proposals of the then Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">Thankfully, however, we now have a totally new context. Deputy Ó Caoláin rightly referred to the horrendous suffering inflicted on so many families and communities. Murder was institutionalised and took place at the behest of the British state and its agents. There was also widespread murder at the hands of paramilitary organisations masquerading under the umbrellas of republicanism or loyalism. Unfortunately, thousands of families continue to grieve because of actions initiated by the British state and by paramilitary organisations from all sides, actions that I condemn. Too many families do not even know where their loved one is buried. There will be cause for further grief for many people following the revelations of the past few weeks about the totally despicable behaviour of the British Government and its agents. We all hope that era is behind us.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Politicians on this island have one mandate, given in May 1998 – to implement the Good Friday Agreement. There are no ifs or buts about what has to be done in relation to implementing the Agreement. We had a referendum which was the first time since 1918 that the people of the 32 counties had the opportunity to vote on the one subject on the same day, with the support of the majority of the political groupings on the island. The proposals were endorsed by 86% of the people. Unfortunately, in the meantime the Agreement has not been implemented in full. We regret that the Assembly elections scheduled for 29 May are not going ahead. It is dangerous for any Government to defer elections and not let the people have their say. If we believe in and practice democracy, there comes a time every four or five years when the people choose again who they want to be represent them.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">This legislation, introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is an important measure in implementing a key aspect of the Good Friday Agreement and was provided for in the Agreement. It is another development in the area of co-operation between North and South. Those of us who suffered so much because of the artificial border around our parishes want to see the border concept eliminated from our small island. When I go to Casement Park on Sunday week, I would love to see members of the Garda Síochána policing around Belfast. Deputy Ó Caoláin would surely like to see the same when Monaghan plays there in two or three weeks time. Perhaps if Cavan and Monaghan meet in the Ulster final, it might be played in Casement Park and we could be there. We would not need any policing.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_92">Substantial progress has been made but that is not to say we have all arrived at the position at which we want to arrive. The discredited RUC has been disbanded and the Police Service of Northern Ireland established. I am disappointed that Sinn Féin did not take its place on the Northern Ireland Policing Board. The SDLP Assembly Members, Joe Byrne, Eddie McGrady and Alex Attwood, have contributed significantly to making the PSNI a service to which the community in Northern Ireland can contribute and subscribe. The SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Government at the time rejected the then Secretary of State, Peter Mandelson's legislation to implement the findings of the Patten report. By participating in the policing board and the negotiations at Weston Park the SDLP has rolled back many of the negative elements of Mr. Mandelson's legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Today there is a new coalition for change in Northern Ireland with a police ombudsman, a policing board, a new Chief Constable and an oversight commissioner working together. The special branch in the North was, if anything, more discredited than its counterparts and colleagues in the RUC. The policing board has agreed to major changes and, according to the oversight commissioner, Tom Constantine, meets the best practice requirements of any policing force in the world. Today Catholics are being recruited to the police service at levels higher than those recommended in the Patten report. Having researched the issue, if the SDLP had not agreed to participate in the board, the old RUC under Mr. Flanagan would still be masquerading as a police service in Northern Ireland today. Would that be progress? We may not have achieved everything but we have made considerable progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Every compliment is due to the Government and the SDLP which vigorously pursued implementation of the Patten recommendations and requested that the legislation brought forward by Mr. Mandelson be changed dramatically. That has happened. It is only by being members of the policing board that politicans and public representatives from different communities in the North can implement the Patten report and deliver the effective policing that the Nationalist community wants. It is entitled to this but was deprived of it from the early 1920s until 18 months ago. That is the reason I appeal again to Sinn Féin to join the policing board and the district policing partnerships because only by participating and being a vigorous and robust voice for change will the policing that we all want be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">It is heartening for those of us in this House who had the opportunity in the last years of the 20th century and the beginning of this one to enact legislation establishing bodies with a 32 county remit. As an Ulster person, I am glad that those important developments have taken place and that people from different traditions are working together in a practical way to provide jobs and new opportunities, regardless of those traditions. Those of us who represented Border constituencies received regular calls about constituents being harassed on the Border by the RUC or the British army. There were permanent vehicle checkpoints. When I went to my clinics in west Cavan, I could not take the short cuts through Fermanagh – the journey from some parts of Cavan to Blacklion is shorter through Fermanagh – because I was certain that I would be delayed. I took the longer route. That has changed dramatically since the end of August 1994. The permanent checkpoints outside towns in my area such as Ballyconnell, Swanlinbar, Redhill and Newtownbutler, and in Fermanagh have all gone. Normality has been restored. Perhaps people who are not familiar with the Border terrain would not realise the hardship inflicted on communities through the severing of links across the Border, whether between Cavan and Fermanagh or Monaghan and Tyrone.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Today, although we have not reached our goal of an operational Executive and an elected Assembly, we have made great progress. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who have contributed enormously to the advancement of the peace process. They will ensure the will of the people, as mandated in the referenda in 1998, will be implemented and that the changes sought by all the people on the island will be effected at the earliest opportunity.</p>

As our Sinn Féin colleagues reminded us, it is good to be doing this in a week when many of us went to Arbour Hill to commemorate the men and women who gave their lives in 1916. I am reminded of it this week because I worked in the city centre at the time of the 1974 bombings and will never forget that day. It behoves all of us to pause tomorrow and remember those who died on that occasion. I would also like to confirm my admiration for the long and at times frustrating work which my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Taoiseach, and his officials have done over the years to assist in the normalisation of life for people in the North, particularly in the commitment to equality between the two traditions. While in no way an expert on the subject, I can and do follow developments in the programme begun on Good Friday 1998 and built on since.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">There are other good people in Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The Patten report included a number of principles and, while the implementation has taken a long time, the fact is that the Police Service of Northern Ireland now exists. I hope that in the near future, it will receive the support of all elected political parties in the North and become, as envisaged, a fully supported community police force administering the law in all areas and a trusted impartial point of contact that will result in the cycle of punishment beatings engaged in by both communities being viewed by the population as unacceptable. The Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland will share common areas that will need to be addressed. Both parts of this island have a criminal culture where drugs, violence and murder are the norm, requiring the Garda and the PSNI to adopt similar responses.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The Bill represents this Government's commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and I wish to point out the recommendations on cross-Border co-operation as outlined in the Patten report. I fully support the Minister, Deputy McDowell, when he states that this Bill is a further part of the confidence building necessary to improve the level of cross-community trust in the impartiality of the criminal justice system. Of course, like other Members, I wish him continued success in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">While the Bill adequately lays out the conditions whereby a member of the PSNI or a garda can be seconded or appointed to certain ranks and the consequences and time involved, it also states that the number of possible secondments will be prescribed. I would like to see that figure, when agreed, as a performance indicator published in the Garda Síochána's annual report. In the agreement between the Governments on police co-operation in April 2002, there were 12 articles. This Bill, which covers Articles 1 and 2, might also have included Article 4, which provides for an annual conference to be convened between the two forces. The benefits of a three-day conference of members of both forces discussing common issues and experiences would help encourage cross-community confidence and serve political and enforcement development constructively.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I have pointed out that I am not an expert on this subject, but it is important that we support the Bill and take account of what is happening on our island, supporting the parties in trying to move normality forward. Last week, quite by accident, I had an opportunity to speak to the SDLP leader, Mark Durkan, who was visiting the House. I made the point – and I am sure he will not mind my repeating it – that those of us privileged enough to be public representatives who involve ourselves in the lives of our constituents all have the same problems day in, day out. Even as we speak, my constituency office in Tallaght is under siege from a group of protesters. That is fair enough in a democracy and I have no problem with it as long as they do not upset those of my constituents who want to engage me. I have no problem with protest. All of us go about our business dealing with matters and I made the point to Mark Durkan that people come to me about mundane matters such as broken footpaths and trees, the environment, housing and so on. He told me he gets the same problems which I am sure is true of all colleagues in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The serious point which I wish to make is that, while all politicians in the North go about their business as we do, dealing with all the problems of their constituents, they also have to deal with the problems, dangers and intimidation of the North. That is something we should consider. I appreciate the freedom that we have in the South. However, we should remember our colleagues in the North and this is an occasion to express that support. I strongly support this legislation. I wish the Minister well and I hope that Members across the House will support the Bill, which is good legislation. We are all entitled to make party political points. I have no problem doing that but I look forward to the passing of the Bill. I am happy to commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_39">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_114">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which I might term the "Garda Síochána (police corruption) Bill 2003". I welcome the contributions from all sides of the House. However, I will take a different position and be a dissenting voice on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The Bill has come at a critical time in our history. We are now at the stage where the island of Ireland needs a police force that we can trust and respect. That police force must be community-based, enjoying the respect and support of all our people. The police must earn confidence and respect, for the days of demanding respect are gone forever. They must earn it before we can go forward. There can be no room for corruption or cover-ups in any police force, North or South. That is the reality. As someone who has worked in the inner city for 20 years, I have seen examples of both good and disastrous policing. I have seen how gardaí involved in the drugs squad earned the respect of the community in the poorer sections of society, for they went in to work and liaise with people and were straight with them. They were not playing games. Recent history has shown us, however, that there is a long way to go before we have a quality police service.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Now there is a glorious opportunity. We must start looking at new ideas and I welcome some of those which Ministers have thrown on the table for debate over the last few weeks. We need a quality police force. Some of the Patten proposals have given us a blueprint, and we should look seriously at the positive aspects of Patten and adopt them immediately. The future is important, as the whole community is crying out for a quality police service. As legislators, we have a major role to play. We must listen to the people's views and put them into law in this House. Any law steeped in the community will always have the respect of all its citizens and that is what this debate is about today.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">However, we cannot allow ourselves to make the same mistakes as in the past, as has been proved in recent days. We should never allow ourselves to be pushed into supporting legislation under pressure or at the wrong time. The reality is that many people have major concerns about the PSNI and its record of human rights abuses. There is a serious gap in confidence, particularly in the Northern minority and human rights groups in the North. They are at the coalface each day and know the reality, and we have a duty to listen to them. Sadly, the majority of Members of this House do not listen enough to people on the ground in the North, and that is one of the aspects in which we are going wrong in this debate. I disagree with many of the views put forward by the three major political parties, particularly regarding support for the Northern minority. It is simply not acceptable for police forces to be involved in shoot to kill policies, collusion and death squads, and then have the brass neck to expect confidence and support from the people. That is not on.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">When we start to criticise bad policing tactics or bad policing in general, the labelling brigade, of which there are many members in the House, refer to us as being anti-police, which is a load of rubbish. It does not mean that we do not support good, decent and honest policing. I am particularly aware of this and I always make a point of praising good practice, whether in the North or the South, with regard to community policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">I have spoken with many from the North and been informed that, despite the Good Friday Agreement, there are still major problems there and that they are still concerned about the absence of quality and impartiality in their policing. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, and his party should speak to these people more often and listen to their views. If they had a police service that would act as an independent and honest broker, it would receive community support. This should be our objective. The reality is that there are genuine fears that people who were involved in collusion and in people's deaths are still on the force. They are still in the special branch and their credibility is on the line. This is a view one will not hear in Dublin 4. One may also not here it in the vicinity of the Houses too often. I have spoken with the people concerned and that is their honest and clear position.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Police co-operation has got to be based on trust and confidence. At present, and particularly in recent days, my trust and confidence in the PSNI has been seriously undermined. When I listened to the evidence that a policeman was involved in some way with Michael Stone on the day of the massacre in Milltown cemetery and when people such as Rosemary Nelson, who stood up for human rights in the Six Counties, were murdered, is it not right for people like me to ask serious questions about credibility?</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I have heard people speak about the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. I worked in Dorset Street for 20 years and the father of one of my pupils was blown to bits on that day and one of the two O'Neills, who were past pupils, was seriously injured. When individuals say that there is a good chance that state security forces were in some way involved in that campaign, we have got to look seriously at these issues and people have got to speak out. We have to look at the issues of trust, credibility and respect. When one asks these questions one is doing a service to the community and also to the policemen and women on this island who are good and decent and who go out and do their day's work and are constantly undermined by such elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">As soon as a political conflict is brought into policing, impartiality goes out the window. This can be seen in the Middle East. Will a Palestinian get a fair trial is Israel? Will an Israeli be treated to a fair trial by the Palestinians? These are the issues that arise if there is interference. We have to decide that political conflicts can damage impartial policing. I am not saying that we have to constantly live and move in the past. I shall return to that issue later.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Yesterday, there was another classic example of bad policing. I met the family of the jockey, Christy McGrath, who visited the Dáil and met many of us. Christy McGrath is a 24 year old jump jockey from Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, who has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a person in July 2000. Christy has repeatedly denied that he was responsible for this man's death and is seeking an immediate appeal against this unjust conviction. Having listened to the family and to a delegation from England, I am absolutely convinced that there has been another grave miscarriage of justice. On leaving the pub on the night in question, Christy McGrath was attacked, racially abused and assaulted by a particular person. In attempting to gain entrance to the pub, Christy was again attacked by the person with a brick and he was forced to defend himself. This person was alive when Christy left the scene. Later, however, two other men wearing balaclavas are known to have approached the person who attacked Christy. One returned to the scene more than once and the body was found the following morning on the ground. The person who died was the victim of strangulation. He was strangled with such force that the neck vertebrae were broken. This gentleman was over six foot and heavily built. Christy is a small jockey, a slightly built shorter man.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Throughout the course of the investigations police referred to him as the "Irish lad". He had no motive to kill this person. Christy tried to avoid the fight by running back to the pub. Witnesses in Christy's favour were never heard. One admitted washing blood-stained clothes and another reported seeing a murder by men in balaclavas. Police claim they are unable to state the time of the person's death. Christy only learned that the victim had died of strangulation after he pleaded guilty in court. That is an example of very bad policing. It involves an Irish citizen in England and is similar to the cases of the Birmingham Six or the Guilford Four.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Christy McGrath's family and their supporters have asked me to support their call for the immediate referral of his case to the court of appeal. An investigation into the killing should be reopened as a matter of urgency. Things have not changed much. We have got to look seriously at this entire question.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">When I travelled to South America to act as an observer at the trial of the Colombia three, I spoke with trade unionists whose colleagues and friends were killed by right-wing death squads linked to the military. I raised this question with the Colombian Minister for Justice. A few days later, at a meeting with human rights groups, I discovered that the state security person responsible for these massacres was promoted and was moved abroad to work in an embassy. That smacks of Brigadier Kerr and the FRU.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">We have seen similar situations in the North. The Pat Finucane case is one that immediately comes to mind. He was one of the best human rights lawyers in the world. Many looked upon him as a Steve Biko of the North. Many other innocent civilians suffered the same fate at the hands of security forces. People should not have the brass neck to come in here and demand support for the Bill when there is a major policing crisis at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">We cannot allow ourselves to be bullied into passing legislation because a particular Government wants to apply pressure at a time when there are major doubts and concerns about human rights issues. There is also the question of protecting the democratic process. If some in the PSNI, particularly those who were directly involved, are allowed to continue to operate and if the British Government continues to demand support while it postpones democratic elections or supports collusion, one loses one's self-respect and dignity and the respect of the people. In the end, we will all lose. It is time for deep reflection. We need cool heads, clear thinking and the ability not to be rushed into passing this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I strongly support the idea of a truth and reconciliation forum to deal with the various issues – such as people's suffering and the question of policing – to which the conflict has given rise. Then we can all hopefully move on and have a bright future for policing in this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">I also wish to refer to the horrific drugs crisis in this country. We have recently seen vicious attacks on our streets, particularly those of the capital city. Most people in the know will say that there is a direct connection between alcohol abuse and young people taking cocaine, which is leading to excessive violence and massive anti-social behaviour on the streets. This matter will have to be given careful consideration. A part of this plan has got to be a quality policy service. People in the communities must admire and respect their policemen. This must apply to everybody. I say the same about every other public servant – teachers, doctors, city council workers. If one is a public servant, one is working for the public and is paid out of taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">I referred earlier to the need for confidence building measures. The Stevens report was amazing in that it led to the question of collusion entering the public domain. One arm of the State has indicated that this is a major problem and that a crisis exists, while Members in this House expect the rest of us to row in and support the legislation. We have got to ask some difficult questions. I mentioned the trial of the Colombia three. It seems that if any Member gets involved in human rights issues, they are suddenly labelled. There was a hysterical reaction in the Dáil and in the media when I travelled to Colombia as an independent observer. They tried to bully me off the pitch. They even succeeded in bullying other Deputies from different parties. Sadly, some of those who issued the hysterical reaction were from the Minister's party. We went out there as observers to see that the three Irish citizens got a fair trial. When they are acquitted, people will see that we made the right call. I have spoken with American legal people in recent weeks and they are convinced there is no evidence against these three people.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">While there, I had the honour of meeting trade unionists. They are being shot down in a way that reminds me of the sectarian killings in the North over the past nine or ten years. Shop stewards in Coca-Cola plants are being killed by death squads that are linked to the military, yet the people in Colombia are asked to have respect for policing. I heard from the families and lawyers involved in some of these cases and this reminded me of some of what went on in the North over the past 30 years. The vast majority of people in Colombia want a peace process like ours. They also want an independent peace-broker to help them out of the rut they are in. When we returned we made many submissions; I gave a report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The threat to the equality agenda must also be raised when talking about the policing issue. I am referring particularly to the question of race. We must have a police service that respects all nationalities and ethnic minorities and treats everyone in the same way. There have been cases where this did not happen. There are people who are trying to encourage racism in this society and they should be dealt with head-on. All political parties should be constantly vigilant of the elements in our society that want to stir up the race issue. We have seen the rise of the British National Party in the local elections in England which is a cause of concern to many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I listened to Deputy Conor Lenihan speak earlier about living in the past. I do not live in the past – I have a vision for, and believe in, the future. We cannot move into the future without dealing with the past. Issues cannot be brushed aside and forgotten. The issues must be dealt with, a line can be drawn in the sand and then we can move on. This is the way to deal with a peace process. This is why I support the idea of a truth and reconciliation forum. We must let people release their hurt and anger. If there was collusion and massacres, we must face up to it and then move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The Northern minority has shown tremendous courage over the past 30 years. I have many friends who moved from the North to Dublin because of the Troubles. They constantly say how excluded they felt here for many years as no one was prepared to listen to their views. The peace process has given us an opportunity to have debates like this where Members can speak openly and not look over their shoulder or be labelled by elements in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">When listening to Deputies from both sides of the House, I often wonder if they have ever sat down and spoke to residents of the Short Strand in Belfast. I have met them on numerous occasions and they have told me about the circumstances in which they live and shown me video evidence of the sectarian attacks on their houses at night time. I have great respect for their integrity and patience. A group came to Coolock one evening and gave a talk. There were no representatives in attendance from the major political parties and I was saddened for their sake by this. I encourage Members to listen to the views of such people. When one listens to them, one realises that major problems exist. When one realises this, one can do something about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I do not want to see a simple name change for a police force. I do not believe in PR gimmicks or spin – I believe in real change and radical reform. I agree with comments made by some Deputies that when talking about policing, there must be real change, equality and justice. We must also ensure the nightmarish reality of the Northern minority experience is listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Policing must be linked to the democratic process. Circumstances cannot exist where a British Prime Minister postpones elections on this island. I do not accept this; it is undemocratic and damaging to the peace process. We must remember that when we talk about the peace process, it is a process for change in our society. Incidentally, I supported the peace process long before it was trendy and fashionable to do so and before there was a cessation of violence from any group. I worked on these issues for years through community groups. I visited the North many times and talked to Nationalists and Unionists and became involved in different groups. All the time, the key message was that something had to be done about policing. Policing must be part of the peace process and must be built on respect for human rights. If that respect does not exist, the process will go nowhere and fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Deputies do not often get the chance to air their views in a manner as widespread as this. I recently asked the Taoiseach a question about representing the views of our citizens. While the views of citizens can be strongly represented, one can still negotiate. One does not have to cave in at the first instance – one can be strong and negotiate.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Policing on this island must be built on trust and respect. I have major doubts about the timing of this legislation. The timing of the Bill is not appropriate because of the evidence that has come to light in recent days.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_40">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_141">I wish to share my time with Deputy Eoin Ryan.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I welcome the Bill and strongly support it. It provides for the policing principles provided for in the Good Friday Agreement and is clearly another step in the implementation of the Patten report. This report is hugely important to the progress of policing in Northern Ireland. This Bill creates formal links between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to the benefit of communities North and South and both communities in the North in the areas of crime prevention and detection. It is also important in giving confidence in the police service to many communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Nine of the 175 recommendations of the report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland specifically refer to co-operation with the Garda. This Bill implements Articles 1 and 2 of the intergovernmental agreement. Article 5 of that agreement refers mainly to training and the transfer of experience and expertise. This is already happening and is provided for between the Chief Constable and the Garda authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The police service in Northern Ireland is of the greatest importance. There is no doubt that the RUC did not have the confidence of entire communities, not just individuals, in Northern Ireland and there was good reason for this. The Patten report acknowledged this and made a large number of recommendations to address these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">If they wish to participate in what I will term "orderly politics", the parties in the North have an onus on them, arising from the Good Friday Agreement, to play a positive role in the police service. This means joining the policing board and the local boards. All Members must acknowledge that there are political and electoral realities at play. People will always jockey for position and political advantage. We must honestly acknowledge that the parties in the North will make such judgments just as parties in other democracies do.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I agree strongly with Deputy Brendan Smith that the role the SDLP has managed to play on the board is very significant in terms of advancements for the Nationalist community in the North. It would be greatly helped if Sinn Féin found it possible to join the policing board and the local boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I am sorry I missed some of Deputy Ó Caoláin's contribution but he seemed to make a reasonable point on co-operation in the past and the passing of information between the police forces of the North and South. He made the point that it is entirely possible that some of the information passed from the South found its way through the murky system comprising elements of the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries. It found its way to some of the gangs and may well have contributed to the murder of people such as Pat Finucane or Rosemary Nelson – the most high-profile cases – and many others. Clearly, Deputy Ó Caoláin was not in a position to present evidence that this is the case but he was making a reasonable point when he said it was possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Arising from this and all the other elements of the murky underbelly of British intelligence and paramilitary activity in the North, we must commit ourselves to establishing the truth behind these and similar issues. However, it would be far better if this were done through the courts than through the investigating systems we have invented, North and South, which seem to run interminably and very frequently reach either no conclusion or no very clear conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">We must also advert to the reality that much of the information that passed between the police forces of the North and South concerned far more ordinary policing, particularly the attempt to combat the movement of drugs. During the debate, there has been much emphasis on co-operation arising from the paramilitary and sectarian activity. Naturally, that attracted a high level of publicity and informed much of the debate. However, there are major issues concerning ordinary policing that will be facilitated by the passing of this Bill. These range from traffic offences to the hugely important area of trying to combat drug dealing.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">It is true, as Deputy Finian McGrath has said, that the experience of policing in Northern communities in the years of the RUC was horrendously negative. He was quite wrong to suggest that Members of the larger political parties, on all sides of the House, are not aware of this. I represent a constituency to which a huge number of people fled from Northern Ireland, to Shannon in particular. I know many of these people very well and know a great deal about their experiences. I have also had the opportunity, as a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, to visit and talk to communities in the North in their community centres and, more importantly, to listen to their experiences and be informed by them. We must not seek to deny that the experience of Catholic and Nationalist communities, particularly in the cities and larger towns, was extremely negative. We have to move forward. There has been no more significant step than the adoption of the majority of the Patten proposals and the Bill before the House is hugely important in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The implementation of the criminal justice review is just as important as the policing issue in the context of normalisation in the North. I am very disappointed that it has not been possible to make much greater progress. No progress can be made in the absence of the Assembly. The establishment of an independent public prosecution service, a Northern Ireland Attorney General's office will be helpful and major changes to the judicial appointment system in the North will be very far-reaching and just as important as the major changes that need to be implemented in terms of policing. It is very important that all the parties in the North play their part and be prepared to serve on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">In this debate we also need to advert to the fact that every democracy has to develop an effective and high-quality police force, and policing in the South has some lessons to learn from the Patten proposals. An overwhelming majority of policemen and policewomen are excellent, professional people. Sometimes one feels that resources could be better organised and I welcome the Minister's initiatives in this regard. Much work has to be done and clearly there are difficulties, as we have seen in respect of Abbeylara and the Donegal cases etc. There is undoubtedly a case for the establishment of a police ombudsman's office in the Republic. I have had the pleasure of meeting the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and have no doubt that she is committed to addressing the issues in a fair, impartial and quite tough manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I also met the board of the PSNI and was equally impressed with its commitment to developing a policing system that serves and belongs to all the communities and does an effective job. I have met several Chief Constables and have determined that one of the advantages arising from the Patten report is that the principle of transfer from other jurisdictions and policing areas has been implemented in the North. The emphasis on ordinary policing is very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I also had the pleasure of visiting the police training college in Belfast and meeting several of the new recruits and people who are being trained. I was shocked to find that some people from the Nationalist community found extreme difficulty in continuing to participate as trainees and playing their part in the force. That is simply unacceptable and not the way to go forward. However, it was interesting that the issues raised by the recruits we met were mainly very ordinary trade union type issues. They were very serious issues, which we were glad to raise with the policing board subsequently. I am glad to hear that some progress has been made in respect of them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoinRyan" eId="spk_41">
          <from>Mr. Eoin Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_155">I, too, welcome this important and innovative Bill to the House. In Northern Ireland a process often takes place of taking two steps forward and one step backwards. It is good to see something positive emerging and things moving forward in the right direction. As many Deputies have said, it is very important that the police forces of the North and South have the respect of their local communities and of everybody. When one looks at the revelations now emerging in the North about what happened over the years in respect of the RUC, we must welcome a Bill like this – it represents a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The Patten report made 175 recommendations, nine of which dealt specifically with the Garda and the PSNI. After the report was published there was much debate on it on all sides and it certainly upset many people. The measure under discussion is grounded in an agreement that was signed on April 2002 between the two Governments and it has to be welcomed. It is a good measure. Of course one can say we should not go forward with it for the reasons many people have outlined, which are hard to argue against, but we have to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Formalising links between the two police forces is a step in the right direction and has the potential to address many of the fears of some sections of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland. There have always been many links between the two forces but these will now be formalised. This will lead to better policing on both sides, enabling them to better deal with terrorism, drugs, smuggling and organised crime – problems that need to be addressed. As a Minister of State in the previous Government, I was involved in addressing the issue of drugs. Many communities around the country, especially in Dublin, have expressed grave concern that the paramilitary groups are behind many of the drugs shipments coming into the country and making money out of distributing them to poorer communities. This legislation will help to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The legislation will also pave the way for better community policing. We must all learn about this aspect. The Garda Síochána has embarked on a couple of pilot schemes on advancing community policing, which is to be welcomed. We need to see more of this. It will be beneficial if the Garda can learn from the PSNI in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I am glad that there will be enhanced co-operation across a number of areas, especially on the question of the involvement by paramilitary groups in the sale of drugs. There is huge concern in many parts of inner city Dublin and the wider suburbs where heroin has been a huge problem that paramilitary groups are involved, making huge amounts of money and funding themselves through the sale of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Deputy Finian McGrath referred to the situation in Colombia. I spent a year in Latin America. It is an area that has always fascinated me. It is simplistic for the Deputy to suggest that the problems in the region are the result of the activities of death squads funded and backed by governments. It has been an unfortunate part of the history of Latin America that left wing groups have been murdered by extreme right wing groups within governments and <i>vica versa</i> whenever left wing groups were in power. Thankfully, that has been stamped out in many countries and democratic governments have taken over.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The problem in Colombia is centred on the fact that people making billions of dollars from the sale of drugs control large parts of the country. It is a huge problem. Reports from those who take a balanced approach to the country testify to this. I do not condone the death squads, which are probably backed by the Colombian military. Many years ago I spent some time in the country when it was very peaceful, had a reasonably good government and a very good judicial system, one of the best in Latin America. Unfortunately, drug barons have taken over. This cannot be ignored. Huge amounts of money are involved. A friend of mine is married to a Colombian who had to leave the country because of threats. He can tell stories of what happened to him and some of those in certain communities in the country who tried to stand up to the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The intergovernmental agreement on which this Bill is based provides for three levels of personal exchange between both police forces. Article 1 provides that members of each police force are eligible to apply for certain posts in the other police service; Article 2 provides that a programme is to be put in place to enable members of each police service to be seconded with full police powers to the other for periods not exceeding three years while Article 5 provides that a programme of placements is to be put in place to enable the transfer of experience and expertise in the area of training. I cannot understand how anybody could argue against these measures. While mistakes may have been made in the past, I hope we can understand that by embarking on this we will progress the entire process. Greater trust between the two police forces is required and must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">These provisions will create new opportunities for the members of both police forces to gain experience. It must be good if officers from both sides can see how things operate in the other jurisdiction. The transfer of persons from the private sector to local authorities and <i>vice versa</i> has added new dimensions to both. For example, the transfer by Owen Keegan from the private sector to head the traffic department at Dublin City Council is a good example, even though he has been subjected to much criticism for some of his decisions. People may not always agree with his approach but he has brought a new dimension to the city council's traffic department. Closer co-operation and agreements of this kind have the potential to achieve similar results for both police forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I congratulate the SDLP for its role on this issue. The party has taken a brave decision to back it. Sinn Féin should consider taking a similar approach. Its want to move the process forward. One way of doing this is to support the kind of co-operation envisaged in the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_42">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I listened with interest to the various speeches from this and the other side of the House. Time changes everything. Some time ago, a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Séamus Mallon, said the Good Friday Agreement was Sunningdale for slow learners. If he listened to this debate, he would see greater evidence for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The Anglo-Irish Agreement was ridiculed on the other side of the House. The then main Opposition party embarked on a major campaign, including an unpatriotic worldwide diplomatic offensive, to undermine it. However, time heals and changes everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I have no doubt that for many reasons this initiative will be beneficial. It represents a sea-change and may have dramatic implications. While it may be hugely at variance with many of the things said and done by both sets of groups on both parts of the island, it is good and an exercise in evolution which must take account of prevailing thinking. Evolution moves us on, sometimes slowly, with some moving more slowly than others. I often wonder if we should spend more time thinking about the divisions which existed in the past and how they have to be addressed or if we should try to bridge the gap to put in place the means to ensure we do not trip over the handle of the hatchet we bury. It is very easy for us to bring things up. Like everybody in this House, I remember the Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson affairs and I understand, as we all do, that things were not as they should have been. That does not mean we should fail to move to improve matters and to put in place the measures and mechanisms which are likely to encourage a new generation of thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I had occasion some time ago to meet a group of Palestinians. There is an analogy to be drawn between the Middle East and Northern Ireland where religion, politics, tradition and history exist on all sides. The Palestinians I met were very convincing in the case they put, but they had only one side of the story and did not want to hear the other. We suffer from the same problem in this country. I remember saying to the group I met that it would be beneficial if suicide bombings stopped and the Israelis stopped shooting at Palestinian homes and townships. They could not see it that way for they saw only one side. There was no question of a suicide bomber creating any problem and I am sure that if I spoke to an Israeli representative I would receive a similar response.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">We must look at ourselves and recognise that we perpetuate a wrong by bringing it up again and again and calling for retribution. I do not know if such actions will ever solve our problems. We have not solved them so far but we have travelled some distance towards doing so and there has been some improvement. I remember well Garret FitzGerald's suggestion many years ago that it would be a good idea to provide for some overlapping or integration of police thinking on the two sides of this island. I remember the hundreds of thousands of leaflets which were printed and handed out door to door to protest and I know where they came from. I am sure other Members of this House know where they came from too. Night after night, the leaflets were distributed to scare the Irish people into believing that they might wake up to find the B Specials on their doorsteps. It was dramatic stuff to convince the general public, but it was aimed at nothing more than achieving a cheap political objective. That happened in the lifetime of many Members of this House and I mention it to illustrate where we have come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">When I first entered this House fiery speeches were regularly made which were, to say the least, an incitement. I am sure such behaviour contributed to certain thinking and while it may have salved the wounds of one side, it did nothing to preserve peace or lives. We have learned a little in this House and we have come on. Things have changed considerably and this Bill is in keeping with that. The future will not be easy. There will be ditches, snags, disappointments and problems, but we will have to work at them. The process will not work on its own. We have to do something with it and support it. I do not wish to lecture anybody on this side of the House or the other, but much of the process will involve trust and trustworthiness. We will have to trust those whom we did not trust and we must prove trustworthy ourselves. If we do not cross that Rubicon, we will not go anywhere. If we think we have bridged the great gap, we are wrong. We must work to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">A number of speakers have said that in order to be trustworthy we must have confidence in our institutions. We must have confidence in cross-Border police co-operation and we must be able to support it. If we stand aloof from it and deny that it can work, then it will not succeed. If people on either side in the North of Ireland stand aloof from the process and declare that it does not have their confidence, it cannot work. Police co-operation must have the support of the people. Deputy Finian McGrath referred to community policing. Community policing must have the support of the population. The colonial history of this country has not been conducive to support for institutions. Occasionally, a tragedy such as the death of Veronica Guerin occurs and we come on side saying that something must be done. We drift away after a little while when we start to qualify our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">In the process in which we are now involved, it is of critical importance that support for the proposal before the House comes from both parts of this island, both communities in the North of Ireland and all political thinking in the Republic. We must point the finger at glitches which occur and address them. The process must be transparent, above board, accountable and capable of being checked and balanced as necessary. If all those criteria are not met or there is an element of a fudge, it will not work. Police co-operation will fall into disrepute and the people will distrust it. We support the process, but the process itself must be seen to be accountable, transparent, workable and working or it will fail. Were it to fail, it would be a great pity and a huge disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">We should all do what we can to make progress in a positive direction. If we cannot, we must be able to explain without a political agenda why the process is not working. If we do not allow the process to get off the ground in the first place, it is unacceptable to say that it did not work and that we did not agree with it anyway. It does not work that way now and it did not work that way with Sunningdale or the Anglo-Irish Agreement. As Séamus Mallon said, the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report are for slow learners. It took 30 years for the penny to drop, which is a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Mention has also been made of the Garda and the discomfort we sometimes suffer as a result of the odd glitch that appears on the scene. The same applies to the PSNI. Any new arrangement is only as strong as its weakest link. Therefore, it is important we recognise that the police must be trustworthy, have the confidence of the people and set the standards that will command, as opposed to demand, their confidence. If things go wrong and require clarification or something appears which needs to be dealt with, it must be done on both sides. There are procedures in the legislation whereby disciplinary action can be taken on both sides in the event of something going wrong. Sections 5 and 6 refer to those areas and it is important we bear in mind what the sections contain because we cannot accept one part of the Bill because it suits us and reject another because it does not. That is a typical Irish characteristic which we have always had, so why would we change?</p>
          <p eId="para_175">We must all recognise that this is part and parcel of the new proposals and we must be above board. We must be supportive of our police but we need to ensure that any investigations are carried out in a fair, open and transparent manner. As we know, the ombudsman in Northern Ireland has had some considerable reservations. We have an investigative system which many people do not feel is the ultimate in terms of a complaints system, although changes will come about. This does not mean we do not support the Garda Síochána but, in order to give our full and wholesome support, it is important that we have the confidence necessary in its ability and willingness to carry out its duties in strict accordance with the rules, regulations and guidelines with no exceptions. Otherwise, we are in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I understand how it can be difficult for some politicians in the North to give their full support to the police force. They say that the force should be disbanded and that the name change is insufficient. I do not think a name change makes a lot of difference. The ingredients that are put into the force in the first place are what make the difference – the commitment that is made and given. In 1922, the police force changed, its name changed and many people changed over to it. However, the whole concept and attitude changed too. There were glitches along the way but, by and large, we had to evolve. It may be difficult to do so, especially when traditionally and for political and other reasons a group in society has not been supportive of the police. I appreciate and understand those difficulties. This is from where Deputy Finian McGrath was coming when he referred to community policing. There must be liaison with the community which requires policing and which the police require for support. If that is lacking and the antipathy and rejection of the police remains, at what stage will we say there exists a group of people who will protect our citizens, look after our interests and have our confidence – and we theirs – if we do not evolve, try to cross the bridge and meet them half way?</p>
          <p eId="para_177">That may not be a bad idea for us in politics in terms of dealing with Northern Ireland issues. It is not, has never been and never will be, simple. It is not the case that, once the Good Friday Agreement had been signed, one could walk away from it and say it was all over. The recent glitches prove that the situation requires continuous working and support and an examination of the problems that arise from time to time and are likely to cause a glitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">It is sad that the elections promised in Northern Ireland are not taking place. In a vacuum, other things seem to take over. A vacuum exists where politics subsides. It is impossible to set aside the difficulties of 30 years in a short space of time and try to reconstruct thinking and society and its institutions in one fell swoop. However, we must continue to try. In principle, I support the proposals. It is part of an evolution which must take place. It is up to us all to work at it. We could, for political purposes, stand aside from it and snipe at it, in which case nothing will work. Ultimately, we could find ourselves retracing the steps of the last 30 years, which no one wants to do.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_43">
          <from>Ms Hoctor</from>
          <p eId="para_179">Táim buíoch as seans a fháil labhairt os comhair an Tí ar an mBille tábhachtach seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I welcome this innovative initiative taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and I congratulate him on this significant step which will no doubt be an important link in strengthening relations already well established between the Republic and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The Bill is a natural progression to implement the Patten report, formalising the links between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. With a rapidly changing society, there are increasing demands on police forces everywhere. Figures reveal to us the sophisticated measures now taken by criminals in the trafficking of drugs, in terrorism and, regrettably, the trafficking of human beings. As crime becomes more sophisticated, the police forces which work with and protect the people must also become more sophisticated and use all the skills already acquired in their co-operative training to work towards the protection of the people, which is of paramount importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The Good Friday Agreement, signed in April 1998, pitched its success on the level of co-operation which was envisaged in the years to follow. Of the 175 recommendations of the Patten report, nine referred to co-operation with the Garda Síochána. The passing of this legislation may only enhance the position of police in effective cross-Border policing, the fight against terrorism, drugs smuggling and organised crime. Therefore it is most important that our police forces become all the more organised and focused on the crime that comes our way. We often see disorganised, unplanned crime on our streets, but it is important to deal with organised crime also, and there is no doubt this Bill will enhance the co-operation that is badly needed on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Positive measures already under way in the police forces of the North and South are warmly welcomed. The Garda training college in Templemore, in my constituency, hosted the first annual conference of the PSNI jointly with the Garda Síochána last year and I understand the second will be held later in the year. That is only indicative of the work already going on, which has been successful, proving that co-operation actually works. Great commendation must be given to the joint emergency planning currently under way between the two police forces, in which simulated exercises are being carried out. This no doubt paves the way for this Bill, which I hope will receive a speedy passage through the House. I understand that EU member states have been involved in the assessment of the simulated exercises. It is good for us to see that although this is a very small island, the EU recognises the need for co-operation between North and South. No doubt we have its approval as we endeavour to have this Bill passed in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Positive progress would not have come about but for the co-operation of many people. I pay tribute to the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, and to the Chief Constable and the others who have worked on the Border. We saw their work during the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001. Co-operation was evident and obviously worked to the benefit of everybody here. I had occasion recently to visit the Templemore training college and was encouraged and reassured by seeing more than 120 students graduate on that day and be assigned to stations all over the country. We have improved in the training of our gardaí. Not so long ago students underwent a programme only six months long before being sent to various stations, but with the two-year training programme currently in place, they are far better equipped and informed, as they need to be to address all the issues they deal with on a daily basis. There is no doubt that these skills will be invaluable in cross-Border co-operation, which will be intensified on the passing of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">It is the responsibility of the Members of the House to carry out our mandate, given under the Good Friday Agreement, of working towards greater unity on this island. For Deputy Finian McGrath to use the word "bullying" was out of order, to say the least. Those of us with a sense of civic duty feel a compulsion to enable every possible channel of co-operation for those who are already successfully proving that co-operation works. I am pleased the Fine Gael Party has lent its support to the Bill. Its members have made several references to Dr. Garret FitzGerald and his initiative 20 years ago. Deputy Durkan spoke of confidence – the confidence we have in our police force and, although this was questioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Northern police force. I was only a child at the time, but I believe that confidence was not there when that proposal was made by Dr. FitzGerald. Things are different now, after the events of the peace process and the advancement of all our aspirations as a people of this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I was surprised and disappointed to hear the aspirations of Deputy Ó Caoláin, who one would think would espouse unity here. Surely this is a positive measure towards unity. We live in an imperfect world, in which there are poor farmers, doctors and nurses in very small minorities, poor teachers – I was a teacher before entering the house here – and poor politicians, because we are human and we have imperfections. Surely the imperfections, about which we could all speak if we wished, should not stand in the way of an innovative initiative taken by the Minister to unite the police forces of the island. Most certainly, in unity will be greater strength.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">We have never had as many gardaí as we have now, with approximately 11,000 members, and that is to be welcomed. I understand this initiative will afford the opportunity to members of the Garda to volunteer to work in the North. If a large number of people wish to take advantage of this option, what measures will be taken to ensure that they are replaced, so that we do not end up with a deficiency in numbers? The Minister knows from hearing me speak on previous occasions that all the gardaí we have are badly needed, particularly in rural areas. The village of Lorrha in north Tipperary had a sergeant and a garda until last year; now it has neither. There is a beautiful Garda station with a house attached, only built in the past 20 years, which is now empty. The crime rate in Lorrha would have been next to nil, but it was nil because we had a Garda presence there. Now we have none. The people of Lorrha wish for the replacement of those two gardaí, who served the people so well in the past. If transferring to Northern Ireland becomes an attractive option, which it will for some members of the force, we should have measures in place so that the transfer and co-operation would be monitored and the numbers currently in place here in the Republic would remain stable. We should not end up with a deficiency in numbers because of this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">There is a need for the enforcement of certain laws, as discussed by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. People are concerned about such issues as liquor licensing laws and immigration. There is no doubt that we will need increasing numbers of gardaí and I know the Minister is doing his best to implement this in Templemore. I hope after the passing of this Bill, which I strongly support, the numbers of gardaí in the Republic will remain stable and that a similar number will come to us from Northern Ireland if there is strong interest in the exchange process among our gardaí. I am pleased to have had the time to speak on this issue. I welcome the Bill and support it. It deserves a speedy passage through the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I do not know about other Members of the House, but I have had the opportunity of meeting the RUC special branch. It may seem that this is perhaps a controversial thing for an Irish republican to say. In the course of our interview, I made a request to have my solicitor present. The members of the special branch occupied the time until the solicitor turned up by demonstrating to me some of their torture techniques. They were pretty good at strangulation and suffocation, but I cannot elaborate on that because on at least three occasions, I passed out. To their credit, they revived me fairly quickly, although they denied me a glass of water, which is one of the critical things in a suffocation case. I was probably one of the luckier ones: I know a man from Belfast, John Maguire, who, the RUC claimed, jumped out the upstairs window of a police station, cracking his skull on the yard outside so that he almost died. There were many cases like that. That special branch is still there, intact and answerable to nobody except itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Deputies should reject this Bill because it is hanging Northern Nationalists out to dry yet again. I use the phrase "yet again" because, since the foundation of the Northern state, the political system in this State has systematically hung Northern Nationalists out to dry. People on this side of the Border knew all about the employment discrimination; they knew all about the gerrymandering that was going on all across the North. The politicians in this State did nothing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The comment that the Good Friday Agreement is Sunningdale for slow learners was made by a person who is the slowest learner of them all, or else he would have realised that the whole equality agenda that is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement was totally missing from Sunningdale. Missing also are many of the all-Ireland institutions and the features of accountability which are built into the agreement such as the policing ombudsman. The person who made that comment about slow learners will come to regret having done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Suggestions have been made outside the House that the Bill is really about mixing some of the good – by which, I presume, is meant the Garda – with some of the bad – by which, I have no doubt, is meant the core of the old RUC that is still represented in the PSNI. Is that an accountable all-Ireland policing force? I think not.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">To consider the good, so to speak, the events at Abbeylara and Donegal have been mentioned and we know of many other individual cases. At recent Easter Rising commemoration ceremonies, I saw detectives sitting in squad cars and in unmarked cars watching republicans assemble to commemorate the men and women of 1916. There were three carloads of detectives sitting and watching people at the ceremonies in Dundalk and then we are told that there are no Garda resources for anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I submit that we need an all-Ireland police force, but not in this form of juxtaposition between two separate police forces. More important, we need a police force that is accountable to the people and the political system and we need a police force that will attract members to it from places like Ballsmills in south Armagh, Ballymurphy and the Bogside. We do not have that type of force at present. It is claimed that more Catholics are joining the PSNI than ever before. The Catholics who are joining the police force come from the same background as those who always joined the RUC, namely, those from middle class areas such as Newtownards and, Bangor. The latter could be described as the safe areas. It is not representative of the entire Catholic community at present and people should not pretend that it is so.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Many speakers referred to Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. Pat Finucane was my solicitor at one time and there is probably no doubt that he had an excellent legal mind and that is probably one of the reasons the RUC special branch, together with British intelligence, colluded with their Unionist terror gangs to have him murdered. Where are the people who organised that murder? Many of us believe that they are still in the very same special branch. Those people will be diluted a little by sending a few gardaí down to sit beside them or to police alongside them. I am sure Members will understand if I remain to be convinced on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I wish to refer to the case of Nora McCabe, a woman in her late 50s who left her house one day to buy a pint of milk in the shop. An RUC officer called Jimmy Crutchley, fired a plastic bullet at her and, unfortunately, poor Nora did not get her milk. The claim that Catholics from across the North will join this force is wide of the mark. That is one of the core issues that must be addressed if we are to achieve what we want. I do not believe this Bill will be of any assistance in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Where is the accountability of the policing boards to the community that they are supposed to represent? It is not in place yet. At present, the British Army GOC, the chief officer of the RUC and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, are the three people who call the shots – perhaps that is an unfortunate pun in this instance – in terms of the current policing force. That is not Patten, nor is it anywhere near Patten. I accept that during the course of the recent negotiations, significant progress was made on the Patten framework in terms of progressing matters close to a position where republicans could accept the PSNI as a community policing service. Unfortunately, because of the shenanigans that went on around the elections and the negotiation, it fell apart and did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I accept that there is a need for a police service and I believe republicans and Nationalists in the North accept it because nobody wants a decent police force more than them. Young people on the streets of the North do not enjoy that at present. The alternative is punishment beatings, which are brutal and barbaric. I have condemned this practice before and not just in some token manner to cover myself politically. It is a terrible practice and it needs to end. I wonder if we are realistic in expecting communities not to try to police themselves when we are not putting a proper police service in place and there is certainly no sign of that happening at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">It has been said during this debate that there are a few bad apples everywhere. The people who talk about a few bad apples should read that little part of the Stevens report that was published. Stevens, a British police officer, who came to the North after a few others like him – these people were done in by the special branch in one of their usual dirty tricks-type operations – found evidence that the RUC had been working hand in glove with Unionist paramilitary organisations and that, together with military intelligence, they had helped not just to reorganise but to arm them. Weapons were brought in from South Africa. It is important to point out that these were not supplied by the current regime in that country but by the white regime that was previously in power. The gangs to which I refer were armed, given the relevant files and given assistance in setting up Nationalists such as Pat Finucane and a host of others to be murdered. The people to whom I refer are still in place in the PSNI and the Bill does not foresee that they will be removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">What is the position with the other half of the Stevens report that was not published? It must have been so bad that they could not publish it. Part of the reason for this is that the material it contains will lead into Downing Street itself. That is most unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Some speakers have stated that it is a sign of democracy to have a good police service. I ask these people to reflect for a moment on the history of democracy in terms of British occupied Ireland. The first example was in 1918 when Sinn Féin won the general election and Britain refused to recognise it. There are more recent examples when Bobby Sands was elected in Fermanagh-South Tyrone and the first thing Maggie Thatcher did was to outlaw prisoners standing for election. That did not work because Owen Carron, his election agent got elected also. This is happening again in the North where Tony Blair, a British Prime Minister, came over and told the Irish people, who voted for it in the Good Friday Agreement, that they cannot have elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I understood the Government and the Taoiseach were equal partners in the Good Friday Agreement. I often try to imagine what happened. How did the Taoiseach approach the subject with Tony Blair? Did he go at him forcefully saying we must have an election, we are insisting on it and we are not allowing you to say "no"? I do not imagine it happened in that way. Perhaps I am exaggerating. I look forward to clarification from the Taoiseach at some stage because, after all, he represents the entire people of the island on that issue. I can imagine the meeting at the beginning where a cup of tea was brought in, they were sitting down and perhaps there was a chat about the weather or the Taoiseach's journey to London. Perhaps the Taoiseach asked, "Why not get the bainne?", or, "Would you like a drop of milk, Prime Minister? By the way I am against your election, would you like some sugar?"  That is the weight of representation a significant number of people along the Border area where I come from think was made. I would like to hear from the Taoiseach what level of representation he made to the British Government on behalf of all the people of Ireland on that issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_204">It is the political situation which has the policing issue where it is and it needs to be addressed. It is in that context I am speaking. We heard talk during this debate about whether Britain is still at war in Ireland. That is relevant to the Bill because the British have not said they are not still at war in Ireland. Who said it and when, has come up already, and rightly so, and needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The collusion between the Garda and RUC has been taking place for a considerable time. It has been dressed up and they have tried to put frilly curtains on it sometimes by making it into a little golf classic or a little golf outing in some part of the deep south or the Antrim coast. There is this working out at political level to try to encourage these officers at ground level to co-operate. However, the point is being missed because there is no sign of the police service itself changing. Patten represented some steps that would have facilitated some change but, unfortunately, that never came to pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We heard about normality in the North, the fact that it is considerably more normal now, shortcuts across the Border, and so on. I do not see normality from the window of my house. I see British army look-out posts still in place. A couple of posts are being dismantled. One is on the Armagh hills, which has been unoccupied for more than six months. It was in a dilapidated condition. It was as well to take it down, otherwise it would have fallen down. This is happening at a time when the post on Faughill Mountain, overlooking the main crossing at Carrickcarnon, is being extended and developed, and we are being told the situation is normal. The situation is far from normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I want to refer to how to make a bigger connection between people in the North and not just people in the South, but the institutions here. That has been neglected by the political establishment. I do not mean just the current one or the one before it, I mean continually since partition. The political establishment in this State could have developed all-Ireland services. Certainly it could have facilitated postal voting rights for citizens in the North, particularly during presidential elections, and perhaps other elections. It could have provided a number of seats here. The issue of northern representation in this Parliament has been discussed on several occasions but there is no movement on it. Why? The continued institutionalising of partition by the political establishment in this State is, to say the least, unfortunate. Now there is an opportunity to end it, and it should be ended. That is not an offence to anyone. We hear from the major Government party that it is a republican party. It is fine to say these things but surely there is an obligation to demonstrate occasionally that there is a bit of republicanism there. I am not doubting the credentials of individuals within that party. Like any party, I know it includes sound, able and honourable republicans. However, I would like to see the party doing something to demonstrate that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I recall hearing that parties should behave like ordinary political parties. I would like to behave like an ordinary political party. In order to do so, I wonder should I contact former Members of the House such as Charles J. Haughey or Ray Burke to see if they could give me some grinds on how to achieve this noble status of an ordinary party. Perhaps the Deputy who said that will contact me privately to give me some advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">As I have just one minute remaining I will come back to the core of the matter, namely, whether the time is now right for the introduction of the Bill. I say it is not. This Bill will be welcome when the last few centimetres of difficulty in the North are sorted out. I will happily be a sponsor of the Bill at that stage. It is premature and people should not fit easily into their party political mode and hang the people in the North out to dry. It is crucial that Deputies assume their responsibility by examining this issue in their own right and stand up for the people who need to be defended at this stage. That will be more productive in terms of the entire peace process than supporting the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_214">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill. I welcome the Bill which seeks to implement the policing principles of the Good Friday Agreement. We have all seen the developments that have taken place in Northern Ireland in the past seven or eight years. Those of us who were deeply conscious in our young days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland always thought we would not see the current level of peace in our lifetime. This is a further step in developing that process. I appreciate that some people have difficulties in this regard. It is understandable because there was little confidence in the old RUC by large sections of the northern community. It is difficult in a short time to fully accept that there could be such a vast change. It will take time. Given proper leadership by the police authorities in Northern Ireland and the Garda authorities in the South, I hope that confidence will grow. The police force has a challenge to ensure it is accepted by all sections of the community in the North and that it attracts members from all areas of Northern Ireland. I congratulate the Nationalist community on embracing and joining the new police force. It is most important for the success of the police force that members of the Nationalist community join it and make it work.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The content of the Bill arises from the Patten report, which was a most important element in developing acceptance of the police force. It also developed co-operation between North and South. That co-operation had taken place in different ways over the years. The Chief Constable of the RUC met the Garda Commissioner over the years to discuss policing matters. Under the Bill, members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland over the rank of inspector can be transferred to the Garda Síochána and gardaí can be seconded to the PSNI for up to three years. That offers the opportunity to members of both forces to obtain experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I wish to pay tribute to the Garda Síochána on its activities abroad. People do not realise its level of activity in developing countries and, under the United Nations, in flashpoint areas. I visited Namibia on several occasions in the early 1990s when members of the Garda Síochána from Templemore were training the Namibian police force. The Minister for Justice of the day complimented the Garda Síochána on its input into the development of the Namibian police force. The Garda will now have another opportunity to obtain experience and to bring credibility to the Police Force of Northern Ireland by involving itself in the policing of Northern Ireland. That is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I welcome the new police body and congratulate the official Unionists, the SDLP and others on their involvement in it. I hope that, in a short period, all parties in Northern Ireland will obtain enough confidence in the force to become involved in the police body. That is a challenge. It is easy to say that all parties in Northern Ireland should join the police body, but that body must, at the same time, gain the confidence of all the parties so that they will have sufficient confidence to join it. It is a two-way process.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The media and politicians tend to condemn republicans in Northern Ireland for their activities, but we often condemn all republicans rather than the activities of certain republicans. We should make that clear differentiation because republicanism is sometimes tarnished by some of the activities that happened in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The Minister is aware of the problems in Limerick and this is not the time to debate them. However, what is the up to date position regarding the bringing to justice of those who killed Brian Fitzgerald in Limerick? People who are familiar with the situation are extremely concerned about those involved in that dastardly murder. My children go to that nightclub and Brian Fitzgerald was protecting them from being harassed by people peddling drugs. It cost him his life. We are most interested in that murder case being solved. I have previously asked this question of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and he has given me assurances. I am not playing politics with this issue. We want all the murder cases in Limerick solved, but this was a dastardly murder and whoever perpetrated it should not be allowed to get away with it. The full force of the law should be applied to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Policing the Border counties exacted a heavy toll on Garda resources during the second half of the 20th century. In more recent times, however, the reduction in violence across Northern Ireland, following the various initiatives to which I referred and moves to increase North-South policing co-operation, have made it easier to uphold the law in what, historically, has been one of the most volatile regions in Europe, particularly during the Troubles. In April last year the international agreement designed to improve cross-Border investigations was signed and facilitated personnel movement between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána. It was an initiative designed to improve Border policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">A number of co-operative schemes had already been put in place prior to that and in March last year the Garda and the PSNI formalised their training links. Officers from both services are involved on a regular basis in delivering training to students in each other's organisations. Three gardaí began teaching at the PSNI college at Garnerville last year. They delivered a series of classes on traffic, crime and general policing duties. Also in April of last year, PSNI trainees travelled to the Garda college at Templemore for a reciprocal visit. These were the first of many exchanges which are planned over the coming years and which were set up on foot of the Patten report. Recommendation 161 of that report states that there should be structured co-operation between the police services in terms of training. There had been informal links in the past, but this co-operation is now on a more formalised basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">What impact has this co-operation and the overall improvement in the security situation north of the Border following the various paramilitary ceasefires had on day to day policing activities? There is no doubt that the job of the gardaí on the Border has become easier and more pleasant than it has been at any time during the past 40 years. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the situation was extremely tense. There were numerous instances of shots being fired across the Border. The reduction in paramilitary violence has made the relationship between the Garda and the PSNI more relaxed.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Tension was always created by groups trying to re-open smaller, cross-Border roads that had been closed by the security forces at the height of the Troubles. There were frequent exchanges between those trying to re-open the roads and those who had been instructed to close them. Now that the security situation has improved, these roads have been opened and this removes a potential point of conflict. However, opening the roads has created a new situation. While the threat of violence has subsided dramatically, overall crime in the Border area has increased. The irony is that criminals are now using the same roads that were closed for security reasons for criminal activity. With the checkpoints removed, it is easier for people to move back and forth across the Border and this has encouraged criminals on both sides to commit crimes ranging from opportunistic low level theft to more serious crimes involving violence in both jurisdictions. One of the few exceptions to the pattern of increasing criminal activity came during the foot and mouth crisis, when movement across the Border was being more closely monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Working relationships now exist at all levels of both forces and the provide an effective weapon in the fight against crime. If a vehicle is stolen in Newry and is seen heading for the Border, it is much easier to intercept it if local gardaí are made aware of its movements at the earliest possible opportunity. Improvements in communication technology have also played their part in improving cross-Border liaison. There have been many examples of criminal activity starting on one side of the Border and continuing on the other. The monitoring process is the same as that relating to a crime taking place exclusively in either jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The benefits to the gardaí of improved cross-Border co-operation and a reduction in paramilitary activity extend beyond the professional. While there is widespread relief that the normal working day in the Border region is more akin to that of a garda in any other part of the State, life outside work has also become less stressful. The latter is a welcome development. We must pay tribute to those gardaí who served for many years on the Border in stressful situations. My brother served for 12 months on the Border so I am aware of the activity involved in the 1970s, when there was a high level of difficulty in policing the area. We should remember that and congratulate gardaí for the work they did and continue to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">We are discussing co-operation between North and South, but we should also examine co-operation between police forces throughout Europe. I have lost touch with the Schengen experiment into intra-state co-operation in combating drug trafficking and other international criminal activity but there is an urgent need to develop co-operation between police forces across Europe. A unique situation exists in this country, but legislation of this nature should be more typical within the European Union to deal with drug and child trafficking and other international crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The gardaí are extremely concerned about the withdrawal of support and resources for them to do their duty in policing the State. The force's view of what is happening is illustrated by an article in the Garda Review:</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Government have now decided, without exception, that every Department will operate with a budgetary constraint. They have quickly forgotten that when the Garda Síochána are given the resources and facilities to deal with serious issues of crime that we have shown tremendous success. The Irish people cannot be taken for granted. They are now going to be left in a society that will become increasingly lawless. The relentless news coverage of gratuitous killings and gangland war is a good indicator of the current climate. Whatever else happens in this country, we cannot allow gangland bosses to take back territory gained, not when so much has been done to ensure that they do not carry out crime without sanction.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Rank and file members are expressing real fear for the community as well as themselves. They see a scarcity of Guards to assist them when dealing with Public Order issues. This issue of resources and the unavailability of personnel will not go away. The Government, and the Minister, is ultimately responsible. We in the Garda Síochána will have to advise the public we serve of the great difficulties and the problems we are encountering as a result of these drastic cut backs. If we do anything less than that, we would be totally dishonest.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Unfortunately, it is the rank and file members in the cities, towns and villages throughout this country who continue to get the calls for assistance and we cannot respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">It is a matter of extreme concern that gardaí see the situation in that light, both from their point of view and from that of members of the public who are living in fear. Those of us who walk the streets at night feel a totally different atmosphere from that of ten years ago. When I first came to Dublin, I had no problem with walking anywhere in this town. There were incidents at the time, but they were not as glaring or as frequent as they are at present. There was not the same sense of fear that we feel now. It was stated recently that O'Connell Street in Dublin is the most dangerous street in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">I welcome the Bill, look forward to its operation and to seeing PSNI members on the streets of Dublin and the gardaí on the streets of Belfast. We hope that the policing bodies work towards and obtain the confidence of all people in Northern Ireland and the concerns of Deputy Morgan and certain sections of the community there about joining the police force are addressed at an early stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_238">There is something sad about the idea that police co-operation must be formalised through legal mechanisms. Co-operation between police forces should be a natural practice and it is a symbol of the unusual circumstances in this country that, through the means of political negotiations, we come to this Bill in the hope that it will produce a more normal society in Northern Ireland. On that, at least, the House is in agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">It could also be argued that this Bill helps to formalise the degree of co-operation that already exists. Even at the height of the political violence that has marred this island, particularly Northern Ireland, there was always a degree of co-operation that helped to prevent the murder and mayhem spiralling even further out of control. That should be noted because it was mistrust that often exacerbated the situation. There is a case for statutory mechanisms to help us move as far away from that situation as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">It is out hope that, through a speedy resolution that brings about a normal situation in Northern Ireland, a better society will exist throughout the island. This Bill incorporates into our legislation recommendations of the Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland and how that affects policing in the Republic, which are welcome on several levels. I have the good fortune to be one of my party's representatives on the National Forum on Europe which is excellently chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes. The House should recognise his contribution to that forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The criticism has been made that in seeking to bring about a more normal police force in Northern Ireland, many of the principles underlying the Patten report could be applied here. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will argue that in the legislation he wants to bring before this House, some of which we have seen, he is aiming to do that. However, this is not treating like with like in that the changes already effected in Northern Ireland would go only some way to change and reform the Garda Síochána but not as far as many of us would like. The Garda Síochána has served our society well. Despite worries about recent trends in the type of, and increase in, crime, historically, and in comparison with other countries, we have low levels of crime. The main reason for that has to be the effectiveness of the gardaí and support for them. There have been occasions, however, and they seem to have been more regular in recent times, when the lack of proper structures for complaints against gardaí and for policing them has induced a great deal of discomfort, not only within our political system but in society at large. The Green Party would like to see the spirit of the Patten report expressed in the changes the Minister envisages in other legislation covering the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">There are many things to welcome in this Bill. Other speakers, and those who have a particular connection with Northern Ireland, have talked about the continuing lack of support for the police there, despite the many changes that have been made in the name and structure of the force. Even small things can have great importance, such as the formation of a Gaelic football team by the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">My party finds it hard to accept the argument that because the changes in the PSNI have not been as far reaching as many would have liked, or as fast as they should have been, we should avoid engaging in a proper, supported community police force in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement also included measures such as the release of prisoners and no prosecution for indicted crimes of a political nature. In light of that, it seems right that regarding the past activities of the police force in Northern Ireland, we should acknowledge that we have to move on as one society on this island. I do not recommend the approach that many seem to suggest that we remember no evil. The Green Party has advocated the South African approach of a truth and reconciliation commission. It is important that we recognise what has happened and how and why it has happened. Then we can move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">On the question of bringing about greater community support for policing in Northern Ireland, this Bill's provisions for lateral entry by members of the Garda Síochána into the PSNI, and <i>vice versa,</i> is welcome. Short of the full co-operation, support and trust of people in one community in Northern Ireland for the PSNI, it is a mechanism that will help increase the number of people whose attitude is at least supportive and understanding of that community. It would help to speed the day when there is a police service of that type in Northern Ireland. If we do not work to achieve that as fast as possible within the existing political structures, such as the police authority, we will leave a vacuum to be exploited by those who use the term “community policing” to refer to policing with the hurley or baseball bat or kneecapping. It is not in the interest of anyone in public life on this island to support the continuation of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I have reservations about trying to induce and produce this type of co-operation between police forces on the island. We need to consider how that can be done in a more effective way. Other contributors to this debate have talked about the desire for a single police force on the island. While there are arguments for police co-operation there are also arguments for police co-ordination. In regard to the future of policing here, even though this is a small country with a relatively small population, the concept of a national police force covering every aspect of policing does not exist elsewhere. It does not exist, for example, in the United States or in the United Kingdom. Instead of having a bi-polar relationship between the two major police forces here maybe we should be considering a decentralised police service in the North and in the Republic. That would help wider co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">If we want to effect better co-ordination between the two police services we need to compare like with like. The number of members of the PSNI has been reduced but it is still heavily manned in comparison with other normal police forces in Europe. We need to help bring about not only the quality of police service that is trusted by the community in Northern Ireland but also one that is proportionate to the needs of a normal society.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The other aspect of the lateral entry that I found interesting, and I am sorry that the Minister has had to leave the Chamber, refers to people over the rank of inspector being allowed into the appropriate forces. One place where this does not happen, and where the PSNI has an advantage over the Garda Síochána, is at the highest level. The Chief Constable of the PSNI is selected after open interview. The Commissioner of our police force is a political appointee. One of the reforms we need to bring about in our system of selecting police is to put people through the same system of selection that police forces throughout the world undergo. This could be done through an examination by the appropriate Oireachtas committee so that a successful candidate could say what his or her priorities were in regard to policing here and for co-operation between this police force and the PSNI. Given that the Minister is looking for a new idea every day I am quite prepared to give him that one for nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In general terms my party supports this Bill even though we are saddened that there is still a need for this type of co-operation to be brought about in this way. We would also be supportive of the Government's approach to dealing with Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">This Bill, which is clear, has a set purpose and will achieve defined ends has to be contrasted with the Bill that went through the House of Commons this week regarding the postponement of the elections in Northern Ireland. It was a vague Bill which mentioned no alternative date and was not clear on the political principles underlying the postponement. On those grounds we could argue that the sense of the British Government in the peace process is something less than we might have hoped for. For that reason, my party supports the Bill and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and we will be happy to play any role we can, either in this House or through our sister party in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_250">Ba mhaith liom glacadh leis an deis labhairt ar an Bhille seo, mar ceapaim go bhfuil sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbéimis ag féachaint agus ag díriú ar na nithe dearfacha atá ag tarlú ar an oileán seo seachas bheith ag díriú ar na rudaí diúltacha i gcónaí. Recently there has been a tendency to dwell on the difficulties still present in the process on this island, but it is important that we look at positive developments such as the introduction of this timely piece of legislation which is an indication of the progress being made on cross-Border co-operation and the key issues of policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I speak of progress because, undoubtedly, policing in Northern Ireland has changed more in the past 18 months than in the previous 80 years. We have witnessed the establishment of a new police service, with a new name, badge and flag, as well as a new policing board to hold it to account. These have truly been times of change in an area where contentious issues had always been the norm. Now we can see great advances and more need to be made. This Bill is a contribution to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The Bill deals primarily with the conditions governing both the permanent appointment and the secondment of members of the PSNI to the Garda Síochána and <i>vice versa.</i> As we know, it has its foundation in the agreement between the Irish and British Governments on police co-operation of 29 April 2002. The Bill forges a formal link between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI, allowing what I believe are landmark advances in co-operation and mobility between North and South at police level. It is important to say that the link is a formal one as there has been great co-operation over the years. Only a few months ago, I attended a co-operative conference involving people from the North, the South and the FBI as the nature of policing, crime and detection is so world-wide. The Bill is significant because it puts matters on the formal footing needed in the context of this country's political situation. This co-operation is not new and we can build on the collaborative environment which exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">In accordance with the intergovernmental agreement, the Bill allows PSNI members to be eligible to apply for permanent posts not below the rank of superintendent in the Garda Síochána and <i>vice versa.</i> As has been highlighted here already, the selection procedures will be merit-based. People could then be seconded to positions in the Garda Síochána not above the rank of inspector for up to three years. The same is true of gardaí who wish to spend a period in the PSNI. This is valuable because one will then get people with good experience. All secondees will have the powers, duties, rights and obligations of existing members of identical rank.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The provision is particularly welcome because it will present a great many career opportunities for members of the forces, including permanent and temporary positions across the Border. There will also be opportunities for the respective police forces to which members originally belonged, since they will obviously be bringing back experience from alternative surroundings, something I recently witnessed in the Garda Jerry McCabe scholarships in New York at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Irish gardaí on secondment are trained there and students of the college are sent over here. This type of co-operation is very valuable. With increased co-operation and training, society benefits. The experience, time, effort and commitment which those people have invested mean that the various elements of crime can be tackled much more positively and efficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">We know that the British Government will be putting in place the necessary arrangements for the Garda Síochána and it will be a valuable experience for them. Importantly, service with the PSNI will also continue to be regarded as service with the Garda Síochána for pension, promotion and seniority purposes. If one wishes to entice people, one must ensure there are benefits, rather than disincentives, for them. This new arrangement is important for what it can do for co-operation and society, but also in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report and will be a very effective way of moving forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">We are making very exciting advances regarding policing and our understanding of society, central to which is the facilitation not only of police co-operation North and South but also – and especially – of a greater degree of trust between communities. That must be at the foundation of any police force and the thinking behind this legislation. I look forward to what I hope will be a good level of uptake from both police forces. They have much to offer each other, including new perspectives, ideas, methods and suggestions. It will be very challenging, but I am sure we will see real results on the effects of drugs, organised crime, gang warfare and the various elements we have witnessed in recent years, particularly cross-Border co-operation after horrific terrorist attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">This Bill comes at a time of ongoing transformation in the North. The Patten recommendations continue to be implemented across a range of areas. Major strides have been made by the police board, with new initiatives and innovative strategies which are having a real impact. We have seen a ten year human resources strategy, a recently launched code of ethics based on the highest standards of conduct and practice, the recruitment of 1,500 new part-time police officers to establish bonds with neighbourhoods and the launch of the district policing partnerships which considerably strengthen local police accountability across Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I hope that allowing gardaí to join the PSNI, either permanently or on secondment, will encourage younger members, in particular, of the North's Catholic community to respect and trust their local police force. We have been very fortunate in this country that as a society we have always had great respect for and faith in the Garda Síochána, something I hope is not being eroded. I hope that such trust can also seep into society in Northern Ireland. With the prohibitive traditional structures that might have existed in the past, that trust was lacking, but now there is a great new opportunity. It is central to the operation of the Good Friday Agreement and recognises that a police service must be representative, accountable and acceptable, working for the whole community.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The success of the Agreement, which aims to deliver peace, stability and reconciliation, has been constantly challenged and is dependent to a significant degree on the success of the police force. I hope that this legislation will be a major contributor to the ongoing success of the Good Friday Agreement and enable us to meet the continual challenges with which it presents us, coming at a time of significant change. We are now putting on a formal footing the co-operation of recent years. I believe that this can have very positive effects, not just on the police forces North and South but, more particularly, on the societies and communities they represent.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important Bill. I note that, despite what may have been thought from some of the contributions, there is unanimity on the Bill as Deputy Morgan stated that he would be happy to sponsor it himself if the timing were right. The only issue we are left with is whether the timing is right for this Bill as queried by Sinn Féin Deputies and Deputy Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">There is no point in rehearsing what has already been said about the merits of the Bill. This is an outworking of the Patten process which itself is an outworking of the Good Friday Agreement. All parties in this House, of which I am aware, are committed to the Good Friday Agreement and although Sinn Féin did not accept the Patten report at the outset, it became insistent in recent times that it should be implemented in its every letter, comma and every full stop. That was a welcome movement on its part. Now its says it is not the right time to go ahead with implementing one portion of the report on North-South secondments, transfers and the like.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I wonder what it is about this particular time that makes it inopportune to proceed with this legislative basis for co-operation. I apprehend that the basis of the Sinn Féin opposition to the Bill being passed at this stage is that it feels something is about to happen in a short period of time which will make it more opportune, fairly soon, to pass this legislation. I ask myself what could happen suddenly in the next few months which would make it more opportune to pass this Bill then rather than now.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_266">For my part, I echo the point made by Deputy Durkan that, of course, there are imperfections in every police force and in every institution on these islands and, doubtless, everywhere else in the world. However, no amount of alleged imperfections justifies saying now is not the time to work on remedying them. The Sinn Féin position in this House and in this debate is that somehow by deferring action in relation to co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána, we will hasten the day that the imperfections to which it points will be remedied and addressed. I happen to believe the opposite proposition, namely, that whatever problems there are or may be with our police force here in this State or with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, north of the Border, they are much more likely to be addressed in an atmosphere and a context of close co-operation between the two parts of these islands rather than in a context of suspended animation pending the approach, to some degree, of the perfection stipulated by people in the background of the republican movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I welcome the statement by Deputy Morgan that he believes in the establishment of and the necessity for a police service. I welcome wholeheartedly and without equivocation, or in any way being cynical about it, his condemnation of punishment beatings. It is a welcome and sincere statement on his part that he repudiates what goes on very frequently in the back lanes of Crossmaglen, west Belfast and in other places in Northern Ireland and on the other side of the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland where people are brutalised regularly by people within their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The phrase "punishment beatings" is used but I have always regarded that phrase as a particularly unfortunate media euphemism. In my view, what one is talking about is mutilation torture in most cases. Peoples' ankles are being broken, their joints are being permanently destroyed and bullets are being fired into their joints with a view to crippling them for life. This mutilation torture that is carried on by people who wear balaclavas and wield baseball bats, while their friends hold a pistol to frighten the people into submission to this torture, is inhumane and is a total breach of human rights. When we hear the rhetoric of human rights and the deep concern expressed from some quarters in this House in regard to human rights issues, I always ask that those people unequivocally and at every opportunity challenge those closer to them when it appears that ordinary 16 and 17 year olds, who have fallen into delinquency in their areas, are taken out, tortured and mutilated in the name of the Irish Republic and in the name of people who claim to exercise its authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The word "republicanism" has been bandied about a little during this debate. Without attempting to define "republicanism" in the few short minutes available to me, I will say this – those who support this Bill and its early implementation, have more republicanism in the nail of their little finger than those who put on balaclavas and wield baseball bats and take out 16 and 17 year olds and mutilate them for the rest of their lives and pray in aid the absence of a police force with which they themselves refuse to engage. That is one of the great conundrums.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">When speaking about republicanism we should, I think, remember that our tricolour has three colours. Republicanism is a noble philosophy to which I subscribe. It is a philosophy which is descended from Tone, Davis and Pearse. I often think that those who wipe their baseball bats clean in Crossmaglen and west Belfast—</p>

          <p eId="para_272">—having damaged young children in those circumstances might remember the words we looked at on the wall in Arbour Hill the other day about not bringing dishonour upon their weapons – words from the Proclamation of 1916 about which we heard in the course of this debate. Sometimes the language we use in this House is debased beyond belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I recall on one occasion joining a peace march in Dublin after some particular atrocity in Northern Ireland. Out of one of the side streets on to O'Connell Street came a group of Sinn Féin supporters carrying pro-peace process banners. Two of them were carrying hastily-put-together banners commemorating the unfortunate death of a young republican on a bus in London when a bomb he was carrying blew up. The banners they held on that occasion in that peace parade into which they had intruded bore the words "Remember volunteer Ed O'Brien, Irish peace activist". At some stage, language ceases to have meaning. In the course of this debate there have been a few occasions when I felt we were very close to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The process of outworking the Good Friday Agreement is at hand. The two Governments, whatever their differences – and they are significant differences in relation to the postponement of the elections in Northern Ireland – remain united in their determination to put into effect as much of the joint declaration as can possibly be done regardless of the political impasse that has arisen. Now is not the time for us to put matters into neutral or to take the keys out of the motor of progress in Northern politics. Now is not the time for us to withhold our goodwill from the outworkings of the Good Friday Agreement. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to show that democratic politics work and that reconciliation is not merely an entitlement but something likely to be delivered to the riven society in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Since every speaker in the House has supported the principle of co-operation in policing on this island, the only issue is that of timing. When carefully addressed and analysed, the timing issue is one on which the great majority of Members are of one mind. Now is the time to go forward with these measures; it is not the time to stall the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I look forward to the day, in the not so distant future, when all the political parties represented in Northern Ireland's institutions will find their way to participate in the police board of Northern Ireland. I look forward to a time when the powers of government regarding policing matters in Northern Ireland are devolved to the maximum extent to the Northern Ireland Assembly, established under the Good Friday Agreement. I look forward to the establishment of ministries in Northern Ireland to cover the area of justice and home affairs. I also look forward to cross community agreement with regard to how political accountability can be put in place in the policing of Northern Ireland. I further look forward to the early resolution of all these matters. The interests of Ireland and all the people of this island, whatever their political outlook, would be best served if we get on with the task of producing a seamless blanket of security on this island so that nobody is threatened or has their life put in issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">The House will have the opportunity of considering further the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage. On the basis of the debate we have had so far, unless there are technical amendments to be made to the Bill, it should have a speedy passage through the House. I hope it will have passed through the Houses and become law before the summer recess in order that the important business of consulting members of the police services, North and South, on the implementation of the legislation, which requires their voluntary co-operation, can be carried out. This will enhance the prospect of police patrols in Crossmaglen, west Belfast, Derry and other places in Northern Ireland having among their number seconded members of the Garda Síochána, and it will enable similar measures to be implemented south of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">In the past fortnight, an attempt was made by so-called dissident republicans to murder two members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland by throwing a coffee-jar bomb at their patrol car. The victims of this kind of violence deserve our protection and solidarity.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_379">I welcome this Bill. It puts into a legislative framework existing principles that have been implemented by various Ministers in various Governments over the past four decades since the Criminal Justice Act 1960. Maybe this Bill was spurred on by two particular cases – a court case and a Supreme Court decision on the Finn case. In the latter case, the <i>obiter dictum</i> was primarily to give a message – if I may use that term – to the Legislature to set out definitive and clear terms with regard to the criteria for the early release of prisoners. This does not give the Minister of the day any particular additional powers but it makes matters more transparent from a legislative point of view. Also, it puts into a proper perspective what various Ministers have been doing in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">It is important that we get the balance right when it comes to the release and temporary release of prisoners. There is an overriding duty to protect society and there is also a duty to protect those consigned to prison having been convicted of serious crimes. Having paid their debt to society, they are presented with the carrot of early parole or early release.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1960, there were certain crimes such as sex offences, serious drugs offences and serial murder regarding which the Minister was restricted or prohibited from considering early release and parole. The court decision changed that and the Minister cannot cherry-pick what types of cases can be dealt with under parole or early release criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">As spokesperson on justice and as a member of various committees during my term in the Seanad, I considered the notion of prison reform in respect of prisoners who might be recurrent drug abusers, alcoholics, or those who have, from time to time, psychological or psychiatric problems. As I understand the law, whether applied by a District Court or High Court judge, the duty of a judge is to sentence a person, when convicted, to a term of incarceration in a particular prison, if appropriate. It is a flaw that the judges are unable to decide that those who abuse alcohol or drugs or who were abused as children might need psychiatric treatment or the assessment of a clinical psychologist. The lack of therapists has been a drawback in our system and the Minister should take this on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">At some stage in the past two or three years I found out that there were between 280 to 300 prisoners in Cork prison and one clinical psychologist assigned to them. This is unfortunate. I know we spend a lot of money and the cost of keeping prisoners in jail is frightening. We have a particularly good prison system and most of our prisons are as good as one will find anywhere, if not better than those in any part of the developed world, be it in Europe or America. We should provide more therapists, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and introduce programmes for prisoners in need of treatment, such as those with recurrent drug problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Consider the principle of double incarceration. Many prisoners, for whatever reason, are imprisoned within their own minds. It is a known fact that, for some, treatment can be effective and therapy and counselling can be of huge benefit. If the prisoners come out of prison, on early release or otherwise, without having received the treatment they deserve, they will be totally unprepared to go back into society. This area deserves more attention. The ratio of clinical psychologists, counsellors and therapists to prisoners should be about 20:1. This area deserves to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It is sad that recurring groups of people engage in criminal activity. The Bugsy Malone gang of the 1960s has been replicated by later generations of gangs who have become involved in violence, drugs and other forms of crime. The result is an unfortunate and continuous cycle of criminal activity. The current generation of young criminals are much better educated, and are far more violent and vicious. They have no respect for law and order, the Garda, society or their peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">In the last decade alcohol abuse has contributed greatly to crime while the closer relationship between the prison population and drug abuse is frightening. I commend the Minister and other members of the Cabinet for looking at the whole question of alcohol abuse, especially among the young. I have a young family and when I attend functions it is frightening to see the numbers who frequent places where alcohol is served. When I was young it was acceptable to have a pint or two, but nowadays among the young it is a question of how quickly they can get drink into them. The Government is committed to addressing this issue. If we are not serious about it the country will face a major health crisis in ten or 15 years. The health implications of what is happening are already frightening and matters are deteriorating.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">When I was a teenager we had little or no money and we considered ourselves rich if we went out with £1 in our pocket. However, today young people in their early 20s or late teens and even younger depart with €50 and €100 notes when buying drink and do not care about the change so long as they get the drinks they ordered, be it a double, a shot, a Bacardi Breezer or whatever alcopop they drink. It is a frightening development.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">There is much talk about prison reform, the cost of overtime for prison officers and law and order on the streets. If we are honest we must admit that the young generation has a problem with alcohol abuse. We must be serious about tackling it. If not, the problems will accelerate, especially with the accident and emergency rooms in hospitals. A nurse in Cork University Hospital told me that at weekends large numbers attend who are bleeding, bruised and battered from domestic and street violence as a result of drink-related incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The 1967 intoxicating liquor legislation contained a provision that licensed premises had to provide what was termed a "substantial meal" where they opened their doors for a number of hours to customers. As a solicitor, I recall applying to the District Court for exemptions to this provision. Its abolition was a bad decision. Some young teenagers and people in their early 20s move from pub to pub and then to a night-club that stays open until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. where they consume more drink and alcohol without having had the opportunity to avail of any meals.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Some night-clubs are cleaning up in terms of profits. One person told me they are a licence to print money. I do not wish to denigrate them for that; people must make money and earn a living. However, if they were obliged to provide a decent meal to their customers it would have the effect of slowing down the impact of alcohol and diminish the consequences we see only too often.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>)(i) of the proposed new section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, set out in section 2 of the Bill, provides that a person may be released from prison for a temporary period to assess the person's ability to reintegrate into society upon release. That is critical. A number of years ago an elderly lady in the west was viciously murdered by a prisoner who was on temporary release. While it is difficult to protect against that kind of situation, various professionals, such as psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists should have an involvement in assessing the suitability of prisoners for release. The Garda should also have an input, while the prison governor and others involved should report to the Minister to ensure that he or she can make an educated and proper assessment. It will not be possible to achieve the Utopian situation where every assessment is right, but if the Minister has the necessary reports to hand he or she will be able to make a more balanced and appropriate decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">There is the view in this country that a person convicted of murder should be sentenced to imprisonment for life. As I understand the law, a term of life imprisonment means the natural life of the prisoner. In some cases that can be a good thing, especially if a prisoner is unable to make retribution or cannot be rehabilitated and will, therefore, continue to pose a threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">However, some crimes are committed in the heat of the moment and those convicted are often sentenced to terms of imprisonment of ten or 15 years. In such circumstances many prisoners undergo courses and educate themselves. They often learn new skills, such as carpentry or metalwork. Some undergo a miraculous recovery and are sorry for their crime. There is a need to consider what can be done where it is clear that keeping them in prison beyond their term, at a significant cost to the State and the taxpayer, would be of little or no use. If it is assessed that they can be moved to an open prison or are capable of being reintegrated into society under scrutiny and subject to conditions, for example, the requirement to sign on at the local Garda station every day, and the Minister, prison and Garda authorities are satisfied that an early release would be appropriate, such a development would be good for society and the prisoners concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">During the term of the previous Government the death penalty for capital murder was abolished following a referendum, a development that did not receive much notice. By contrast, several of the more heavily populated states in the United State retain the death penalty, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Subsection (2) of the proposed new section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 sets out the factors the Minister must consider when deciding to grant temporary release. These are worthy of mention because they are explicit. In the view of the Supreme Court, the Legislature and the Government should set out clearly and transparently the criteria to be followed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Accordingly, the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates should be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The last Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced legislation to address serious drugs offences, which is a matter I spoke of at length in the Seanad. Through that legislation, a large majority of Oireachtas Members across the political divide agreed with the notion of minimum sentencing of ten years for serious drugs offences. Drugs offences are not only a national and cross-border issue, they are international. It disturbs me that the Legislature set out minimum sentences but – and I do not say this to be in any way derogatory to the Judiciary – in many instances since the enactment of the legislation, there was a failure to impose the mandatory ten-year sentence. We are elected and empowered to enact legislation, but we have passed a statute within which there is clear provision for a mandatory sentence of ten years. It is not good enough for certain judges to feel the sentence should be less in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Drugs are a serious and, unfortunately, growing menace to this society. For the drugs lords involved, drugs trafficking is a lucrative business and they should be taught a lesson. The Minister may refer to the matter in his contribution. It is inappropriate that someone who has been given a mandatory ten-year sentence should be eligible for early release for whatever reason. In my view, a mandatory sentence is mandatory. When a person is caught for drunk driving he or she is put off the road for two years and his or her licence is endorsed. Perhaps the Minister will clear up the query in my mind regarding mandatory sentencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I had a few more points to make, but I did not realise my 20 minutes would evaporate so quickly. I am glad to have been able to speak to this Bill, which I welcome. In case the view is abroad that its provisions are new, historic and ground breaking, I point out that they put into a statutory framework the practice of the last 40 years. Through this legislation that practice is tidied up, improved and made transparent to let judges and Ministers of the day know what the guidelines and criteria are.</p>

        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_399">It may not be related to this Bill, but I have a point to make regarding Deputy O'Donovan's reference to young people and alcohol. Deputy O'Donovan is not the only one to go on about young people when alcohol is debated in this House. It always happens, but the problem is not just with young people, it is across the board. Young people's alcohol problems are perhaps more evident as they are on the streets, but my experience of ten years work in a pub and in chippers informs me that many older people create violence indoors. They commit violence in the home, in restaurants and in pubs, not necessarily on the streets. I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will agree that it is unfair to refer only to young people. It is time we had a solid debate on alcohol abuse which concerns Departments across Government. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is leading the charge on his side and Deputy Deasy leads the charge on our side, but the issue goes further than the justice portfolio. I ask the Minister to consult with his colleagues to ensure that we have a proper debate in this House on alcohol abuse. The food which we used to get at discos was mentioned, but it was not of a great standard and it did not help. If we are going to go back to that provision, I hope good quality food will be recommended. What was offered before could leave one in a worse state. It might cause one problems the next day if not that night.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The legislation before the House is one of a long line of Bills presented by this Government for consideration which is not of a high priority. Some of the Bills which come before the House waste its time while others should be dealt with more quickly. The Railway Safety Bill 2001 has been hanging around for ages while the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill took up a whole week of the Dáil's business, though I am not sure it was relevant or important. I worry about time wasting. I may be going too far, but this Government is either on a mission of self-preservation or it is out of touch with what the country needs. The people on the ground ask why we do not discuss issues such as alcohol which I have just mentioned. They ask why we spend so much time speaking about things which are not overly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">While the Bill before the House has merit, as Deputy O'Donovan said, it serves only to clarify what is there already. The legislation is important as I would not like the Minister to be subjected to questions on the matters addressed in it, but Bills of this sort should be dealt with during what I call "off-peak times". I would not describe today as off-peak Dáil time as it replaces sitting days in June. Straightforward Bills to clarify existing practice with which everyone generally agrees should be dealt with on a Monday or a Friday or during a morning rather than during important time. It is often said that we in this House are out of touch and do not reflect what the people think. While this Bill has importance, in terms of what is happening outside this House, it is far from the top of the list of priorities of the people who put us here. The electorate pays our wages and expects us to address real problems. What have we done during this Dáil session to improve the lives of the men, women and children of this country? I cannot see the direct results. Will the streets be any safer because of our antics in this House? What do Joe and Mary Soap think, or have we asked them? They do not think what we do here is relevant which may be because of the way we sell ourselves. We have a chance to discuss that. Are we in this House to enact progressive and meaningful legislation or are we in an ivory tower? It is time Members on the Government benches took themselves to a dark corner to think about the promises they made during last year's election.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_403">Many guarantees were given and the Fianna Fáil slogan was, "A lot done, more to do". What has been done in the last year? The Government should take some time to think about it before asking its Ministers to introduce relevant and important legislation which might solve some of our problems. The Government should think about our real problems and decide to do something about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">At times, being in this House worries me. Its actions and those of the Government are frighteningly removed from the real world. The impression I and most people get is that we seem to be on another planet with an address at Dáil Éireann, Kildare Street, the Moon. Spending so much time on this and using up a day of Dáil time does not help. Is the Government so wrapped up in its own importance that it feels this legislation should take up valuable Dáil time? It should instead introduce legislation to reduce crime figures, put more gardaí on the beat and force criminals to pay through their noses and pockets for the crimes they commit and the hurt and pain they cause. We need legislation to release more money for the health service. Is it not more important for this House to tackle the youth drinking problem than to tweak an Act which has worked reasonably well since 1960 to suit some judge or Minister?</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Apart from a few on this side of the House, no one here can see that we are becoming irrelevant to people's lives. We cannot blame the people for that. They have lives to live on busy, dangerous streets and children to raise in an atmosphere of violence, drugs and alcohol. We cannot expect them to applaud us for saving the Minister from a potential law suit or for making his job easier. We might have got more support for this Bill if it included new ideas like the right of the Minister to empty our jails during the day to put convicts working on our roads or railways. Perhaps we could bring back the old chain gang, or a version of it. It could be considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">It costs approximately €1,000 per week to accommodate a prisoner. When an old person goes into a nursing home, their assets are evaluated and they are often told to rent out their house to pay for the cost. A person in prison costs hundreds if not thousands of euro per week. The logic does not make sense. These are simple questions which, perhaps, the Minister could address.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">Perhaps the Minister of State could list them so that we can discuss them in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">We might have had applause if the Minister said that not one person would get out from behind bars unless he was sure that they would not commit a crime again. However, there is no mention of a person who commits a crime against a minor serving statutory time, without regard to the circumstances. There is no mention of the fact that victims of crimes are the innocent injured parties. Victims' rights are not mentioned either, despite the fact that the National Economic and Social Forum, in the report on the reintegration of prisoners, recommended that the victims' charter should be implemented regarding notification of temporary release. The Bill could have made use of that, but it was not included.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Bill is irrelevant in many ways. Does the Minister see the revolving door returning? Is the Bill being introduced because rising crime figures mean that our prisons will be full again and that prisoners will have to be released in the daytime to allow others in? These are concerns and I hope the Minister will clarify the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, said that the Bill is not that important and is designed merely to put things in order. I wonder, therefore why we are here.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">If we were on the street, we would be the first in here banging on doors, complaining and writing letters. The Minister should do me and the people a favour by getting the Bill passed as quickly as possible so that we can turn our attention to the real issues that matter. For example, why do babies die in ambulances while being transferred from one hospital to another? Why are there between 5,000 and 10,000 people homeless? Why are our streets becoming no-go areas for people, young and old? Why is our penalty points system – which has clearly saved lives – now breaking at the seams and in danger of falling apart? Why inflation is out of control? Why have the elderly had their home help services severely cut?</p>
          <p eId="para_426">There are many ways in which we could raise money in the House, including selling advertising space on Government envelopes. It is a simple scheme which could raise a lot of money and we need to look at new ideas. We might not like to do it, but Deputies should consider all the envelopes that leave the House. The Minister of State can laugh all he likes, but I would go so far as to say that State cars will be next.</p>

We should be here debating the problems of the country. If I was running a business and I problems similar to those the country is experiencing, I would probably not go home until I had resolved them. I would keep at it, working longer and extra hours in order to try to find solutions. We do not do that; we seem to want to hide and take time off.

          <p eId="para_435">Why is the price of building land not being regulated by the House? The reason is that we are too busy discussing Bills, such as that before us, which are irrelevant. Perhaps Bills such as this suit the Government because they give it the excuse to do nothing while everyone else suffers from its lies and mismanagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Are the Government Deputies and Ministers men and women or mice? Are they just tired of being in Government? A rest would do them the world of good. Five or six years on, we are still getting the same old rhetoric. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has left the House, but I have listened to him defending his job for the past year and he keeps pulling out one Bill – the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill – as if it is going to solve all the problems. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill proposes to fine people €300 if they are barred from a pub and they go into it, but that will not scare someone who is drunk. It will not work. The Garda could close down a premises where trouble is occurring, but that measure will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">On each occasion the Minister is asked about his record, he refers to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, which the House took approximately 13 months to pass. How long will it take to pass the Bill before us? Probably another year. There was another Bill before the House earlier which the Minister said he hoped would be passed by the summer. I wish him luck because at the rate we work, that will not be the case, which is disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I hate to drift away from the substance of the Bill, but I wanted to take the opportunity to state my concerns about the House and how it works because there was not much to say about the Bill. There is a worrying point which I cannot figure out and which, perhaps, someone might explain to me. Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) states:</p>
          <p eId="para_439">. . . where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is necessary or expedient in order to–</p>
          <p eId="para_440">(i) ensure the good government of the prison concerned, or</p>
          <p eId="para_441">(ii) maintain good order in, and humane and just management of, the prison concerned,</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Is this a good reason to put a prisoner on temporary release?</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_444">It could be. It may have been raised already, but I cannot figure that matter out.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">There have been many recommendations from the forum in respect of the temporary release of prisoners. However, with regard to permanent releases, should we not ensure that a prisoner has a purpose in society – such as a job or a position in a voluntary group, in order to give him or her a role – before he or she is released? There are courses and retraining but, once people are released, the support structures are not always the best and people can fall through the net. If people do not have a role on their release, the chances are they will re-offend. Will the Minister address that matter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I welcome the fact that subsection (9) of the new section provides that "This section shall not affect the operation of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act 1998.", which allows for the release of qualifying prisoners under the Good Friday Agreement. There is no need, therefore, for me to address the situation of the five qualifying prisoners in Castlerea whom the Government has yet to release and whom it is obliged to release under the 1998 Act. Now that the courts have confirmed that these prisoners qualify for release and given the Government's promise in its programme for Government to fully implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, I can only anticipate that it will perform this act of completion with speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The power to grant temporary release to non-political prisoners is provided for in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, which provides that the Minister make rules for the temporary release of prisoners. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Finn, section 2 of the 1960 Act is constitutionally frail. It is a problem that this situation has been allowed to remain since it was originally pointed out in 2000, some three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Bill is welcome in that it does not confer new powers, but rather provides direction to the Minister in the exercise of the existing powers. It is welcome because it enhances the Minister's accountability by setting out a clearer and more transparent basis for the system of temporary release. However, we need even more transparency than appears in this Bill. Specifically, we need a transparent assessment mechanism to set risk against balancing factors such as humanitarian concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">In section 2, there is a list of what the Minister must take into account before giving a direction under subsection (1). These are slightly abstract. Who is to make the assessment for the Minister and on what will the criteria be based? How does one assess, for example, the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public? What are the mechanisms for eliciting submissions under this subsection for the Minister's consideration? Are there any mechanisms for appeal against the Minister's decision to grant or withhold temporary release?</p>
          <p eId="para_450">As the Bill stands, there is no reference to directing the duration of the temporary release, the use of discretion or whether temporary release differs from early parole. We need to examine the implications of the provisions at subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), which allow temporary release to assist in police investigations or apprehension. To my knowledge, criminals are not supposed to benefit from their crimes. This subsection directs that the Minister may allow the temporary release of a prisoner for the purpose of “assisting the Garda Síochána in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences, or the apprehension of a person guilty of an offence or suspected of having committed an offence.”  I have no problem with that, but are we going down the road of allowing prisoners to benefit from their crimes by granting them temporary release? I would like clarification of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Subsection (3) of the same section provides that temporary release will not be granted to a person serving a ten-year minimum sentence for drug trafficking. That is to be welcomed. There is a problem, however. Recently I asked the Minister how many people had been given the ten-year minimum sentence for drug trafficking or possession of drugs worth more than £10,000. Up to last year, it was only three people – I do not know where it stands at the moment. Even though the Minister may say that he has no powers in relation to directing judges in the courts, I ask that he point out the legislation to judges and reiterate its provisions because time and time again, in the past three years especially, people who have been caught in possession of drugs of a value well in excess of that figure – sometimes the equivalent of millions of pounds – have not been handed down a ten year sentence as the legislation, in my reading and that of others, directs. The deterrent factor is not there. The ten year sentence was introduced to deter the big criminal gangs from bringing huge amounts of drugs into the country and destroying our communities. While I welcome the provision in subsection (3) that will prevent drug dealers serving the minimum sentence of ten years from being released, we should try as a society to ensure that more of the criminal element who have destroyed most of my constituency – which has the highest population of male drug addicts in Europe – hear the message from the courts and from the Oireachtas that they will have to serve a ten year minimum sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I am concerned about the provision in subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), that the Minister may consider temporary release necessary or expedient to ensure good government or maintain good order or humane and just management of the prison. We need to examine the implications of this. One of the Deputies who spoke before me mentioned the open-door policy. Temporary release should not be used to ensure good management or order in prisons. In the first instance, we need to tackle the huge growth in the prison population. The probation and welfare service has pointed out that it is at a point of collapse due to the huge increase in the prison population and the reduction in funding for that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The language of this Bill needs to be gender-neutral – throughout, a person is referred to as "he". It is to be hoped that this will be corrected on Committee Stage as the majority of people in our society are female. The colossal cost of imprisonment has been in the headlines recently, in the form of the controversy over prison officers' overtime. This illustrates the pressing need for systematic identification and examination of our high economic and social cost and low social yield policies. We need to change our policy of imprisonment to one that is more socially and economically effective. This Bill does not achieve this by any stretch of the imagination. We need proper penal reform legislation which addresses all these problems. It is a pity a Bill to this effect is not forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">One of Ireland's leading criminologists, Dr. Paul O'Mahony, has made a number of observations about our prison system. The prison population has exploded since the 1960s. Even before the current large-scale planned increases, this was unprecedented in western Europe. Only a minority of prisoners are housed in decent, modern accommodation with access to appropriate facilities, as highlighted by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, and Amnesty International in its examination of the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in this State. Many prisoners live in inhumane conditions with poor sanitation and a dire lack of appropriate facilities for work, training and education – and the rehabilitation and therapy that goes with that – and recreation. Failure to address these problems resulted in the past in the widespread practice of early release. This is one of the reasons for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Irish courts overuse imprisonment as a sanction in comparison to other European countries. Looking at the make-up of the prison population, it can be seen that about 75% of those imprisoned were sent there for non-violent crime. According to the most recent figures from the National Crime Council, crimes against property make up 98% of indictable crimes. Ireland imprisons an extraordinary number of fine defaulters. Prisoners under 21 years of age make up 25% of the prison population whereas in the rest of Europe they account for only 5%. All our prisons have a pervasive drugs problem. The failure to create policies to deal with this problem has resulted in a high prevalence of diseases, particularly hepatitis C, which has reached epidemic proportions in the prison population. Many of those imprisoned are drug users. There should be a programme of treatment and rehabilitation for drug users.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">There are more prison officers than prisoners in the system. Despite all the hype, Ireland has one of the lowest crime rates in Europe but one of the highest rates of re-offending. That is one reason our prison population has exploded since the 1990s. If we had tackled the shortfalls we might not have that rate of re-offending and we would have a lower prison population to cater for, thus being of benefit both to the economy and to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Our prison system has become swollen to gigantic proportions because of the over-incarceration of non-violent prisoners serving short sentences for minor offences. The report of the Irish Prisons Service states that four out of every ten committals were for less than a period of three months; six out of ten for less than six months; and eight out of ten for less than one year. We should ask whether there is a need for those offenders to be in prison and alternative methods should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Even though our prison system has been condemned for its low standards, it is one of the most costly in the world, costing at one point £50,000 per prisoner per annum. If those under 21 years and those incarcerated for non-payment of fines were removed from the prison system, it would save the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a lot of money. It has been recommended that a reduction of 25% in the prison population over ten years could be achieved without jeopardising public safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The deputy director of criminology in the faculty of law at UCD has calculated that dealing with short-sentence prisoners by the use of community sanctions and administered by the Probation and Welfare Service or through other schemes would better serve justice and would save the Exchequer €62 million per year. The Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, could do a lot with that money. It would pay for extra gardaí, the refurbishment of Garda stations or fund rehabilitation programmes or the probation services.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Ireland's high rate of expensive imprisonment is primarily used to imprison young people and those not convicted of serious crimes. The main failing of the system is that it does not rehabilitate prisoners. We are not getting value for money. When prisoners are not rehabilitated, it is shown that they re-offend.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister asking about the rate of over-incarceration following from his public comments recognising the inherent class bias of the present system. He replied that this was not within his jurisdiction but rather within the jurisdiction of the courts. It is our collective responsibility as legislators to ensure that the law provides the right direction for the courts on the use of imprisonment and to take action to prevent its over use and abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Recently I brought a case to the attention of the Minister in which a 40 year old unemployed man was imprisoned following his failure to understand that he needed to pay a €12 dog licence. That is not justice. The system failed this man and he deserves an apology.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The director of criminology at the UCD law school has proposed a package of measures which this House should consider. He argues that there should be a greater emphasis on crime prevention and a diversion away from prosecution and imprisonment, where appropriate. He suggests a focus on restorative rather than retributive justice and a provision that prison must be the sanction of last resort for adults as well as children. Legislation should require judges to consider and rule out other options before imposing a prison sentence and they should provide reasons for their decision in writing. Prisoners should be imprisoned no longer than necessary through the introduction of a system of parole with defined eligibility periods. A system of weekend and evening custody should be considered for suitable offenders so they can remain in employment and maintain a stable family life, support their family and pay restitution. The return to prison will be less likely if policies are introduced to allow the entire sentence to be used productively to prepare the person for release and constructive re-integration.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">Táim an-bhuíoch díot as ucht an tseans a fháil labhairt ar an mBille seo inniú. I welcome this Bill which proposes an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 1960. The 1960 Act was short on specifics and does not come up to today's standards of transparency which we now expect to be applied to the exercise of ministerial powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The Corish case in 2000 in the High Court revealed the need to set out more clearly a set of criteria for the system of operation of temporary release or parole. The judgment in the Corish case was that the Minister had no power to refuse to consider temporary release for certain categories of offenders. The exclusion up to that date of sex offenders, drug offenders and murderers was due to the strong public revulsion and possible danger posed to the public due to the nature of these offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Since the Corish judgment, each case is considered on its own merits, subject to paramount concern for the safety of the public. The current practice of assessment of the risk to the public is a good one but the 1960 Act is short on specifics and criteria needed to govern the Minister's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The system of temporary release or parole is essential for the continuation of a credible modern prison system. We cannot lock up prisoners to serve their entire sentence before releasing them without consideration being given, where necessary. Temporary release serves as a humanitarian approach in helping prisoners take the important step away from crime and to start to live law-abiding lives. Compassionate grounds such as illness, the death of a relative, counselling and other services generally not available within the prison system afford the opportunity for temporary release, but they must be subject to specified periods and purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The judicial system does not put a huge emphasis on the participation of offenders. The legal aid system exists for offenders who qualify for it. Solicitors act on behalf of offenders. In the event of being sent to prison on the orders of a judge, one must learn to behave within the prison system. Obviously, their behaviour will be rewarded by acquiring skills which will help them to become better people and prepare them for the world outside. When temporary release is offered to these people, following due consideration by the Minister, it is the first opportunity offenders get to become responsible and accountable for their actions. It is important that the Minister should have a clear framework in place, taking into account the risk of granting temporary release, because the safety of the public must be paramount at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Efforts have been made throughout the country, largely by voluntary organisations, to rehabilitate offenders and make them accountable for their actions. The Minister is aware of the community reparation project in my home town of Nenagh, in which I have been closely involved, which is being run with the assistance of the Tallaght mediation service in Deputy O'Connor's constituency. This is an effort to assist offenders to be accountable and make reparation to their local community so that they will not revisit prison. Nevertheless, the temporary release system calls on prisoners to be accountable and responsible. Those who are given the opportunity should honour it, which is when their true character will emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I want to take this opportunity to commend the work of the prison service, prison officers and all those who work in the prisons. I wish to pay tribute to the probation service, in particular, which offers a service to 3,200 prisoners in 16 prisons. Some 28 probation and welfare officers are deployed in the 16 prisons. In the event of illness or maternity leave, probation officers are very often not replaced. I join with my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, in calling for greater staffing of the probation service. These highly skilled and committed people provide a wonderful service. They act on behalf of all of us in challenging offenders in regard to their behaviour and in taking responsibility for the opportunities afforded to them through temporary release, open imprisonment etc. It is important to support the probation service for which more staffing should be provided. Deputies Ó Snodaigh and O'Donovan referred to the need for a psychological service. This is a very important service which gives prisoners an opportunity to address what is important to them in life, including their reintegration into the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I welcome the Bill. It has been deemed unimportant by some Members of the Opposition, which is disappointing. Nevertheless, it is important that we have been given this opportunity to debate it, albeit on a Friday evening, in order to ensure it is passed through the House and that a proper framework is put in place so that the Minister can exercise his ministerial powers in the most transparent way possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_472">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. As Deputy Hoctor mentioned Tallaght, I am sure I can do likewise. I am the founding chairman of the mediation bureau to which she referred and the Minister and his Department have always been very supportive of that work. I attended a very worthwhile function in my constituency in Tallaght this afternoon where the local community forum, which deals with problems relating to the buses and is a partnership between the community, the Garda and Dublin Bus, was making a presentation. There were hundreds of young people in the community centre at Fettercairn. I am just relaying this to the Minister because it is important in dealing with the business before us today to reflect on the work which needs to be done in motivating young people in a positive way. We in Tallaght have had a lot of problems with vandalism and crime on buses. This is no different from anywhere else in the country. Given that Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country, there will be problems but I want to be positive about them and about the response of the Garda. The function held today pleased me. It is good to be able to attend such a positive event, come back to this House, represent my constituency and present views on the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill. If we were carrying out more community activity and ensuring as many resources as possible are put into prevention, we would not have to speak that much about our prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">It is ironic that the Minister took a decision today, on the advice of many of us, not to site a juvenile detention centre in my constituency on the green belt in Kingswood. I stand over that decision. It is important that we all continue to work together.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">I wonder whether we could finish the debate on this relatively modest Bill which I do not believe will be opposed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_489">I will do my best, but I am waiting for my colleague, Deputy Neville, with whom I wish to share time. He has a speech prepared, which I also happen to have. I am sorry the Bill is not coming back to the House for another day. I want to make a quick comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I have taken an interest over the years in the temporary and early release of prisoners. One requirement must be borne in mind and a number of other speakers have referred to it. It is not the question of expediency but of whether it is right to release the prisoner at a particular time. One must forget about expediency, numbers and costs and think about the general good of the public who will have to suffer the consequences if something goes wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I have studied the Bill with care. The Minister does not want me to go through it now but I would take great pleasure in going through it in detail. I have had occasion in the past to make a case on behalf of a family where it was felt that the prisoner could be released because he had suffered remorse and had reformed. I found it difficult to get a dramatic response in such cases. On the other hand, however, I have seen dramatic results in questionable cases. The Minister is correct that there must be a standard format which can be applied and that does not err. The release should not take place just for reasons of expediency.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I am disappointed that the debate on the Bill is to conclude this evening. The Minister might consider it urgent but if it was that urgent the Bill should have been brought to the House at some earlier stage between last November and now. My colleague, Deputy Neville, wishes to contribute. This debate does not have to conclude today, given that it was November when the Bill last came before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I ask Deputy Neville to consider concluding the debate this evening. The Bill seems to have all-party support and whatever amendments are required should be made on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Records and research show that up to 78% of people who are put into solitary confinement in padded cells are mentally ill. This is a serious problem. It is so serious that I must criticise the Government. However, it is an international problem as well as an Irish problem. Up to 40% of people who are in prison should be in a mental hospital. I have gathered some international research on this but, to facilitate the Minister, I will not discuss it in detail. I have seen the padded cell in Mountjoy.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">It is very unpleasant.</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_496">It is. There is just a mattress, a blanket and a slop out, and sometimes that is not there. Of the people who are put in that cell, 78% suffer mental illness, are suicidal or are psychotic and in need of psychiatric help. They do not get it. That has been the case since before the Minister took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I can offer some examples. A person was 12 days in solitary confinement because of depression and self-mutilation. Another was there for six days for self-mutilation and another was there for five days for self-inflicted wounds. This information comes from case studies. Approximately 78% of entrants into padded cell isolation units are clearly suffering some level of psychiatric or psychological disorder. To use these cells as a substitute for appropriate medical or paramedical services is a scandal. It is a denial of prisoners' human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Minister should also look at the jail alternative programme that has been working in the United States. I have studied what has happened in Alaska and the Irish Penal Trust has also examined it. Special courts were set up for the mentally ill by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services. The judge is trained in the mental health area to examine the offender and to get the necessary reports. He or she can make a decision that the person has a mental condition and that there should be an alternative to jail by way of a programme which would treat his or her problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Research into the pilot study in Alaska has shown that there is less recidivism, a reduction in crime, a reduction in the number of people in prison and a saving to the state. It has all the ingredients – it is cost effective and deals with the prisoner's problem. Society, the Government and the Minister, as head of the system, should seriously examine what is happening in this area and develop an alternative system to deal with people who are mentally ill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_500">Deputy Neville made two points of considerable importance. The first related to padded cells. I have visited a number of prisons and seen the padded cells. After my first visit to a padded cell I formed the view that they had to be changed. I have requested the director of the Irish Prisons Service, Seán Aylward, to prepare a report on replacing these cells with bright, sunlit observation units. The cells the Deputy saw have been criticised on a number of occasions by the United Nations committee on torture. I expect to receive proposals in the next few weeks for changing these cells throughout our prison system. That is one element of progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">With regard to the broader issue of diversion of people who are suffering from personality, psychological and psychiatric problems from the Irish Prisons Service, I will take on board Deputy Neville's and other contributors' remarks during this debate. There is a need for a statute which would set out sentencing principles on a rational basis. I am not ignoring the point about the fasttrack channel mentioned by Deputy Neville for people who have personality, psychiatric or psychological problems. Generally, however, I accept the point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh that we must have a system which regards imprisonment as the last resort and which actively explores every other alternative before sending people to jail, except in the most obvious and outstanding cases where that would be redundant.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I thank Deputies for their contributions. This measure has been around for some time and is one of the less headline grabbing, housekeeping exercises with which this House must deal. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate. If worthwhile amendments are proposed on that Stage, I will be glad to accept them in a spirit of partnership. Clement Attlee was described by Winston Churchill as a modest little man with a lot to be modest about. This is a modest Bill and should not be the subject of significant parliamentary delay although it should, of course, be the subject of adequate parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
