          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 to 99, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The census 2002 preliminary report, based on summary information assembled during the field-work, was published on 24 July 2002. The main finding of the preliminary report was that the population increased by over 290,000 persons between 1996 and 2002 to reach its highest level since 1871. The preliminary total for the population enumerated on census night, 28 April 2002, was 3,917,336 persons compared with 3,626,087 in April 1996, representing an increase of 8% in six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The populations of Kildare and Meath, with increases of over 29,003 and over 24,204, respectively, both increased by over a fifth between 1996 and 2002. Other Leinster counties which showed large increases were Westmeath with an increase of 13.8%, Wexford with an increase of 11.7%, Laois with an increase of 10.9%, Louth with an increase of 10.5% and Carlow with an increase of 10.2%. Overall, the increase in the population of Dublin was 6.1%, which was somewhat lower than for the State as a whole. Cork city was the only administrative county in the State to register a population decline while for the first time on record the population of Leitrim has shown an increase with figures up 3% since 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The CSO is committed to finalising the data capture phase of the census processing by the end of April this year and this work is proceeding on schedule. Following this it is planned to release the definitive demographic results from the census by the middle of 2003 and to follow this up with the remaining socio-economic results towards the latter part of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">I note the Minister of State did not refer to Cavan and Monaghan in the list of counties she mentioned. Does she agree that one of the most remarkable findings of the census is that for the first time ever net immigration into this State is higher than the natural increase in population? Will she join me in welcoming this development and welcoming people of diverse origins to our country? Will she also join me in welcoming the multi-cultural Ireland that this is creating and the major contribution immigrant communities and workers are making to the Irish economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Does the Minister of State recognise that Government policy on immigration and asylum is having a negative consequence? Does she agree that non-EU immigrants need to be given the right to work and the dignity of the right to work—</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I have been asking questions of the Minister of State. Does she agree that it would be desirable that all people in our communities would be afforded the dignity of work while their papers or whatever are being processed and that they would not be placed under what I regard as the chattel system which currently operates where their permits are held by employers rather than by the people themselves?</p>

          <p eId="para_16">The Deputy will be interested to know that the census figures for Cavan and Monaghan show an increase of 6.6% and 2.8%, respectively. The Deputy will also have received from me a copy of the preliminary report, which I circulated to all Members knowing that they might have more than a passing interest in the figures in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">It is to be welcomed that Government policy has ensured that young people who left the country ten years ago were able to return and find employment, that the employment situation is such that people of all nationalities are able to obtain employment in Ireland, that investors are coming to the country and that there is a net increase in population. It is to the credit of Government policies in education and investment in the economy that we have witnessed an increase in population.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">It is also to be welcomed that we are witnessing greater cultural diversity. I visited a school last year in which I was welcomed in 11 different languages by the children. That is something from which we can all benefit.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_19">Does the Minister of State agree it is clear that there is a pattern in the Central Statistics Office figures she mentioned for counties, be they Cavan, Monaghan, Carlow or my area of Fingal, that points to an alarming and growing trend of sucking the population towards the centre, almost like a plug hole for the country, and that the congestion in which we are drowning in the Dublin region is counter-balanced by the denuding of other areas where the population is declining and infrastructure wanting? Will the Minister of State take lessons from the CSO figures in the context of the national development plan or the spatial strategy which still seem to pander to the demand for greater infrastructure in the eastern region to try to cope with the enormous burden of congestion in the area? Does the Minister of State see lessons for other Departments, especially the Department of Transport, regarding the additional runway at Dublin Airport when other airports are in need of traffic and Dublin Airport is oversubscribed?</p>
          <p eId="para_20">What does the Government propose to do in response to these CSO figures? Will the 40% cut in the CSO spending allocation hinder the work of the agency, especially the national employment survey, over which I understand a question mark hangs because of the cutbacks?</p>

          <p eId="para_21">The funding of the CSO is the subject of questions which will be taken shortly. The work of the agency will not be hindered but I will give greater detail later.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">What the Deputy said about rural areas and other counties outside Dublin is untrue. If he examines the figures I circulated to him, he will see there has been an increase in population in every county and the only area which showed a decrease—</p>

          <p eId="para_35">What we do not yet have from the Central Statistics Office is a breakdown by area. We have the preliminary report of the overall figures. This July will see the publication of two tables which will be of particular benefit in the electoral process. One will show males and females in each constituency, as defined in the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1998, for the purposes of elections to Dáil Éireann. In July we will have the table showing what each constituency has by way of population. We will also have a table showing what we have in each county and city local electoral area. Those figures will only become available in July and it is important they are used to the best advantage in planning for all elections.</p>

What action does the Department of the Taoiseach intend to take, for example, on transport and employment? As already mentioned by Deputy Gay Mitchell what are the electoral repercussions? When will decisions be taken arising from figures that are still to emerge in July or thereafter? When will action be taken to provide for the now clear implications in the figures?</p>

          <p eId="para_37">As I have already stated, where the population lives has a bearing on investment, infrastructure, etc. I am sure all Ministers take it into account when planning. A particular note would be taken of areas that need investment to encourage further employment. It would also have a bearing on the siting of educational institutions and as mentioned earlier, infrastructure. It would be premature at this stage to decide what would happen on electoral boundaries. However, when the figures become available in July decisions on that will have to be made.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_39">Based on the figures for the Cork County Borough administrative area, the Government needs to be proactive in having a realistic boundary for Cork city. What has happened in Cork city is a classic case of the doughnut effect. The capacity to grow in Cork city no longer exists because there is no building land available. Growth has been considerable on the outskirts of Cork city. The boundaries have not changed since 1965. The population has been growing exponentially in Carrigaline, Ballincollig, Douglas, Grange, Frankfield and Rochestown, and on the north side in Glanmire and in Blarney. The Government needs to recognise this by giving Cork city proper boundaries beyond which it cannot grow in the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_40">Was the Minister of State surprised that Cork city as Ireland's second largest city was the only area in the country that saw a decrease in population? People in Cork were not surprised at that, partly as a result of what Deputy Boyle has said. Does the Government intend to prioritise investment in Cork city in order to rejuvenate the city centre? This is clearly needed to get people moving back into city living as opposed to having a policy that encourages the doughnut effect of people living in large suburban housing estates.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_41">I was not half as surprised at the declining figures for Cork City as was my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. The population of the overall Cork area has increased by 6.6%. I was perhaps more interested in my constituency area whose population only increased by 0.7%. I do not hear anybody suggesting there should be greater investment there. Everybody seems to believe the Minister of State with responsibility for the CSO, which means statistics, is in charge of everything. Most of the items about which I have been asked do not come within my remit. Suffice it to say that the use of statistics is central to the deliberations on Government policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">According to the statistics the population of Drogheda has grown by 15.9% since the last census and is now the largest town in the north east and not just in County Louth. Given that the Government has left Drogheda out of the national spatial strategy does the Minister not think it is time to establish a commission to look at the future of local government control in Drogheda? In view of the fact that Drogheda is now planning for a population of 100,000 people, will the Government designate Drogheda a city and include it in the national spatial strategy?</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_50">Last week the Taoiseach informed the House that our population now exceeds four million people. Was he relying on the household budget survey or other survey for this new information? Was he indicating there is an inaccuracy in the preliminary census returns which I have before me? What was the basis of his statement, which he made in a very definitive manner?</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I welcome the indication from the preliminary returns that the population of Connacht has increased by nearly 11%. I also note that there have been massive population increases in the north and west sides of Dublin and the population of Fingal county, some of which is in my constituency, has increased by 17%. Does the Minster of State agree that based on these statistics, it is critical that we have a system of integrated planning in the north and west fringes of Dublin and in Fingal county, particularly with regard to the development of current transport capacity and the provision of new modes of transport? In this context, I welcome the presence of the Minister for Transport. Does the Minister of State also agree that the figures demand that the development set out in the national development plan be urgently revised?</p>
          <p eId="para_52">The Minister of State stated we will not be in a position to make decisions on the European and local elections until July. By waiting until the month of the run-in to the elections, are we not leaving it too late to address this matter, in particular for the large number of people who are looking forward to standing in the local elections, not to speak of the major campaigns for the European elections? Do the forthcoming elections not oblige the Minister of State to try to accelerate the process of undertaking local and national boundary revisions?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The figure to which the Taoiseach referred was only 33,664 above the preliminary figures. Due to their nature, preliminary figures do not take account of late returns made since the report in question was published.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">While the preliminary figure is very accurate, it is probably not definitive. In addition, the figures were compiled in April 2002, which is almost a year ago. I am sure our population has grown a little since then. It would be irresponsible to pre-empt the results of the figures due in July on the area populations by considering changes to the boundaries prior to that. However, it is important that they are considered. As the Deputy stated, the final figures will have a major bearing on some of the areas in which the population has grown substantially for electoral purposes. In terms of the national development plan, all Government policies are constantly being reviewed as a result of a range of demands, one of which is statistics on population.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 to 103, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The second Information Society Commission was appointed by the Taoiseach towards the end of 2001. It is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of DCU, and draws on high-level representation from the business community, the social partners and the public sector. The commission acts as an independent advisory body to the Government and so is in a position to play a key role in shaping the ongoing development of information society policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">As an independent advisory body, the commission is responsible for developing and pursuing its own work programme. The secretariat to support the work of the commission is being provided by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The terms of reference of the commission are to highlight the challenges and opportunities presented by information society developments; to monitor Ireland's performance in its evolution as an information society, both nationally and internationally; to identify areas of co-operation with other jurisdictions, including establishment of links with the Northern Ireland information age initiative; and to establish working groups, as required, to provide expert advice on specific areas of public policy development.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The commission published its first report to Government on 19 December 2002, outlining its main findings and recommendations to date. In addition, the commission published simultaneously a separate report on relevant legal issues prepared by its legal affairs working group. I launched both reports on 19 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The recommendations are being taken forward in the context of the ongoing work of the Cabinet committee together with the implementation group of assistant secretaries and individual Departments.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_74">Will the Minister of State agree that an important spin-off from the work of the Information Society Commission should be urgent investment in primary schools to equip them with information technology? Will the Minister indicate the progress envisaged in that regard following on from the publication of the report? Will she agree that the work of the Information Society Commission should be geared to the widest availability of information so that the decisions taken are informed and are for the benefit of society and that more areas of society are enabled to be facilitated with the benefits provided by information systems? Will she agree also that there is a major contradiction between that aspiration and the closing down of information envisaged in the restrictions in the Freedom of Information Act which the Government is currently proposing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_51">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_75">Information technology in schools is one of the key planks of the development of the information society, as are those people at the other end of the scale who have little access to computers and IT facilities. The Deputy will be aware of the blueprint for the future of ICT in primary and second level schools. A total of €78.72 million was allocated for the support of ICT in schools at the end of 2001 and over 2002, of which €5 million went specifically towards pupils with special needs. Further investment is being made in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">In addition to that a support network is needed in schools. It is not sufficient just to have the Internet connection or the hardware. There has to be a support network for the teachers. The sum of €20 million has been allocated over a two year period to fund a national advisory and support network for training for teachers and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">It is worth noting in this area that we are moving to a second level now that every school in the country has Internet access and good rates for access from Eircom, with Eircom also agreeing to extend and enhance that rate for another year. It is not just a matter of having computers in schools for the sake of it but integrating them into the curriculum. That is the next stage and we are anxious to move on it so that computers are used actively to teach Irish, history and so on. I see great opportunities in that area. Second chance education, further and higher education, e-learning and social inclusion are also important but the question related particularly to schools and I agree with the Deputy that this is very important. That is why the investment is in place and why we are moving on the curriculum.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The Deputy will also have noted that matters related to the information society have been included in the new draft social partnership agreement. This is the first time that has happened and it is welcome. We see it as ensuring the information society is available to all. This does not relate to freedom of information, it relates to the information society.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Will the Minister of State outline her responsibilities, as Minister for e-government, in ensuring that the recommendations of the December report are implemented? Second, what are her views on the fact that a recent World Economic Forum report ranked Ireland 51st in a global ranking of broadband availability?

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_82">I am referring to it. Is it not to the shame of the Government and the previous Administration that we now find ourselves in 51st place in a world ranking of broadband accessibility? We are supposed to consider ourselves a relatively hi-tech information society and to be proud that we are the largest exporter of software in the world, despite being a small country. However, our telecommunications infrastructure is making us very uncompetitive as a destination for foreign investment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_83">My role involves monitoring progress in implementing the new action plan on the information society, New Connections, and we have just issued our first progress report on that plan. There are seven strands within it: telecommunications infrastructure, the legal and regulatory environment, e-government, e-business, research and development, lifelong learning and e-inclusion. In handling those I deal with different Ministers but it is important to point out that individual Ministers retain responsibility for those individual areas, which is why the question the Deputy raised on broadband is one he can raise in a few minutes with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who has direct responsibility for this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">I arrange for co-ordination of this work not just because I am physically based in the Department of the Taoiseach, with a unit of that Department working on the information society, but the Cabinet sub-committee on the information society is chaired by the Taoiseach. Where there are interdepartmental logjams – information society issues cut across several Departments – the excellent policy group and the sub-committee can free those up.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The Deputy referred to a survey on broadband and I am sure he would like to quote from the EU surveys which show we are top of the rankings on e-government. We have been number one or two in that regard for a long time.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_87">The EU surveys show our present position. The broadband telecommunications infrastructure is crucially important to me. One of the main aims set out in the New Connections document is that we put in place high quality, high speed, affordable telecommunications services that are available to all citizens and businesses. I commend the work the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has done and continues to do in this area. He will answer questions on the issue himself.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_88">I agree totally with Deputy Joe Higgins that it is extraordinary the Minister of State with responsibility for information is also the Government Chief Whip who this week in the Seanad and next week in the Dáil will force through the most narrowly focused public information regime in Europe and return us to a 1984-style society. It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">The Minister of State referred to her role as a supervisor. We have all read New Connections. What is the problem with the Reach programme? It was supposed to help with the establishment of the public service broker for the Department of Social and Family Affairs but there are reports that the Reach contracts have not gone to tender and that there has been delay after delay. The Taoiseach, the person with responsibility for the programme, did not know the answer when I asked him about this two weeks ago. There is a huge logjam in the Minister of State's Department that is holding up the wonderful developments she outlined. What is happening to the tenders for the Reach programme?</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The Minister of State mentioned cheap rate access for school computers but the Government continues to divide society. Provision for electronic inclusion is a shambles and a huge proportion of socially disadvantaged and lower income families have not a ghost of a chance of being connected to a broadband network because of the policies of the Minister of State and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. The Minister of State is creating a divided society on the basis of electronic exclusion and it is a shocking indictment of her role as e-Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_91">The Reach agency, which is answerable to the Minister and Department of Social and Family Affairs, is making progress with the public services broker. The procurement process is ongoing and tenders are now in and are being considered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_61">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_93">It would be inappropriate to comment other than to say that the tenders are in and are being considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">E-inclusion and lifelong learning are central planks of New Connections. The first progress report on New Connections, published last month, highlights the initiatives which have been and continue to be taken. There has been an increase in Internet services for the community and voluntary sector. Muintir na Tíre has developed a project to connect all its constituent groups with a high degree of success. The CAIT initiative established 121 projects across the State to ensure those living in more isolated areas have access.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Capacity building is a key feature of the work. It is pointless giving people broadband access if they do not know how to use it or if there are no services available. The whole aim of e-government is to ensure that people can apply for car tax, passports and driving licences on-line. At the moment people can find a great deal through BASIS for business information and Reach for general services.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">We have launched programmes of equal skills that focus on inclusion. By concentrating on access for those with disabilities to the information society we are opening up a whole new world. Accessibility guidelines have been launched as well as new websites, public access terminals, software applications and telecoms. Huge progress has been made in this area. If I may digress, one of the most impressive things I saw recently in relation to access for people with disability was in St. Joseph's residential home for adults who are deaf-blind. There, <i>The Irish Times </i>was being printed out in Braille from Ireland. com so that people could read today's newspaper today. Heretofore, they were reading English news arriving from England a month late. That is real accessibility for people with disability, opening up a whole new world. That is the essence of New Connections.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_97">Is the Minister of State alarmed by the apparent drop in Ireland's position in the international league in this regard? Eight or ten years ago, Ireland seemed to be at the cutting edge, playing a central role and competing against all others. Now, our position seems to be slipping, with the exception of e-government to which the Minister of State has just referred and which appears to be conducted in an environment of smoke and mirrors, with the emphasis on the smoke aspect. Will the Minister of State indicate whether Ireland's competitiveness is likely to be affected by the fact that we are in the middle 50s in the international league while, at the same time, we are one of the top ten wealthiest countries in the world?</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_98">No, I do not accept that. There are a number of elements which attract investment into this country, one of which is our infrastructure. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources made a recent announcement in relation to 19 towns and issued policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation, including arrangements for flat rate Internet access. Those developments are making a real difference to people, including those coming into the country and those who are here already.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">The information society fund, from which all of those developments are funded, is €42 million this year. That will go towards funding a substantial number of projects throughout the country, some continuing from last year and some new initiatives, to tackle those areas most in need. With regard to the Deputy's reference to elderly people, the Department of the Taoiseach is about to initiate a survey among the general public to establish who is making access and what people really want in terms of access in the information age. We are looking particularly at five groups that have been identified by other surveys and by the Information Society Commission as those who could benefit from more access. These include women whose main duties are in the home, tradesmen and skilled workers, people employed in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the unemployed and the retired.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">While we may refer to schools and young people, those about whom we are mainly concerned are the late adopters, constituting 55% of people. In the case of women whose main duties are in the home, 78% do not have access. These are the facts and this is what we must deal with. Some 68% of those tradesmen to whom I referred do not have access. Some 85% in agriculture, forestry and fishing do not have access. Yet huge initiatives are taking place at Government level to ensure that people can get information, grants etc. on-line and therefore it is important these people feel comfortable with the systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Some 73% of the unemployed do not have access. We find that, through the initiative in the libraries, these are the very people who are making most use of it. Some 90% of retired people do not have access – for those people who have access it opens up a whole new world. The Sunset group I met in Ennis have their own website where they communicate with each other and produce newsletters etc. This is the type of initiative which we are encouraging throughout the country through the information society.</p>

Does she agree that in the information society age there is a huge incongruity that the computer mouse is joined by real live rodents in a number of schools, as headmasters have graphically told us? Does she agree that if the implementation of investment in information society means anything, it means classrooms that are up to par, with rodents, apart from the computer mouse, left outside the classroom door?</p>

          <p eId="para_120">At what stage is the e-procurement process of Government? The normal mode of behaviour of many companies is to have auctions on-line and some companies operate on a daily auction basis in the procurement area. To what extent does that operate in the Office of Public Works, for example, or in the Government service?</p>

          <p eId="para_122">In answer to Deputy Coveney's question, I am responsible for the provision of services in e-government. This is why assistant secretaries and indeed Secretaries General of each of the Departments whom I have met are constantly being driven to ensure that they see what services can be provided on-line. These services are provided not just for the sake of providing them, but the public will want to and will be able to access them. One of the most successful, and indeed prize-winning, ones to date has been that of the Revenue Commissioners, who have provided an excellent service for people. I am not sure whether this is because it is on-line or because one gets three weeks extra in which to pay, but it shows what can be done by Government services.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">The preparation of draft legislation to give effect to the fundamental reform of public service broadcasting, as announced by me on 11 December 2002, has already begun. That legislation will give effect to the decision to establish the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as the new content regulator and to re-establish RTE as a commercial State company. The authority will take on the functions of the existing Broadcasting Commission of Ireland with certain regulatory functions that are currently the responsibility of the RTE Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">My Department is considering the elements to be included in the legislation and will consult the sector as this work is advanced. The task is complex and it is too soon to say when publication of legislative proposals can be expected or when thereafter the new broadcasting authority will be up and running. In the meantime, draft legislation is being prepared separately to bring into operation the special broadcasting fund. This fund will be for new and innovative additional public service programming. It will be open to all free-to-air broadcasters, including RTE and independent broadcasters licensed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. This legislation will be introduced ahead of the legislation establishing the new content regulator and I intend to bring heads of a Bill to Government in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I asked this question in the context of the significant licence fee increase announced before Christmas, a decision that had the agreement of the majority in this House. Clearly, a main component of the reasoning behind the increase was that we should have a new content regulator for both public and private broadcasters, with an independent regulator for RTE. Why are we now looking at a possible minimum of 18 months, according to my information, before we see the new authority up and running?</p>
          <p eId="para_132">A figure of €7 out of every €150 paid in licence fees was mentioned. How will this be administered? How does the Minister propose that RTE will be monitored and regulated independently on behalf of the public to ensure that we get value for money, now that we are paying €150 per year? Nothing has changed in relation to the independent monitoring of RTE. Until the new authority is up and running RTE will continue to monitor itself. Is the Minister satisfied with this? How can he justify a licence fee increase of this magnitude without following through quickly on the promises he made?</p>

          <p eId="para_134">As anybody in the management of RTE can confirm, the contact between my Department and RTE since the licence fee increase has been even more significant than it was prior to the application being made.

In a significant move, we are taking the regulatory functions away from the RTE Authority and giving them to an independent authority. The Deputy asked what would happen in relation to monitoring and alleged that RTE would be free to do whatever it wanted. That is not the case. At the moment the Department is discussing in detail with RTE the statement of commitments, which will show a baseline from where it is to proceed over the next year. It deals with how RTE is to increase the content it said it would, specifically in relation to programmes and other initiatives. The results will be independently monitored at the end of this year, by which time, as the Deputy said, the new BAI will not yet be in place.

       if the Government's plans for the information society, as outlined in the report, New Connections, of February 2003, are being affected by his Department's approach to broadband infrastructure and competition in the telecommunications sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [6393/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_141">My Department's activities in the area of providing broadband infrastructure and services are a key element of the Government's plans for the development of the information society, as outlined in the report, New Connections. The widest possible availability of competitive services, including the widespread availability of affordable broadband access, has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">While the provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to accelerate and promote investment in telecommunications infrastructure. These investments will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries and welfare and health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">In 1999, 13 projects rolling out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value of €70 million were supported and are now completed. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. To date, ten private sector contracts have been signed under the plan. Projects funded include the construction of a new national fibre-optic backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Energis, the extension by Esat of its national network and the acceleration of the Esat and Eircom roll-out of DSL. My Department is also funding the construction of open-access metropolitan area fibre-optic networks in more than 19 towns and in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin to facilitate the provision by the private sector of advanced communications services to consumers, educational establishments and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €60 million. Construction of networks has commenced in Cork and Galway and will commence shortly in Mayo. Further projects will commence once contracts have been completed, about which I will let the House know.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">There have also been some recent significant regulatory developments to improve access to the information society.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"><i>Additional information</i>On 21 February 2003 I issued policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulations in accordance with section 13 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002. They focus on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat-rate Internet access. These policy directions, together with a report on the public consultation process, have been published on my Department's website. The text of the policy directions, together with the reasons for their introduction, have also been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_146">A Fine Gael Deputy referred to a table that ranks Ireland 51st in the world in its level of broadband infrastructure. The OECD report, referred to by the Minister last year, placed Ireland 27th out of 30 and a recent Dublin Chamber of Commerce report placed Dublin city in the bottom division of nations in the area of broadband provision and on-line availability. More recently, the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O'Flynn, gave me a copy of the global information technology report 2002-03 which is a highly regarded report on Internet readiness and the role of e-commerce in society. This report places Ireland 21st behind such countries as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Given the Government parties' election promise to have the entire country on a fast broadband system by 2005, is it not the case that negative reports by external monitors show that the Government needs to do better? It seems that the Government has announced the MAN network for each of the 19 towns involved on an individual basis. In order to provide an always-on, fast broadband network, the Government should be delivering to the 123 towns earmarked in the national development plan rather than just the largest 19. Is it not the case that the Government has, to date, signally failed to get to grips with broadband infrastructure?</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The Minister has directed the Commission for Communications Regulation with regard to flat-rate Internet access for the FRIACO development later this summer, but is this not too little too late? This issue is critical to our economic progress and must be addressed in the months ahead. I was astonished to hear the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, tell us there is no e-procurement procedure in place. One of the key elements of her responsibilities is to create an e-procurement development for the Government, but it has not happened. In fact, the Minister of State said there was no such thing.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_151">Some of the reports and statistics to which the Deputy refers are a couple of years old. The roll-out of broadband this year and next will dramatically increase our position and rating in that regard and we are one of the leaders into research on wireless technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">It is ironic that the Labour Party is criticising the Government, given that the party only mentioned broadband once in its pre-election documents, in which it said that its national spatial strategy document would refer to broadband and how it would be rolled out. We are still waiting for that document. At least my party had a fully-fledged and dedicated document in which we promised the type of policy we would implement if returned to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Until I mentioned FRIACO, neither Deputy Broughan nor Deputy Coveney seemed to know what it was. I am taking initiatives in relation to FRIACO and driving DSL and other access rates down. Aligned to this, is better connection through wireless LAN and the roll-out under the previous and current national development plans through which ESAT and Eircom received significant amounts of taxpayers money in order to roll out broadband. As a result of all of this, Ireland will soon be at the top of the league table in regard to broadband connectivity.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_155">At present there are 14 licensed passenger boats in Mayo and the maritime safety directorate of my Department has received a further eight applications for the inspection of vessels for passenger boat licences in the Mayo and Sligo areas. These vessels will be inspected as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I appreciate the concerns of the Connacht branch of the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers, IFSA, regarding the possible effects the new passenger boat regulations, which came into effect on 1 January 2003, may have on sea angling festivals and competitions, particularly where there may be difficulties in bringing old fishing vessels up to the required safety standard. However, as Minister, my primary concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waterways. While sea-angling festivals are of importance in tourism terms, we cannot build our tourism industry on a poor safety regime. There is a long-term benefit to the tourism industry in being able to demonstrate that the highest safety standards are adhered to in sea angling and I urge sea angling clubs and festival organisers to avail of the boats that are already licensed. To facilitate boat owners affected by the new regulations and in response to a request from the Connacht provincial council of the IFSA, an information seminar on the passenger boat regulations will be held on 25 March in Westport, County Mayo. I assure the Deputy that my Department will assist vessel owners in every way possible to comply with the new regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">These regulations will kill the goose that laid the golden egg. The IFSA competitions are worth some €3 million to €5 million, annually, benefiting disadvantaged areas such as Belmullet, Corraun, Mulranny, Newport and others. Killala Bay and Clew Bay have hosted the world sea-angling competitions. These men are already operating to a safe standard and are interested in looking after their clients, so they do not want them to drown. Indeed, in 50 years, there has never been a drowning at an IFSA competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">These regulations make it particularly difficult because one cannot get insurance without a safety statement, life-jacket and safety boat. Does the Minister not agree that it is totally impractical to enforce this law which means people can use a boat for fishing every day but need a licence if they go out on an IFSA sea-angling trip? The Minister has already said there are only eight such licensed boats in Mayo but some 85%—</p>

          <p eId="para_161">Some 85% of these competitions take place in County Mayo. These boats are all over Mayo – the third largest county in the country – so it is impractical to get them together.

          <p eId="para_162">I understand there is a requirement for 20 licensed boats for fishing competitions in Belmullet. There are 14 licensed vessels, with eight more to be inspected. I do not agree with the Deputy when he refers to what is happening as "overkill". One cannot "overkill" on safety. I would be in dereliction of my duty if I did not require minimum safety at sea standards and see to it that they are adhered to. There have been awful incidents in our history where people have gone on to the water but failed to meet even the minimum safety standards. As Minister, I will not stand over that. I will insist on minimum safety standards and not accept anything less.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">While I have sympathy for the organisers of sea angling festivals, the use of boats that meet safety standards will benefit the tourism industry and the organisers. People spend large amounts of money going to festivals, taking sea-angling trips and purchasing equipment. For an unknown reason we have tended not to invest sufficiently in safety equipment – and not only in this area. As someone with experience of being on the sea, I will not allow anything other than boats that meet the minimum recommended safety standards.</p>

      <b>Mr. Coveney</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       if sufficient oil reserves are in place here in the event of a war on Iraq; and the measures he has taken to this effect.
      [6408/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_167">As a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. On 31 December 2002, the latest date for which comprehensive figures are available, Ireland's emergency oil reserves, whether held at home or in other EU member states, amounted to the equivalent of 123 days of net imports using the IEA methodology. The EU average is 115 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">In the event of significant disruption to global oil supplies these reserves would be eked out over an extended period to supplement supplies that would be available in the normal course so as to provide cover far in excess of their nominal duration. For example, if there was a 10% reduction in world oil supplies, a level of disruption unprecedented over the past four decades, then our current reserves would last for more than 1,200 days – well over three years. They would last even longer if account were taken of the reduction in consumption that would be achieved by the demand restraint measures that would be triggered by a crisis of this magnitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The consensus view on the implications of an outbreak of war in Iraq is that while there would probably be a temporary rise in oil prices, there would be no significant adverse impact on global oil supplies. This view is underpinned by the declared intention of OPEC to increase production accordingly should any shortfall occur. This undertaking was repeated by OPEC's general secretary at an informal meeting of EU energy Ministers that I attended on 22 February. In these circumstances, it would be very difficult to justify making any special efforts at today's high oil prices to add to national oil reserves that are already at record high levels, and there are no proposals to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">There would be no question of Ireland or any other oil consuming country attempting to deal on its own with an interruption in oil supplies from the Gulf. If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supply, would take place primarily within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the IEA. Under that regime, member states would be entitled to a share of available oil in the event of a reduction of at least 7% in normal global supply levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"><i>Additional information</i>There are also provisions for a co-ordinated international response to an emerging crisis, without the oil-sharing component, in advance of the 7% trigger. It is widely considered that a measured response along these lines, rather than what could be construed as panic measures by individual member states, is the appropriate way to address current concerns about oil supplies from the Gulf. I am satisfied that Ireland's emergency stock levels are more than sufficient to ensure that we would be in a position to participate effectively in an internationally co-ordinated response in the unlikely event of oil supply disruptions as a result of developments in the Iraqi crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">While I accept that we may well have 123 days oil supply, how many days of this supply is held on this island or in the Republic of Ireland? What percentage of our oil stocks is not held on this island? Four oil tanks with a capacity of 600,000 barrels each currently lie empty at Whiddy Island oil terminal. Would it not be prudent to fill some of that capacity to ensure we have the necessary fall back position should a prolonged war in Iraq make this country vulnerable through difficulty in obtaining oil?</p>

          <p eId="para_174">OPEC and Saudi Arabia have already publicly undertaken to increase oil production in the event of war. OPEC's secretary general confirmed this at the informal EU Council of Ministers meeting I attended a fortnight ago. When Ireland's position was compared to that of other countries at that meeting it was found to be one of the best. While Ireland holds 123 days oil supply, it is slightly misleading given that it assumes a 100% collapse in the market. Global oil supplies experienced an 11% shortfall during the Suez Crisis in 1956-57. At that time countries were required to hold 90 days of stocks and that would have provided cover for 26 months. Oil supplies fell by 8.6% during the Iranian crisis in 1979 but stocks would have provided cover for 35 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Ireland's oil stocks are split into three parts. One-third is wholly owned by NORA, the agency with responsibility for looking after oil stocks. A further one-third is held by the industry and is regarded as being available to us if needed. The final one-third, known as ticketed stocks, is held outside this country. Even taking only those stocks available on the island we are well ahead. Every other country, apart from Germany, has recourse to this ticketed oil supply.</p>

      <b>Mr. Ferris</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the reason the system of quota allocation management by monthly statutory instrument differs here from the system in place in other EU states such as Britain, France and Spain.
      [6097/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_185">Once total allowable catches are established and allocated at EU level as national quotas between member states, their subsequent management is a matter within the sole responsibility of each member state. Such a division in responsibility is appropriate and enables member states to manage their national quotas to take account of the specific characteristics of their fisheries. Accordingly, it is to be expected that differing quota management systems will operate in different member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Our existing whitefish quota management system is designed to ensure, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, the best possible spread between fishermen and also in terms of take-up of quota during the year. A key objective is the avoidance of early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota. Under the current arrangements in Ireland, fishing industry representatives are invited each month to an advisory committee on whitefish quota management and their views are taken into account in the determination of monthly regimes for particular stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">To date Ireland's whitefish quotas have been regarded as national assets and, as such, they are treated as a public resource that is available to all fishing vessels which are licensed to fish the particular stock. In contrast, in some other member states, systems have evolved whereby quotas have become a commodity and are purchased by vessel owners. It is, effectively, a privatisation process, with which the Deputy would not agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">My Department is currently examining quota management generally and I expect to receive a report shortly. Any future quota management system must be consistent with the need to fulfil the various legal requirements on member states to manage and respect their national quotas. It also must be capable of ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of quota among Irish fishermen.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I am delighted the Minister is examining quota management and the allocation of quota. Does the Minister agree that the system which operates in other EU countries, where there is a direct input from fishing industry representatives, is a better way of establishing a more harmonised approach by both the state and the people involved in the industry? If so, what steps does he intend to take to achieve that?</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Does the Minister agree that the system of penalties in this State is far more severe than in other EU countries? The penalties in this country for serious breaches are almost twice the EU average. The average penalty fine in this country is more than €7,000. In other member states, it is less than €1,000 and as low as €600 for similar offences. Does the Minister not consider that unfair since 50% of the fishing vessels boarded within our waters and brought before the courts are Irish vessels? There is disillusionment among the fishing organisations that on most occasions serious breaches are brought before the Circuit Court whereas other EU vessels are brought before the District Court. That makes the fine and bond involved far more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">With regard to the conservation box, will the Government ensure, in the negotiations under the western water agreement, that the Irish conservation box will be preserved and not allowed to be exploited by other countries which have that design at present?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_122">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_192">Absolutely. The conservation issue in the Irish box is what I am fighting for on behalf of the Irish people. With regard to quotas, the stocks of all whitefish species have fallen by an average of 50% over the past three to four years. Take Celtic Sea cod as an example. The catch limitations in 1999 would typically have been four to five tonnes per month for vessels over 55 feet in length and about two tonnes per month for vessels under that length. There is a stark contrast in 2003. The corresponding limitation is about one tonne and half a tonne respectively. Unfortunately, there has been a dramatic drop in the stocks available.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Deputy asked about consultation with the industry. Every month fishing industry representatives are involved in an advisory group which looks at the available quota over the year. There is strong opposition among the main fishing industry representative organisations to the quotas becoming anything other than a public national resource. A number of countries have a different system which, in effect, allows the quotas to become commodities which can be bought and sold by vessel owners. That is a privatisation process—</p>

          <p eId="para_200">I am aware of the report which was commissioned by the operator and major shareholder in the Seven Heads development. However, I do not propose to offer specific views on it other than to welcome it as a contribution to the levels of public knowledge and discussion on this wider issue of the economic impact of offshore exploration, development and production.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">A copy of the report was given to me at a recent meeting with a representative of the company. At the meeting I took the opportunity to impress on the company the importance attached by the Government to the overall contribution and benefit that such developments should make to the national, regional and local economy in terms of their use of local goods and services and employment. I stressed that local services and employment must be given the opportunity to compete for the range of opportunities available, from standby vessels, supply vessels, supply contracts and offshore employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">To date the industry has recognised the need to involve local industry and has supported efforts to achieve this. The Government, however, does not expect the industry to avail of Irish goods, services or employment where these are clearly uncompetitive.</p>

It appears that there will be impressive spin-offs in terms of balance of payments, the gas supply and jobs in the Cork area, and that is welcome. However, the question dealt with future developments, such as further developments at the Seven Heads field or at the Corrib field. Has the Government any intention of reviewing issues such as royalties, State participation and the expected job creation there might be in, for example, north Connacht and Mayo? A few years ago the previous Minister, former Deputy O'Rourke, in what was then the Department of Public Enterprise, set in place the gas 2025 programme with regard to the network the island might have in the future. Is the Minister thinking strategically about these matters given the welcome elements of the report from Ramco?</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Both the Minister and I are well aware of the need to encourage the employment of Irish people. I have held a round of productive meetings with Mr. Noel Dowling and SIPTU as well as with representatives of the Seven Heads company. At all times, we have expressed our concern that Irish people should be employed as much as possible. Ramco envisaged that the Seven Heads partners would directly spend at least €40 million here in the 2002-2003 period during the development phase, which will create 110 jobs. In indirect spin-offs, they will spend €10.6 million which will create a further 99 jobs. Therefore, there will be significant job creation involved as well as a spin-off effect for the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We must also bear in mind that the Kinsale gas operations were in decline. This will extend them by a further ten to 15 years and will copperfasten the existing 120 jobs in Kinsale.</p>

The development is hugely important for the Munster region and for Cork in particular. It secures the Kinsale gas field for another ten to 20 years and, therefore, the jobs of those employed there. The vast majority of the expertise involved in that operation is Irish. Is it not the case that in recent weeks Ramco has opened a new office in Cork and is making significant efforts to involve the local community by employing local people where possible? The only exception to that is where specialist equipment or skills are required that cannot be found in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">The establishment of a special fund was an important element of the package of measures agreed by the Government last December to reform and strengthen public service broadcasting in Ireland. The underlying objective of the package of measures was to ensure that radio and television services of the highest quality continue to be available to Irish audiences.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The new fund will result in additional high quality programming being offered to Irish audiences. The objective of the fund is to encourage broadcasters to innovate and offer more of the type of programming that audiences value.

In a memo dated 25 November 2002, the head of broadcasting in the Department, Mr. Ciarán Ó Hogáin, told the Minister there was a compelling case against making any of the licence fee available to privately owned broadcasting companies. Part of his argument was that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has already laid down stringent guidelines on the public service commitments of local radio stations and privately owned television stations. Was there not, therefore, already a remit for private companies? The Minister said the fund was not for foreign audiences.</p>

It is based upon a very restricted view of what this fund will be so as to ensure it is additional to whatever is being provided. The independent Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will decide on this, which will subsequently be known as the Broadcasting Authority. The fund will be for programmes that feature Irish culture, history or heritage with particular reference to the Irish language, art, local history, civics and folklore, excluding current affairs. It will also operate in respect of adult literacy.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_231">The European Commission's view, as stated on a number of occasions, is that Regulations 685/95 and 2027/95 remain in place until such time as they are replaced, repealed or found to be in breach of European law by the European Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">While the Commission has not provided a formal legal opinion, it has indicated that it takes the view that the provisions in relation to the 40vessel limit within the Irish box applied to Spain are discriminatory and may not be enforceable after 31 December 2002, when the period for Spanish accession under the accession treaty expired.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Commissioner Fischler's view is that these elements of the regulations must be revised to remove the discrimination between member states. He states that the non-discriminatory elements in these regulations – effort ceilings, hailing in and out provisions where they relate to western waters but not the Irish box – continue to be enforceable until such time as the regulations are repealed or revised. Commissioner Fischler accepts that there are differing legal opinions on the current legal position in relation to the Irish box. In this regard, I have made Ireland's legal advice, as provided by the Attorney General, available to the Commission and other member states. My advice, which is supported by the legal advice of Portugal, is clear and states that Regulations 685/95 and 2027/95 continue to be in place and have full legal effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The Commission presented a proposal in December to replace the current EU regulation in relation to the Irish box. The Commission's proposal eliminates the Irish box and the 40vessel limit at any one time for Spanish vessels. I have opposed this proposal and Ireland and other member states are continuing to discuss the proposal at official level.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_235">The position regarding this issue is confusing. The media, particularly in regard to the fishing industry, seem to have been given the impression from the Minister's Department in the past month or so that the matter was resolved, that the Commission was simply supporting us and that there would be no change. However, it appears the Minister is telling us something different today and that there appears to be an impasse. Is that the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The Minister also gave the impression on the last occasion he took questions that the Commissioner had told him to sort out the matter with his counterpart in Spain. To what extent has the Minister done this or is it his intention to negotiate some <i>modus vivendi</i> with the Spanish Government and his Spanish counterpart in order that we can have a resolution of this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I am sure the Minister will agree that the Irish Box is a crucial national resource. It gives us an opportunity to develop the type of conservation based and sustainable policies we spoke about last week with the Minister's colleague when dealing with the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. It is critical that the Minister gets his act together and tells the fishing industry, particularly the 25,000 families who depend directly on it, once and for all what is the position and that he does not mislead the media.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">He definitely did not get it from anything I said, nor did the fishing industry.

          <p eId="para_244">As the Deputy may be aware, I had a meeting arranged with Commissioner Fischler in order to press our case again. A number of other countries also have a difficulty with the proposal made by the Commission in this regard, not particularly in relation to the Irish Box but in relation to other issues that are relevant to the proposal. As far as I am concerned, I will be in there fighting our case.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">In regard to any bilateral arrangements that might be made, it is the Deputy who has changed his tune; he alleged in an earlier speech in the Dáil that a sweetheart deal was done between myself and the Spanish, but that is not the case. This issue is not something that can be solved bilaterally between Ireland and Spain because it has knock-on effects for all countries which have an interest in the Irish Box and in western waters. If there is to be any compromise on this, it must be done under the aegis of the EU Commission which should have the overall view not only on conservation but on equality among states. I will be relying on the Commission in that respect.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">Does the Minister agree that we need to consider a non-discriminatory measure which will control fishing in the Irish Box? The best non-discriminatory measure would be strict conservation measures where boats fishing outside the Irish Box would have different gear and different fishing mechanisms. If we had such strict conservation measures in the Irish Box, it would, in a strange way, discriminate in favour of Irish boats exclusively fishing in that area.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">In reply to Deputy Coveney's question, the issue he raised does not arise because, to date, the number of boats there has not exceeded that particular figure.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I will change tack now. The Minister for Defence is taking the Order of Business. It appears the Government is involved in a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth and to refuse people the right of access to information about the workings of Government and decisions made five years ago. Does the Minister for Defence agree with the analysis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, outlined in a contemptuously arrogant statement last Saturday, to the effect that the Irish electorate would not understand what he called the intellectually penetrating analysis that goes on around the Cabinet table – that people in Caherciveen, Littleton or Burtonport would not understand this and, therefore, do not deserve to know about it and should stay quiet and accept what the Government does? Surely it is in everybody's interest if Government is open and transparent and Ministers have nothing to hide, which many of them do not, and are there to serve the public and make decisions. Who cares whether the Minister, Deputy Brennan, was for or against an issue that was dealt with five years ago? We are not talking about the issues of last week or last year; we are talking about Government decisions made five years ago and Government decisions from that period onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">If the Minister for Defence does not agree with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and if everybody wants to accept views from the public and those who should be involved in this consultative process, why does the Government not allow the civil servants to attend the finance committee, why does it not allow the Information Commissioner to give his view and the various groups to give their views so that we can all have a liberal and open review of this legislation? Does the Minister for Defence agree with the analysis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Why is it that Ministers appear to be dead set on running away from opening up a Freedom of Information Act that could have prevented many of the costly tribunals that have taken place in the past few years?</p>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_265">I reject out of hand the contention that the Government is trying to hide anything. We have a Freedom of Information Act which has proved to be successful in promoting openness and accountability. It is a generous system, as far as I can ascertain, in comparison with what is operating in most democratic countries. There are few countries where a licence for opening up everything that happens at Government level is available to the public after five years. In the majority of cases, it is either 20 or 30 years and, here, it has been reduced to ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Five years ago I made proposals to the Government in relation to dealing with the hearing impairment claims in the Department of Defence. I am still the Minister for Defence and I am still dealing with these problems. Deputy Kenny will understand that many issues can continue for longer than five years.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_267">Is that not a case for moving Ministers around and making good decisions in an effective time? Does the Minister for Defence not agree that the electorate is capable of understanding what happens in Government, despite the intellectually penetrating analysis that takes place in the Dublin 4 section of the mind of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Is it not a fact that the culture of secrecy and silence has given rise to many tribunals that could have been prevented? Is it not a fact that the people know what is good for them and can understand, and that the Government is running away from that?</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Regardless of whether issues last longer than five years and are still ongoing, the people deserve to know why, for example, they cannot play their national games in a national stadium, why Eircom Park was shafted and why major tax concessions for developments were given. Why is there a cover-up? Why is the Government running away from opening up the truth to the people? The people have never been afraid of the truth. This is a case of "Animal Farm" in reverse. The Freedom of Information Act applies to everyone except those involved in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Bill should not be rammed through the Seanad using a guillotine, the Government should accept the Fine Gael amendments and open up the process in the interests of democracy. There is nothing wrong with this unless the Government has something to hide.</p>

Is this the reason the Tánaiste is running away from her responsibility to the House, because she has effectively been subsumed into single party Government? The Progressive Democrats are not acting as a watchdog when an issue such as the revision of the Freedom of Information Act can happen in a fashion designed to shut out the public and the media and limit the flow of public information.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I am aware of some tensions in relation to some provisions of the FOI Act which may be seen as unduly interfering in the process of government. However, open government and greater accountability by definition involve greater scrutiny of decision making; while this may from time to time result in embarrassment for public servants or politicians, the common good of safeguarding against wrong-doing, at whatever level, must take precedence. In any event, I am fully satisfied that the provisions of the FOI Act as they stand are more than sufficient to protect all of the essential interests of government. Nothing in the operation of FOI over the past four years . . .  suggests otherwise.</p>

People of the highest integrity examined it and made a number of recommendations. These recommendations, by any standard, are minor and moderate. All the essential provisions, the information which Deputies and media people are interested in having, is still available. By any international standards, and I would like to be judged by what happens in most other democracies and am not afraid to stand up to that test in any form, we have one of the most open and accountable systems and an excellent democracy which allows the people to make a huge contribution towards making the country as good and strong as it is.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_401">In page 11, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_402">"Increases in Tax Bands, Exemption Limits and Tax Credits</p>
          <p eId="para_403">1.–The tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits relating to income tax set out in the Finance Act 2002 are hereby increased by 7 per cent with effect from the tax year 2003.".</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The purpose of this amendment is to ask that this Government give some kind of justice and fair play to PAYE taxpayers who have had minuscule recognition in the Finance Bill and who have failed to be compensated for inflation, despite the fact that a range of price increases has been visited on working families by this Government. More than half of the rate of inflation we are currently experiencing, which is the highest in the European Union, arises from price increases, levies and charges and stealth taxes imposed by this Government on a range of charges. College registration fees have increased by €274. That is even before the reintroduction of fees as promised by the Taoiseach at the weekend, despite the partners in Government, the so-called watchdogs – the lapdogs in the Progressive Democrats – having put up posters in third level colleges stating that the Progressive Democrats will fight the reintroduction of fees. Additional prescription charges will cost an extra €200 per annum, approximately. There is an extra €78 on ESB bills and an extra €170 in VHI charges. It costs an extra €30 to tax a small family car and there has been a €69.50 increase in stamp duties on credit cards and bank cards. We have had an unceasing range of Government stealth taxes. In this amendment we are asking that a sense of fairness and justice be restored in rebalancing the tax system in favour of the PAYE sector and the ordinary worker.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I draw attention to a number of stealthy moves the Minister has made in the Bill before the House. One of those is to give more concessions to private hospitals in the form of capital allowances. This amendment was not introduced on Committee Stage where it would have been subject to detailed examination and discussion. Instead, it was sneaked in a few hours before the Bill came before the House for Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">There are also detailed amendments which again favour corporate taxation. While the Minister has talked about helping the PAYE sector, those in employment and working families, the reality is that his Finance Bill is a monument to the continued unfairness of our tax system. For instance, the closure of loopholes in relation to holiday cottages is postponed for at least two further tax years, if not longer. The closure of the loophole is postponed until people have secured planning permission. Unlike first-time buyers, people have until 31 May to lodge a planning application on their holiday cottage.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Last week the Minister argued in favour of low direct tax rates. He defends a 20% capital gains tax rate while ordinary working families are hit with probably the highest rates of indirect taxes in Europe. In this Bill he is increasing the standard rate of VAT from 12.5% to 13.5%. As a result, a range of additional price increases in areas like ESB and gas charges have been visited on ordinary families in the past month alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Let us contrast that treatment with what has happened to people in business or those who have significant earnings in excess of €0.25 million to €0.50 million. They have a loophole, which the Minister has not chosen to close, whereby they can create a company, funnel the bulk of their income into that company, close it down after a number of years of operation and create a large capital gain on which they are subject to tax at a rate of 20%. The Minister talked about the ten or 12 loopholes he would close but I told him that was the Augustinian principle – close the tax loopholes but, like St. Augustine, not just yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Some of the most glaring anomalies have not been addressed, particularly in the case of management companies into which very wealthy individuals channel their income. The biggest loopholes have been left untouched. The Minister defended the retention of the 20% rate while refusing to give even a modicum of relief to ordinary families in the PAYE sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The purpose of the Labour Party amendment is to ask that the PAYE sector be compensated by an expansion of tax credits to compensate for the increases brought about by inflation, at least half of which are driven by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The Minister's so-called crackdown on tax loopholes is a very slow process and some of the major loopholes have not been addressed by him. We continue to be a two-tier society, both in relation to education and taxation. The Labour Party's approach in this amendment is to demand a fair deal and justice for the working family and the PAYE taxpayer.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I support Deputy Burton's amendment which I supported also on Committee Stage. She has presented a cogent and sustainable argument. The same argument was presented to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, during the course of Committee Stage but the Minister, in his cold and callous disregard for those most in need, many of whom are struggling to bring up their children in dignity and with the prospects of a future that offers them the opportunity to reach their full potential, has refused to accept even one amendment presented by the collective effort of all of the Opposition finance spokespersons over three days. With all respect, the Minister's yawn says it all. In my previous experience in the area of the environment and local government, I have never seen anything quite like the Minister's obstinacy in continuing to refuse to accept the validity of the arguments presented by Deputies Burton, Richard Bruton, Boyle, myself and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Amendment No. 1 reflects the spirit of amendment No. 2 and seeks to address the crucifixion – I repeat the word "crucifixion"– of the PAYE sector by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat coalition. This must end but the only way that can happen is by addressing what has been done. To stop now would not be adequate; we need to reverse the situation but that can only be done by increasing tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits. One would expect the Minister to do that but the reality, as I have said, is that he shows scant regard for those facing the cold reality of trying to make ends meet. The Minister is happy to see corporation tax drop from 16% to 12.5% and capital gains tax is now 20%. However, there is no talk of taxing wealth or taxing on the basis of ability to pay. Most disgraceful of all, those on or below the minimum wage are still in the tax net. That is a scandalous condemnation of the Minister and Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">There is a notion that as this is the first year of the Government's term, by the time of the next general election these dark, dismal days will have been forgotten through the announcement of a series of small goodies in order to cajole the wider populace. That will not be the case as those people have been screwed repeatedly by the Government. People have demonstrated time and again that they feel cheated and that they were given false promises by the Government before last May's election. The final act has been performed not only in the Minister's introduction of the budget on 4 December but in this Bill, which confirms the worst ravages of what he announced. Much of what the Minister intends to do was not announced in his statement on budget day. I urge the House to support this amendment and the spirit it reflects. However, I have no hope of the Minister having a change of heart. What we need is a change of Minister and of Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_415">The logic of this amendment exposes what is at the heart of this numerically challenged Minister's philosophy about fooling people about the reality of their tax situations. Real tax reform would not only accept an amendment of this nature, which seeks to take high levels of inflation into account, but would also introduce indexation on a year to year basis. Just as with general Government expenditure, people understand that if they are promised a certain amount but the resulting figure turns out to be lower, even if that figure is an increase on the previous year's allocation but less than the rate of inflation, it is a cut. They understand that the opposite also holds true when it comes to tax liability. If people's tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits remain unchanged, then they realise that any increase in pay in a given year will immediately be eaten up by a tax liability that is higher overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">This is the biggest deceit in the Finance Bill, just as it was in the budget itself. The Minister used smoke and mirrors on the tax rates for the past few years and he has not dealt with the real issues of income tax reform: the levels at which people come into the tax system, the rate at which they pay the lower rate of tax and the level at which they come into the higher rate. There is also the question of what PAYE workers can write off as opposed to the general benefits enjoyed by people with higher levels of capital and who do not work directly.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">If the Minister were interested in the idea of equity he would not only accept this amendment but subsequent amendments which seek to introduce indexation to all elements of our tax code.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_418">This amendment requires a general increase of 7% to be applied to all tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits for 2003.  The cost of this measure, at €392 million in 2003 and €537 million in a full year – almost three times the full year cost under the 2003 budget income tax package – is not possible in the current economic climate. This year I have made only limited changes to the personal tax system which will have a total cost of €186 million in a full year, and are all that can be afforded in the current circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">When the resources were there we made the corresponding improvements, as the following facts confirm. The value of the personal credit increased by almost 16% in the period 2000 to end 2002, while the value of the PAYE credit, or allowance as it was then, increased by over 136% in the same period. The value of the standard rate band for a single person increased by over 29% in the same period, while the exemption limits aged 65 and over increased by over 57%. By comparison, in the same two year period, the consumer price index rose by less than 10%. The Government is committed to sustained economic growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy and maintaining full employment. Responsible fiscal policies are central to the achievement of these aims and the proposals outlined by the Deputies would be inconsistent with this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I will give some examples of what has happened since 1997. A single person on the average industrial wage as projected for 2003 will have an average tax rate of 16.6%, compared to almost 28% in 1997. I will outline some international comparisons; the most recent data available from the OECD, which is the document "Taxing Wages 2000-2001", relates to the year 2000 and, although there have been significant changes since then, in the case of a single person on the average production wage Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU. The EU average tax wedge is 42.4% while the Irish figure is 29%. Provisional data from the EU, also relating to 2000, shows that the average EU tax wedge for 2000 for a single low-paid person on 50% of the average industrial wage is 35%, while Ireland's tax wedge for that income is 14.8%. For a married couple on 50% of the average production wage, the tax wedge in Ireland is 3.8% while the EU average is 32.3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">If Deputies pick up <i>The Economist</i> this week they will see a chart on page 98 outlining economic and financial indications – it is there every week and details output, demand and jobs all over the world. This week, one chart outlines household direct tax burdens and goes through a list of countries. It states that the direct tax burden on industrial workers with a family has fallen in most countries over the past two years and that the decline has been greatest in Ireland, where an employee on an average blue collar wage, with two children, now gets more in cash benefits than he pays in direct taxes and social security contributions. Ireland is therefore the only country below the line on the chart, in that it is the country where the average blue collar worker with two children gets more in cash benefits than he pays in direct taxes and social security benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The election was held on 18 May and the people liked the approach the Government has taken to taxation. Deputy Ó Caoláin will have to update his script. He is talking about another age when he speaks of the crucifixion of the PAYE sector. Not even Deputy Burton refers to that anymore. Whatever justification there was for saying that before 1997, the main criticism of my tenure as Minister has been the opposite, that we have done too much to reduce the tax burden at the expense of other areas. The Deputy's script factory reflects another era.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">This amendment asks the Government to live up to its election promises and take the action in the Finance Bill that would remove those on the minimum wage from the tax net. It has been promised by the Government. The Minister was just talking about how well people have done from his successive budgets but the fact remains that people on very low incomes are still paying significant amounts of tax. I will contrast that situation with the evidence available from a parliamentary question I put down to the Minister and the relevant supplementary papers which I was able to access under the Freedom of Information Act – a facility which will not be available very much longer unless the Minister reconsiders his position and adopts the Labour Party's proposal for a one year cooling off period. With regard to the example quoted by the Minister a few moments ago in relation to Duncan, Mary and their two children, the study by the Revenue Commissioners on effective tax rates for high earning individuals, showed that, of 400 top earners, the effective tax rate had fallen to 16.5%—</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_442">—to 15.5% from a much higher rate in 1999. The officials of the Revenue Commissioners who produced the study on effective tax rates for high earning individuals found that 18% of the highest earning individuals in the year 1999-2000 had an effective tax rate of 15% – the same rate which, some years later, has become applicable to Duncan and Mary. The information available from the Revenue Commissioners' study, limited though it may be, shows that, through tax loopholes and avoidance methods – many of them property-based and only due to be closed several years hence – 117 of the 400 individuals concerned had an effective tax rate of 30% in 1999-2000. One quarter of those 400 people paid no tax at all, usually because of property based tax avoidance schemes available with Government approval and 54%, or more than 200 of them paid less than 10% of their income in tax. That is the dilemma which faces society in creating a fair tax system for people in the PAYE sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">As I have said on previous occasions, I welcome the reduction in high marginal rates of income tax and I hope we can maintain that. However, we can only do so if everybody pays his fair share and people at the lowest level of income, on the minimum wage, are taken out of the tax net completely. Although the Minister has certainly brought down PAYE tax rates from the high marginal level – and I agree with that – he has not closed down the loopholes available to the very wealthy, such as the 400 we have been discussing just now. As accountants, the Minister and I know that in the case of a client with an income of about €500,000, either of us could design a scheme to reduce that individual's tax liability to a very low level by using a device such as a management company or the property reliefs and loopholes which the Minister has left open. That favouritism of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil – the Progressive Democrats in particular – towards the very wealthy is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">We will not achieve acceptance that everybody is paying his fair share unless the Minister can show that those in the category of the 400 people to whom the Revenue Commissioners' survey referred are paying their fair share. The scandalous situation whereby some of that group pay no tax must be brought to an end – not in two years time but now – and people on the minimum wage must be taken out of the tax net. Those are essential requirements in any just, equitable and fair taxation policy but, unfortunately, they are absent from this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">I support the case made by Deputy Burton in relation to this amendment. As she has pointed out, a significant percentage of the highest earners in this jurisdiction pay no tax at all. That fact alone demands that the core objective of the amendment must be addressed, namely the removal from the tax bracket of those on or below the minimum wage. The Minister mentioned a figure of 10% in relation to people on less than the minimum wage. In reality, the percentage could be much higher. Although 90% of those on the minimum wage are outside of the tax net, there could be much more than 10% of those on or below the minimum wage who are still caught in that bracket. It is a significant percentage. It will make a critical difference to people who most need the support of the Minister and the Government in trying to cope with the demands they are facing in society at present. It is scandalous that people at that level of income are still in the tax net, having regard to the disgraceful situation <i>vis-à-vis </i>those among the highest earners in the land who do not pay. No further comment is necessary on this self-sustaining argument. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment, recognising that he has failed to do what he should have done earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">The figures quoted by the Minister in relation to Duncan and Mary were very interesting. Apparently, Duncan and Mary were earning €40,000 in 1997 and €40,000 in 2002. That does not say very much for their upward mobility. He also failed to take into account that the cumulative effect of inflation, even over that five year period, was at least 15%. Even if one takes it at a cumulative 2% per year, that amounts to 12% or 13%. Accordingly, the value of the original €40,000 in 1997 is down by €6,500, which is less than the tax the Minister has given back to them over that period. That is a critical argument in terms of indexation. The Minister is paying people with their own futures and is really not giving them any additional money.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I turn to the specific amendment, in the context of the minimum wage. The Minister stated that the cost of implementing this would be in the region of €500 million in a year. Coincidentally, that is the sum he is prepared to give to people who have invested in the special savings investment account scheme, which is benefiting people with disposable income. That is something which people on the minimum wage most decidedly do not enjoy. In order to get any benefit from the SSIA scheme, a person on the minimum wage would have to invest up to 25% of his or her income of no more than €225 per week. Those are the balances which the Minister has put into the system and for which he must be held to account. It is disconcerting that he has not taken this opportunity to remove everybody on the minimum wage from the tax system. It is an anachronism that the State, through family income supplement, provides some form of supplementary income for people who find themselves in that situation. In reality, that is not a supplementary income for people on low wages. It is a subsidy for employers who wish to pay low wages. There are numerous inconsistencies and inequities in the system which the Minister had an opportunity to address in the budget and in this Finance Bill, but he has chosen not to. The arguments he made today, on Committee Stage and indeed on Second Stage are inconsistent and do not address the reality of many people in society forced to live on the minimum wage.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_317" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_452">As I pointed out during the Committee Stage debate on this issue, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Burton for a number of reasons which I will reiterate.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The Government's approach to exempting the minimum wage from tax is already well established. We stated in An Agreed Programme for Government that the objective is to be achieved as a priority over the next five years subject, of course, to the overarching requirement for sound economic and fiscal policies and for keeping the public finances in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">In 2002, we achieved a position where 90% of the minimum wage annualised was exempt from tax and we have maintained that position in 2003 with limited resources even though the wage increased again towards the end of 2002. In 2003 workers earning at or below an annualised figure of €11,600 –€223 per week – will pay no tax. I might add that, thanks to the increases I have provided for in personal credits, a single person on the average industrial wage has benefited to the tune of €39 per week due to tax changes alone in the period 1997 to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">As I mentioned during the Committee Stage debate, I would not favour the approach suggested by the Deputy for exempting the minimum wage from taxation, that is, the use of the general exemption limits. Such an approach would be complex to implement, not only for the Government but also for employers because of the large numbers of people – almost 100,000 – who would be brought into the system of marginal relief. In addition, it would run contrary to the thrust of Government policy over recent years. This stems from the recommendations of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare code with which Deputy Burton is very familiar and which was to move away from use of the general exemption limits as a means to remove lower paid individuals from the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I might remind the Deputy about the scale of the costs involved in exempting those on minimum wage through the preferred route of increasing the personal tax credits. To complete the process using an increase in the personal credit alone would cost about €420 million in a full year. To achieve the same result through an increase in the PAYE credit alone would cost about €286 million in a full year and to do so using equal increases in the personal and PAYE credits would cost about €353 million in a full year. Having regard to the scale of these costs, the Government will address the issue over the full period of its present term of office. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_457">I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. Notwithstanding the points he made about technical difficulties of implementation, we cannot have public confidence in the tax system until we have parity of treatment for different classes of people. The reality is that very low paid people are in the tax net, including people on or near the minimum wage. As I said, the study carried out by officials in the Revenue Commissioners shows clearly that 400 of the highest earning individuals were paying rates of tax which were exceptionally low. Half of them were paying nothing and 54% were paying a rate of less than 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">My point is that such unfair disparity in treatment between the very low paid who are in the tax net and very wealthy individuals who are out of the tax net altogether is not sustainable. The Minister should bear in mind that those in the Revenue Commissioners' study were people in the tax system. We are not even talking about the people with foreign residency for tax purposes who can still manage to drop in for every race meeting, opera opening etc., 30 or 40 times a year as they choose, and who pay little or no tax in this country. We are not talking about the stallion owners because they will not be required for another two years to even fill in a tax return on their income. We are talking here about very high income individuals in the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Minister, an innovative accountant, and I could sit down and, between us, on one sheet of paper set out how very high earners with income of more than €500,000 could shield about half of that from tax through the existing loopholes. That contrasts with the situation for very low income earners.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">The Minister, in his concluding remarks, stated: "In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment". I could not note his reason. The Minister quoted figures of X millions for the cost of the measure. For what reason can the Minister ignore the daily living conditions of people struggling in poverty? He gave no reason for not adopting this amendment. He quoted the figure in terms of its effect, but he is not examining the reality of the effect of his failure to act on ordinary families in society. He is only measuring it on one hand and is not looking at it on the other, which is a story as starkly different from his own that he would not believe it.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">It is a fact that families are living in poverty. Those who are existing on the minimum wage, and providing for children, in particular, are living in poverty in this day and age. It is to the children of these low earners the Society of St. Vincent de Paul referred in its pre-Christmas report which described children going to school under-nourished and ill-clothed. Those are children in our society today. These are the families for whom this amendment offers hope. It offers the prospect of improved financial resources, improved family circumstances and a better prospect of reaching a better standard of living within their communities.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_462">As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the idea of a minimum wage came from the Fianna Fáil Party. We incorporated it into our policy platform for the 1997 election and set about putting it into effect when we got into Government with the Progressive Democrats. Exempting the minimum wage from taxation was not part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1997. It became part of the review of the programme carried out half way through the period of that Government and became an objective at that stage, one which was carried over into the PPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Regarding the minimum wage, some 681,030 income earners or 36.12% of all income earners will be outside the tax net post-budget. In 1998, before my first budget, that figure was 25% of income earners or approximately 380,000 people. This illustrates the progress that has been made for those on lower pay. As a recent study highlighted in Irish newspapers has shown, we have the best, most effective and lowest tax burden on low income earners of all EU countries and, as far as I know, of nearly all the OECD countries as well. I am sure Deputy Ó Caoláin will be familiar with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Deputy Burton referred again to the Revenue Commissioners' recent 2002 study on the effective tax rates of high income earners, but the study indicates an increase in the effective rate of high earners in 1999-2000 compared with the findings of a similar study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 1997 on the effective tax rates of high earners in the tax years 1993-94 and 1994-95, a copy of which I placed in the Library on 26 February 1998. The more recent study was placed in the Library on 11 December 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">In part, that change occurred as a result of changes I made in the Finance Act 1998, when I restricted the use of capital allowances on buildings and made many other changes in that regard. Some of the changes I have made since had a further effect and, in this budget, I have done even more.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">I thank the Minister for his reply. It is an absolute disgrace that in this new century there is still a tax burden on families on minimum wage or just above it. The Minister should bear in mind that those families are facing all the price increases, charges and stealth taxes we talked about earlier. At the same time, 400 of the most wealthy people in society are paying little or no tax. By any interpretation, that is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I noted carefully what the Minister said. He has not indicated that those on extremely high incomes will pay higher effective tax rates at any serious level in the foreseeable future. As the Minister knows, most of his loophole closures are being postponed for at least two years. Welcome as the restrictions on these loopholes are, the result is that the lower income earners get little or nothing while the high earners get lots of time to ease into contributing tax at the same rate as the average working family.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_476">In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_477">"2.–Section 15 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_478">‘(3) The amounts specified in column (1) of this table shall be automatically increased for each year of assessment by a percentage equal to the annualised rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index last published by the Central Statistics Office before the commencement of the year of assessment.'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The purpose of these amendments is to reintroduce the basic concept, which should be present in a tax code, of indexation of thresholds and credits. It is extraordinary that after so many years of economic success, the Minister cannot even give indexation to people on the most basic credits and allowances to ensure the ravages of increased costs of living do not erode their living standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In the course of this debate, I have listened to the Minister's self-congratulatory tone as he puffed out his chest and said what a wonderful fellow he was for having reduced taxes on various bodies over the last five years. However, the reason we are debating indexation is that, for the last two years, the Minister increased spending by 40%, but increased tax by just 6%. He increased spending at seven times the rate of growth of tax revenue and brought the public finances to a state where severe cuts and stealth taxes had to be imposed so that people dependent on the most basic tax allowances cannot get indexation. Not providing for indexation means the Minister is putting his hand in the pocket of the average family and taking €400 from them over the course of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Minister should be coming here crestfallen. Perhaps we should have some humility from the Minister in advance of tomorrow, given it is Ash Wednesday. He went to the country last year, telling us that hospital waiting lists would be abolished in two years, that first-time buyers would be protected from unfair competition from investors, that another 200,000 people would have a medical card, that another 2,000 gardaí would be walking the streets ensuring people were not subject to violent attack, and that consumers would be protected from rip-offs during the euro changeover. All of these promises, which were at the heart of the last election, have gone up in smoke. On the last amendment, we quibbled about the pennies that should be made available to people at the bottom of the scale and now the Minister is saying that indexation cannot be provided. The Minister has moved from having a strong economy in which revenues were strong to one in which revenues are about one third of what he predicted. Already this year, income tax is falling short of what the Minister predicted. The Minister should be telling us how he proposes to manage the economy to ensure that decent services can be provided for those who depend on public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The reality in my constituency is very far removed from the lavish promises contained in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. Today I learned of the closure of a crèche in Darndale, one of the most disadvantaged areas of my constituency, for want of funding. Nursing home subventions are being cut and the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital is in continual chaos. I met a person at my clinic recently that spent five days on a trolley in Beaumont Hospital waiting to be attended. Essential repair grants and supports for people at the bottom of the scale have also been cut back.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">There is an air of unreality about the Minister's self-congratulatory tone. The Minister has mismanaged public spending in recent years and we are seeing the cruel consequences of short-sighted cutbacks. The Minister has maintained the entire State bureaucracy. Public pay will be increased by almost 12% this year while the non-pay element of his spending, when ruling out social welfare, will be increased by 1.5%. This means beds and crèches will close, nursing home grants will be cut and the little things that make life possible and decent for those who depend on public services have been axed. That is the reality of the Finance Bill we are debating and it is time the Minister cottoned on to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">He tells us the electorate made its decision. If one cares to ask the electorate today, it will say what it thinks of the decision it made. The electorate believes it was conned and having been conned, Ministers are now going to bury the evidence by changing access under the Freedom of Information Act. The Government exudes a great whiff of arrogance for which it will ultimately pay dearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The Minister is deciding that inflation will be the force that rescues the public finances. As Deputy Burton has already spelled out, there have been increases at every turn. While pensioners received an additional €10 per week to their pensions, medication charges paid by them increased by €7 per week. Increases have also been introduced for casualty charges, motor tax, diesel, VHI contributions, bus fares, gas costs and college registration fees. We now hear that college fees are to be reintroduced through a loan scheme. Every day the Minister is finding new ways to increase the cost of living for people who are struggling to get by. He is using inflation as the tool to rescue him from the financial problems he has created. He is taking €400 by stealth from every household.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The trouble is not that people are being cheated; the consequences are very serious. Manufacturing prices have fallen by 4% in the last nine months. Those trying to compete in the trading economy are seeing the price they can get for their goods and services falling sharply. The pressure the Minister has created through these stealth taxes means that people are rightly looking for pay increases to compensate for this. Business people are seeing their energy and transport costs increase and this will result in the loss of jobs. It has been little remarked on that in the last two years one in five IDA or Enterprise Ireland created jobs were lost. This is a dramatic meltdown and much more rapid than anything we have seen for at least a decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Many companies are close to the brink and we cannot afford this inflationary management of the public finances and short-sighted approach to public spending. A proper programme of reform in public spending should be introduced that looks at the delivery of health and education services in a radical way. The Minister has the right instincts but he has not been able to have other Ministers address this. He sat on his hands while Ministers increased spending without reforming the delivery mechanisms. Unfortunately, that is the legacy of the previous Government and we will pay dearly for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">This Bill is built on a hoax. People have been let down by it and the least we can do is make the provision that I have suggested in my amendment. It will provide that people on ordinary tax credits and allowances would see them indexed to take account of the cost of living.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_324" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_489">The Deputy is proposing the indexation of bands of certain tax credits. As I said on Committee Stage, such a move would be very costly. For example, if a figure of 4.6%, representing the best available estimate of the rate of growth in the CPI for 2002 over 2001 was to be assumed, the full year cost of indexing the standard rate band would be about €192 million. In addition, a similar increase in the main personal credits and allowances would cost about €165 million in a full year. Overall, at such a rate of annual increase, costs of almost €363 million per annum could be expected to arise. Clearly, tax expenditure on such a scale would severely limit the Government's flexibility in determining budgetary priorities having regard to the economic realities in any given year.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">It is important that the Government retains flexibility as to the size of the personal income tax package as against other priorities and the composition of any package. In this year's budget, reflected in the Finance Bill, the employee credit is being increased by 21% to ensure, given the limited resources available, 90% of the increased minimum wage is exempt from taxation even though it was increased in October 2002 and now stands at €6.35 per hour. It would be more difficult to target resources in this way if limited resources were spread equally across all bands and credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The overriding aims of the Government's budgetary and economic policy, as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government, are clear. It is committed to sustaining economic growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy and maintaining full employment. Responsible fiscal policies are central to the achievement of these aims and it is not clear that making statutory provision for the indexation of bands and credits would be consistent with this approach. For a single worker on the average wage, Ireland has the lowest tax rate in the EU and the tax burden is much lighter for the ordinary taxpayer than it is for our closest neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I remind Deputies of the fundamental changes in the tax system in recent years. Tax credits have been introduced and increased, tax rates have been substantially reduced and the standard rate band has been significantly widened. All of these make the tax system inherently fairer and all taxpayers have benefited from these measures. The Government has clear policy priorities for its term of office regarding personal taxation. This includes the removal of all those on the minimum wage from the tax net and ensuring that 80% of all earners pay tax only at the standard rate. The achievement of these aims is subject to the overarching requirement for sound economic and fiscal policies and for keeping the public finances in order.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">"3.–Section 446A of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (2) by the substitution of ‘€1,540' for ‘€770'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The purpose of this amendment is to double the home carer's allowance. Members will recall that when individualisation was first introduced by the Minister and the position of two earner couples was made considerably more attractive than that of one earner couples there was some unease, not least among Fianna Fáil backbenchers, that this would bear heavily on those who choose to stay at home to look after children or a person who requires long-term care. This element of tax relief was introduced as an afterthought to that budget. Since then it has remained frozen at its original level and this is an opportunity to increase it. Increasingly, pressures are coming on families in relation to caring both for their children and for older and infirm people in the home. We need to give recognition to people who decide to take on those significant burdens.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The only provision now afforded in the tax code is where somebody employs a person to carry out these home caring responsibilities for a disabled person. However, if a family member chooses to do it, there is no commensurate recognition other than the small €770 allowance. I am advocating that this be increased to €1,540. It would be a significant gesture. That is not to say there is some superiority about the choice of people who decide to stay at home over the choice to go out to work. However, we should not so tilt the balance that the choice of those who decide to stay at home is severely penalised. The maximum penalty for the stay at home spouse some years ago, when the Minister started individualisation, was €330. Under successive budgets the maximum penalty has increased to €4,200. It has gone too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">We need more sensible recognition of the pressures on families. That should be a general principle in the tax code. The Minister in his budgets has been too narrowly focused on the needs of the economic engine to have people to serve it rather than looking at the pressures on families at different stages of their life cycle, whether it be the period when they must support child care, the period when they guide their children through college or the period when they are taking care of elderly relatives. The tax code should include more recognition of those burdens, as should labour law.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The Minister's preference for Boston rather than Berlin means this type of thinking is generally hostile to the thinking in Boston, although Boston is probably the most European of American cities. It is certainly hostile to the thinking in Los Angeles with its rugged economy and where the needs of the economy rule above all. A different approach is needed to family responsibilities in labour law and the tax code in terms of the supports available to people. This amendment is just a small element of the reforming approach we ought to introduce in our tax, welfare and labour regimes.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_501">The Minister indicated on Committee Stage, during the debate on this amendment, that its full cost in a full year would be approximately €100 million. It is a substantial cost to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I wish to focus on people who are full time in the home and have specific caring duties in respect of handicapped children or elderly or infirm relatives. They are in a particularly difficult and onerous situation. If the children or adults with a disability were in a State institution or if the elderly or infirm relatives were in a nursing home, the cost to the State would be far greater. I am disappointed that there has been no additional provision in the Finance Bill for such needy situations. Due to the reduction in finances available to the Government, nothing substantial has been done for carers in either the social welfare legislation or in this Bill. I urge the Minister to reconsider and perhaps target this relief to those who have specific caring responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Caring for children with a disability or for infirm elderly relatives is an onerous responsibility. The carers get little or nothing in the Social Welfare Bill or in the Finance Bill. Every week Members meet individuals who have just had a child born with significant disabilities and who will require lifelong care. One or both parents are working and they make a decision that one of the parents will either significantly curtail or, in many instances, give up work to become a full-time carer. They are shocked to discover that they can get little or nothing due to the means test rules which apply to carer's allowance. They are even more shocked when they find out that when one of the spouses gives up working, their income tax situation will disimprove dramatically as a result of the push in previous years to encourage more women into the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">This element of the tax code has become increasingly unfair while the carer's allowance is severely means tested under social welfare rules. I would have expected more ingenuity from the Minister on this issue. He indicated on Committee Stage that the cost of the relief proposed in the amendment would be €100 million and €163 million in a full year. However, the amendment has great merit. A targeted improvement for people at home who have specific caring responsibilities would be even more welcome.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_505">I support the amendment. The case regarding the needs of those who offer caring support in our society has been well made time and again in the House. The Minister has heard the arguments of Opposition Deputies through a succession of budgets and debates on Finance Bills in the past six years. Here is a simple action the Minister could take to improve the situation of, and make a gesture to, a sector of the community which provides critical support which increasing numbers of people require. When one sees the costs of supports such as nursing home subventions, it is not only desirable but there will also be a greater need of care being offered in the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">This amendment, which seeks to double the allowance, is just a small measure, despite its effect across the board. It will only offer minor relief to some of the most wonderful people in society, those who offer care and support in the home to those who need it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_507">I support the amendment. The sum involved is €100 million but let us compare it to other areas of spending. It is only one fifth of what the Minister is putting aside for special savings investment accounts, one tenth of what has already been lost in the national pension reserve fund and an infinitesimal amount of what has been overspent by the National Roads Authority in implementing national development plan projects. The Minister should be showing more foresight in those areas. This should be seen against the modest increase in the respite care grant that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs provided for in the Social Welfare Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">If the Government wants to send out a clear signal on where it stands in relation to carers, it should have introduced a combination of measures. Lack of action on this issue sends out a message that the Government does not care enough.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_330" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_509">This amendment proposes to double the home carer's tax credit from €770 to €1,540. It is estimated that to increase the home carer's credit as proposed would cost in the order of €72 million in the first year and €103 million in the full year. Given the resources available to me in budget 2003, I made only a limited number of changes in the personal tax system with a total cost of €126 million in a full year. Apart from the increase in the employee tax credit, which is designed to ensure that 90% of the minimum wage would continue to be exempt from tax, there were no increases in the generality of personal tax credits, nor in the standard rate band; the budgetary position would simply not allow for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">As Deputies will appreciate, I will not accept this amendment. The name given to this allowance – the home carer's tax credit – has allowed Deputies to speak about carers generally. However, the original purpose of the credit is as set out by Deputy Richard Bruton. He will recall that when I proceeded to widen the standard band, in the first year I had to bring forward an allowance which became known as the home carer's tax credit. I am sure the Deputy will have noted in the Fianna Fáil tax document that I addressed that problem before the 1997 general election. I promised that if we were to widen the standard rate band we would introduce a home allowance of £2,000 at the standard rate. I widened the standard rate band in that famous budget which became known for that unfortunate term "individualisation". I probably should not have used that term because the individualisation tax code is completely different from widening the standard rate band. Be that as it may, however, I brought forward that allowance which had been promised in the manifesto and it converted into a €3,000 allowance at the then standard rate of 22%, even though we had not fully introduced tax credits in that budget. It was part of the Fianna Fáil tax document, which I am sure the Deputy studied before the 1997 election, and we introduced it.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">This debate has spilled over into the whole area of caring, although that was not the initial purpose of the relief – it was a counterbalance to widening the standard rate band. Significant changes to the carer's allowance were made by successive Ministers for Social Welfare. I do not think, however, that this relief is the appropriate mechanism by which to deal with the problems about caring that speakers have raised. Deputy Burton referred to many instances involving newly-born children, and she quoted chapter and verse about that. In my extended family there was such an occurrence in the past year, in very difficult circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I know the circumstances very well but I do not think this tax credit – even though it is called a home carer's tax credit – should be associated with that element of social policy. The tax credit for handicapped children has increased from €408 to €500 per annum. In the second last Finance Bill I increased the incapacitated person's allowance up to €30,000 in order to take on people.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">It is the aim of Government policy, and that of the social partners now, to widen the standard rate band. It is currently €29,000 and I have not been in a position to change it in this Finance Bill, but it is the goal to do so over time. There was tremendous opposition to it when it was first introduced. In the following two Finance Bills I increased it steadily by widening the standard rate band. There was some opposition in my party, a great deal of opposition from the Fine Gael benches and, strangely enough, much opposition from the Labour Party. I have, however, detected a shift in emphasis by Deputy Burton, not with regard to this amendment but with regard to Labour Party policy on this matter. She reiterated today that she is in favour of lowering tax rates, which is a step away from the position adopted by her predecessor. As the new party spokesperson on finance, she is perfectly entitled to change the policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Unfortunately, my friend of long standing, Deputy Burton, was not in the House from 1997 to 2002, but I would like to know what her views are on widening the standard rate band. I would be very surprised if she was not in favour of it, as nearly all trade unionists from time immemorial have been. People such as the equality officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have always been in favour of it. In the middle of all the angst at that time, that person issued a statement supporting the idea, even though she would have been totally opposed to my political views then, as now. At the time, I readily appreciated the fact that she was not afraid to come out and say what she did on behalf of the ICTU.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">The Minister has been extremely selective in his quotation of facts surrounding this amendment. I know of no other recognition in the tax code for people who are caring for the infirm. In fact, the only recognition in respect of the social welfare code is rigorously means tested. Furthermore, if one happens to have a pension one will not receive a carer's allowance. I have not thumbed through Fianna Fáil's manifesto of late, but its provisions for carers seem to be extraordinarily mean and it appears that it cannot come up with better ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The Minister is right in saying this came about as a result of individualisation but he is not correct in suggesting, as he did, that the tax bands cannot be widened without introducing individualisation. That was a conscious choice by him to add on to the expansion of the tax band. This is a different issue but at the time the Minister's colleagues realised he had gone too far. I do not detect any indication from his reaction as to how he now views this provision going forward. Is this to be frozen as a relic of a rather difficult budget when he had to produce a sop to his backbenchers, or does he believe it has a long-term role in the tax code? I would like to hear his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">We should recognise people who choose to care in the home for whatever reasons and their work should be recognised for tax purposes. We should make it easier for people to move in and out of work, obtain support for child care while they are at work, and have time off. Generally, we should have a more supportive code of welfare, labour and social supports but the Minister does not seem to have indicated any interest in that area. His narrow concentration on the issue of individualisation misses the wider point of what we are trying to achieve for responsible people who are rearing children and looking after their extended families. This issue is part of a wider debate and I am disappointed that the Minister has narrowed the focus by recycling the history of past budgets.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">The Minister said this would cost €100 million in a full year. Can we focus on those who are providing care for children with an intellectual or physical disability, or caring in the home for an elderly, infirm relative? If even half that amount, €50 million, was spent – which is about 75% of the cost of one of the Government jets – it would be a significant step towards helping such people. The Minister has acknowledged it himself. We all regularly come across cases where someone has a child with a specific disability and if both parents have been working, their entire financial structure is completely upended. Not only does one spouse have to give up work to look after the child with special needs, but they are hammered also by the tax code. I am sure the Minister would be the first to acknowledge that the specific allowances available in respect of children with a physical or intellectual disability are relatively low. I am sure he would be generous enough to acknowledge that. He might say this is an issue that all parties must address. However, there is an opportunity in this Bill to build on a measure which had an awkward birth. Saturday is International Women's Day. I will ask some of the people to whom the Minister referred what are their views on this issue and I will report back to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I offer the Minister a constructive and positive approach and support what Deputy Bruton has said and put forward in his amendment in order to target a particular group of carers in the home. These carers usually do not qualify under a means test for any sort of State support but nevertheless wish to look after their children or elderly relatives at home, and some carers are often devastated in the aftermath of a trauma such as a child being born with very special needs. I expect the Minister to be a little bit more ingenious and to offer something special.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">This amendment proposes to increase further the annual value of the employee tax credit from the €800 proposed in section 3 to €1,000. The Deputy's proposal would cost an additional €172 million in 2003 and an additional €221 million in a full year on top of the costs already arising for the level of increase already provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The increase already provided for maintains in 2003 the position achieved after budget 2002 where 90% of the minimum wage annualised was made exempt from taxation. This takes account of an increase in the minimum wage in October 2002. It provides for an increase in the entry point to the tax system for a single worker from €209 per week to €223 per week. I considered that this was appropriate in the context of the resources available to me in this year's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">In the debate on the earlier amendments, I referred to the changes made over almost the past six years in the tax code. The accusation that I skew the tax code in particular areas to benefit the rich has been stridently leveled against me on Committee Stage, to a lesser extent on Report Stage and particularly over the previous five years. I have refuted that accusation time and again, quoted chapter and verse and my assertion that this accusation is not correct has now been backed up by OECD reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I am indebted to a Fianna Fáil backbench colleague who passed me a letter from T. Davies. I assume this person is a man, although that may not be the case. This person is Professor of Accounting and Chair of the University of Dakota. This person wrote a letter about how taxes work in response to those complaining that Bush's tax reductions only favour the rich. It struck a chord with me, having regard to my position on taxation. The letter reads:</p>
          <p eId="para_536">They understand this stuff in South Dakota. Shouldn't they be able to understand it in Washington D.C.?</p>
          <p eId="para_537">A straightforward look at taxes from an Accounting Professor at The University of South Dakota:</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this: the first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing; the fifth would pay $1; the sixth would pay $3; the seventh $7; the eighth $12; the ninth $18; the tenth man (the richest) would pay $59. That's what they decided to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement until one day, the owner threw them a curve (in tax language a tax cut). "Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20." So now dinner for the ten only cost $80.00.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six, the paying customers? How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his "fair share?"</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man (who was paying $1) and the sixth man (who was paying $3) would end up being PAID to eat their meal.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">So the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay. And so the fifth man paid nothing; the sixth pitched in $2; the seventh paid $5; the eighth paid $9; the ninth paid $12; leaving the tenth man with a bill of $52 instead of his earlier $59.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. "I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man, but he, (pointing to the tenth) got $7!". "Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man, "I only saved a dollar too . . .  it's unfair that he got seven times more than me!". "That's true!" shouted the seventh man, "Why should he get $7 back when I got only $2?.""The wealthy get all the breaks!". "Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison, "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"</p>
          <p eId="para_545">So, the nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered a little late what was very important. They were FIFTY-TWO DOLLARS short of paying the bill! Imagine that!</p>
          <p eId="para_546">And that, boys and girls, journalists and college instructors, is how the tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy and they just may not show up at the table anymore. Where would that leave the rest? Unfortunately, most taxing authorities anywhere cannot seem to grasp this rather straight-forward logic!</p>

          <p eId="para_557">I will take the example of 500 taxpayers who go out to dinner. This is like the little pigs going to market. Some 400 of these pay tax. They are very well-off taxpayers in this economy who not only can go out to dinner occasionally, they can do so every night. This is based on the Minister's officials' figures. We had better call over T. Davies because I wonder what he would think. Of the 400 little pigs who go out to dinner, 117 pay less than 30% of their income in tax, one quarter do not pay any tax, and 54% pay less than 10% tax. How would T. Davies see that?</p>
          <p eId="para_558">There is another 100 outside the 400. Let us say that 20 of these are stallion owners. Not only do they not pay tax, they do not even have to make a tax return. Let us say a few are promoters of private hospitals. The Minister has rushed in an amendment to ensure they can enjoy a bigger and better dinner in future because they will get a better deal on capital allowances. Let us say a few are individuals who are in high profile jobs that earn them a great deal of money, perhaps €500,000 a year in income. They are able to establish a small management company or companies. As a consequence of that, their effective rate of taxation will be somewhere between 10% and 12%, should they choose to pay tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">While the people eating in McDonald's or wherever in South Dakota paid some tax, I am concerned about the 500 diners in this country going out to fancy restaurants who pay little or no tax. I will contact T. Davies and he will explain that to me and the Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_577">This amendment seeks to exempt from income tax various types of compensation payments made to employees under the list of provisions in respect of discrimination, harassment, etc. There has been some discussion recently regarding the tax treatment of equality awards. In a recent article in <i>Irish Tax Review</i> it was incorrectly suggested that the Revenue Commissioners had changed their position and were proposing to tax these awards. I am assured there has been no change in their view of the tax treatment of such awards. I understand they have always held the view that general awards of this nature are taxable under the Tax Acts. This is in line with case law where the courts have consistently ruled that anything received from being, having been, or becoming an employee is taxable under schedule E as part of the remuneration of the office of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The amendment proposes the exemption of awards unless the relevant authority – for example, a tribunal, rights commission, Labour Court or a judge – declares them to be taxable. This would effectively mean that such an authority would have absolute discretion, without any objective criterion, in deciding whether the payments were taxable. I could not accept this procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I indicated on Committee Stage that I am not convinced that the awards in question should not be taxable. I can see the argument for exemption in some cases, but certain difficulties are involved. Any exemption would have to be considered in the context of the nature of the payment of those awards. Many are settled out of court and often involve a global sum in full and final settlement of all actions. The element of the award related to harassment, etc., would have to be isolated from any other compensation element, for example, loss of normal remuneration or earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">As I indicated on Committee Stage, I am willing to give further consideration to this matter. I will ask my officials and the Revenue Commissioners to examine the matter in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">In page 26, line 47, to delete "€8,000" and substitute "€9,000".</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I am sure the House will agree that, over the past two budgets, one group that has drawn the short straw has been first time house buyers. The House will recall that, in the previous budget, the Minister reversed the stamp duty provisions for investors so that they received a substantial concession, probably about €12,000, on the purchase of a standard house. Full interest relief at the 42% rate was also restored to them with no ceilings or thresholds. Generous concessions were given to investors in the 2002 budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Having read the Fianna Fáil manifesto which explicitly stated that the party would take measures to ensure that first time house buyers would not be squeezed out by investors, people looked to the 2003 budget with some hope that first time buyers would see some relief. On the contrary, they were victimised. Not only was their grant of €3,810 withdrawn, a 1% VAT increase was imposed without any transitional arrangement. On the day of the budget even though contracts were signed, this was payable whereas elsewhere in the Finance Bill we see very generous transition concessions given to people buying holiday homes, not homes for their own primary residence. A niggardly concession of €330 over a few years was made to offset a cost of about €6,000 imposed on first time house buyers in the budget. That was a bad bit of work and reflects a very strange approach to the housing market by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">On Committee Stage, he told us this happened as a result of pressure from others who were advising him to adopt it and that it was against his better instincts. It is a pity he did not pursue his instincts. In the past two years we have seen the investors given a free ride back into the marketplace and first time buyers heavily penalised. It is not producing a healthy housing market. We need to achieve equity and address the whole issue of supply in the housing market and in proposing this amendment I am going a small way to trying to give back to first time buyers a more generous concession in the first seven years of their mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I welcome the allocation of the relief over a seven year period rather than in an up front lump sum, which was easily grabbed by the builders during a strong sellers' market. That element would have been good if it was a straight switch of a grant into a tax based subsidy over a number of years, but that has not happened. There are very severe problems. People from my constituency are going to places like Carlow, Navan and Mullingar to live. They are entirely separated from their families. Issues of child care and baby-sitting are acute, as are the commuting problems. The Minister's approach, based on the Bacon reports, of remote manipulation of the price signals – or whatever they thought they were doing – is entirely counterproductive to providing a decent housing environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I would like to have seen a much more hands-on policy, a much more traditional policy of building public housing and making provision for those who could not afford houses and pushing radically the affordable housing scheme. In the city of Dublin, I believe only 20 affordable houses have been built four years after the initiative was introduced. The housing policy we have had to endure in recent years is pathetic. People in traditional income segments who expected to buy their own homes find they cannot do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">This was a bad bit of work in this budget, but it is not the whole problem. Reversing this, as I propose here, would not resolve the problems with the housing policy, but as the key economic Minister, the Minister needs to take a much more serious look at housing than he has in the past. It is all about supply and he needs to develop policies that drive supply. He and his colleagues have not been doing that and the consequences are there for all to see. We may now see prices stabilise, but solely because job creation has ceased, which is the worst way to bring such stability. A more enlightened policy by Government could have addressed this issue.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_601">On Committee Stage I made it clear that my objection to what the Minister did to first time house buyers was particularly focused on the issue of unfairness. The Minister abolished the first time buyer's grant overnight without notification and failed to provide any kind of traditional transitional relief. On top of that the basic rate of VAT on building services and supplies went from 12.5% to 13.5%. People who had signed valid contracts got no relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">This is in contrast to schemes for holiday cottages, where the proposal in the Bill to close the loophole is delayed to the end of December 2004 and people only need to have submitted a planning application – not even have planning permission – by May 2003. Why should groups of well-off hospital consultants, top-earning tribunal lawyers be allowed invest in schemes of holiday cottages, which the Minister has kept open for a further two years, while the same budget has hit many first time house buyers by as much as €6,000 or €7,000, particularly those in the city areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Galway?</p>
          <p eId="para_603">It is all very well for the Minister to say that on the nod and wink Fianna Fáil basis, builders would produce invoices, as his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, said, to conclude the deal by 31 December or get the grant up front. That is not possible for large estates in big cities and towns, as the Minister knows. Yet, he has kept open the loophole for the well-off lawyers and consultants for a further two years while eliminating in a very savage way the first time buyer's grant affecting young couples earning an average salary who are hoping to have a family and live in some economic contentment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_604">On Committee Stage, I tabled two similar amendments, but have not tabled such amendments on Report Stage. However the principle remains the same. I had looked to increase the limits. The Minister needs to accept the tax credit offered to first time house buyers does not nearly compensate for the loss of the first time house buyer's grant. The amount offered has already been eaten up not only by the VAT increase but by house price inflation in the interim. I might even agree with the Minister that the first time buyer's grant had an effect on house prices. It might even have benefited developers as opposed to first time house buyers. While that was his excuse for eliminating it, first time buyers depended on the grant in making up the house price. The Government should have made alternative arrangements to help those who have undoubtedly been affected by this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I approve of the extension from five to seven years. I suggest, as I did on Committee Stage, that the Minister should push that boat further to cover a ten-year period. He has ruled that out on cost grounds. Many first time house buyers now have mortgages of at least 30 years in duration of which some are second generation and others are even grand parenting in terms of house mortgages depending on the equity of their parents' households. The Government needs to be far more responsive in this than it has been to date. On all these grounds I am prepared to support Deputy Bruton's amendments. I hope the Minister has a last minute change of heart.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">In one of the earlier contributions a Deputy talked about the Minister maintaining loopholes for particular sectors. In reality the Minister has opened doors for property speculators once again. These are the people who helped force the cost of housing beyond the reach of so many potential first time buyers today. For a very short period we saw a marginal drop in the cost because of the measure the Minister previously introduced, and for which we applauded him. However, 12 months later he reversed that. It is unforgivable that at a time when there is such a housing crisis the Minister is a facilitator of measures that continue to put the price of housing beyond the reach of so many aspiring young couples and families. The measures proposed in Deputy Bruton's amendments are not the panacea for the housing crisis, nor will they make a serious impact—</p>

          <p eId="para_619">The genesis of this motion was the need to highlight the difficulties which are causing beds to be unused in our acute hospitals. Despite widespread publicity and concern about this issue, it is extraordinary there has been no serious attempt to identify or review the obstacles to finding appropriate and timely placements for patients. The immediate priority is to resolve the problem of unused beds which causes queues and waiting lists and results in patients being placed on trolleys. However, the broader, more difficult and more important issue, which has not been addressed, is our ageing population. The critical question is how we will fund the provision of care for old people.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Ideally, the transfer from an acute hospital to an alternative care setting should be seamless. If this is our objective, it would be difficult to devise a more tortuous or user unfriendly system than the one we are currently trying to operate.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_646">I will attempt to read my contribution into the record so that the Minister for Health and Children can read our comments later, if he can be bothered. There are currently slightly more than 100,000 people aged 65 years and over living in Dublin. Within 30 years, that figure will have risen to 250,000. Even more frightening is that the number of people aged 80 years and over is set to double in the next ten years. We also face a series of simultaneous developments, namely, the rising cost of nursing homes, a huge increase in demand for nursing homes, a static subvention system and a fall in the value of private pensions. Combined, these factors effectively boil down to an ever-growing gap between the cost of a nursing home bed and what the average family can afford to pay for one.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Ten years ago the nursing home subvention covered 60% of the cost of a private nursing home bed. Nowadays, it covers approximately one third of the cost, while in Dublin it covers barely one quarter. If one adds to the subvention the value of the State pension, one must still make up about 50% of the cost of a bed. Bridging this gap is the critical, almost impossible task facing families today and it places a major strain on the majority of them, for whom the cost is unsustainable for any length of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The tragedy is that suppressing the value of the subvention does not generate savings as families find it impossible to make up the difference and this, in turn, forces them into dependence on the State for a fully funded bed. The State must then offer them either contract beds or fully funded public beds. The more money directed into total provision, the less funds are available in health board budgets to provide partial subventions. This vicious circle means fewer and fewer people are being accommodated and the system fails to give good value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">More significantly, the inadequate subvention is eroding the long-standing practice by which people provide for their nursing care in old age. Precisely because people wanted to be in a position to provide for their own care, they bought homes, saved throughout their lives and joined pension schemes. At times when they probably needed money for more immediate and pressing purposes, they set it aside to have the dignity of choosing the care they deserve in their old age. People want to retain the independence to choose the kind of care they receive in their old age and do not want to be totally dependent on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">If this debate sends out one message, it is that subvention levels must be increased to ensure that, combined with the average pension, they come at least within spitting distance of the total weekly cost of care in the average nursing home. The potential tragedy is that middle Ireland, by which I mean the vast majority of ordinary people, not the very rich who will always be able to look after themselves, will quickly realise there is no point in buying a home, saving or investing in a pension. Irrespective of the efforts people make, they will never be able to accumulate sufficient funds to keep themselves in a nursing home bed in the future. Their sacrifices will be pointless.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The average annual cost of a typical nursing home bed is €35,000. Pensions are nowhere near that value. Prudent provision for the future is the attribute of a good citizen. The Government should encourage such provision and recognise the genuine efforts people are making to look after and provide for themselves. It should not throw this gesture back in their faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">If the Minister was here, the second message I would like to communicate to him would be the total absence of clarity and consistency in the way in which the current scheme is administered. Families encountering the system are mesmerised by categories such as dependency, eligibility, entitlement, ordinary subventions, enhanced subventions, public beds and contract beds. Even if all that were understandable, there is no consistency among health boards which operate different agendas. This week, for instance, one health board told nursing homes that under no circumstances were they to accept patients from hospitals unless their subventions were sanctioned by them. This week also another health board encouraged hospitals not to wait for subvention sanction before discharging their patients from hospitals into nursing homes. That is the kind of system that currently operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Added to that is the inconsistency created by the Ombudsman's ruling that all patients have entitlements to nursing home care. In this ruling he is at variance with the Government. In its strategy the Government promised legislation to clarify that issue but the legislation has not been brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">To add to all the confusion we also have the extension of the medical card scheme to those over the age of 70. Traditionally, a medical card was the criterion for eligibility for a publicly funded bed. If we are to follow that argument to its logical conclusion, everybody over 70 is now entitled to a publicly funded bed but, unfortunately, that provision was not included in any budget and those over 70 are not getting a publicly funded bed. That is another aspect of the extension of the medical card scheme to those over 70 which was not thought through. It is causing major problems for families who, at a very difficult time, are thrown into utter confusion by the complexity of the system. Increasingly it appears that many of them are falling into a category where they have no options.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">While the Celtic tiger was roaring enhanced subvention to contract beds was fairly readily available, although not with any degree of consistency or fairness. In many cases, people with assets and income got contract beds while people with very modest means could not even get a partial subvention.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">We come then to the most controversial issue, namely, the role the family home should play in the funding of the nursing home place. There is an absence of clarity, consistency and fairness in this area. Some families sell the family home without any question and even when the proceeds from the sale are spent, they put themselves to the pin of their collar to continue to fund the bed for their parent. Others dig in while the parent is still in hospital, refuse to part with what they see as their inheritance and often end up being rewarded with a fully funded bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Only legislation will give absolute clarity as to who is responsible or the way this issue should be resolved, but the Minister cannot continue to ignore it. All of these issues are now critical. Even today, the system is crumbling and in disarray but with an ageing population the whole system will collapse unless it is rationalised and clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">In the Mater hospital today, 100 beds are occupied by people who are ready for discharge. In Beaumont Hospital the figure is 86 and in Louth hospital it is 24; I could go on. Approximately three-quarters of those beds are blocked by people awaiting transfer to long-stay nursing home places. The Minister might say that problem is due to lack of capacity but that is not the case. Currently there are 216 empty beds in private nursing homes in Dublin. Those beds, provided as a result of encouragement from the Minister for Finance, who has just left the Chamber, with tax incentives to provide them, are now lying empty. That does not make any sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Worse than that, however, are the empty public beds in nursing homes. Some of the new community beds provided at great expense to the taxpayer are now lying empty because those institutions cannot afford to hire an extra nurse. There is a beautiful 90 bed unit in Laoighis-Offaly which is not open because there is no money to fund it. This is not exclusively a matter of capacity. Increasingly, it is a matter of lack of funding and, more important, a lack of political decision making. I ask the Minister not to ignore this problem because if he does, he will do so at his peril as the system is ready to crash around him.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_660">I support Deputy Mitchell's motion. I am aware of cases throughout the country where elderly people are being threatened with eviction from nursing homes because of the failure of health boards to make decisions regarding enhanced subventions. Families have to come up with €300 to €400 per week to make up the difference between the nursing home charge and a combination of the person's pension and subvention. The health board in my constituency, the Southern Health Board, has 560 people waiting for decisions on enhanced subventions. That board is dealing with the crisis cases in that where a threat of eviction exists, a decision is made. The subvention is rationed in that awful manner. It is unpardonable that following many years of prosperity and economic expansion, the elderly and those who are impaired are bearing the brunt of cutbacks and inefficiencies in these services, and the lack of political courage on the part of the Minister to make a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Last week we saw examples of power in the health services. When the consultants bear their teeth, the Minister does his U-turn. We saw that in the indemnity insurance case when he decided to succumb to the powerful blocs in the health services. However, Deputy Olivia Mitchell dealt with that aspect of the motion more than adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">This year, 2003, is supposed to be the European Year of People with Disabilities. The Irish people pride themselves on being great Europeans. This is also the year we host the Special Olympics, which are organised for people with intellectual disabilities. Before, during and after the Special Olympics, Ministers and the leaders of society will be anxious to be seen to support and attend this great event. Having attended the event in the United States some years ago, as Minister for Sport, I can say it was a memorable occasion. This should be a milestone year for disabled persons but, shamefully, official Ireland is treating disabled persons in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The provisions of the 2003 budget were devastating for people with disabilities, their families and advocates. There is no money this year for additional services. Services planned in anticipation of funding have been scrapped, as have the hopes of many for day care, personal assistance, home help, respite care and adaptable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">One aspect of the motion before the House tonight concerns the disabled person's grant. Ongoing funding shortfalls in the grant scheme have left people with disabilities and their families in an intolerable position. By June 2002, there were 11,200 applications for DPG, more than 6,700 of which were still to be processed at that time. I am aware that figure has since increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Despite the fact that demand is increasing and construction inflation is high, the 2003 Estimates show that more than €0.25 million has been cut from the budget. Over recent years, many local authorities have run into funding constraints which meant they were unable to meet commitments to the DPG scheme. Local authorities must fund one-third of the total cost of the scheme from their own resources but because of funding cutbacks, DPG applicants have had their grant applications deferred by their local councils to the following year's budget. This practice has resulted in building delays, increased costs to disabled persons and their families and major disruption in people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">During the closing months of 2002, many local authorities had begun to further erode the social and financial value of the DPG scheme by agreeing to the introduction of a review process of the administration of the scheme. We are all aware there is a crisis in local authority funding and that many local authorities are being forced to increase local taxation to make up for the shortfall in funding from the Government. However, what is now of serious concern to disabled people and their representative organisations is that some local authorities are beginning to review their administration of the scheme. These reviews are resulting in the introduction of measures which effectively erode the value of a housing adaptation grant scheme that was hard won by disabled campaigners and disability representative organisations. These measures include establishing priority systems, introducing means testing and reducing the amount of the grant available to individual applicants and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I thank the Irish Wheelchair Association which, through its chief executive, has briefed Deputies, Senators and councillors on the threat facing people with disabilities. The association has confirmed that the Irish housing stock is largely inaccessible to people with a mobility impairment. The disabled person's grant scheme was introduced 35 years ago to part fund house alterations as required by people with mobility impairment. At that time, many disabled people were living in intolerable circumstances, often without access to running water and toilet facilities. During the early years of the scheme the Irish Wheelchair Association and other voluntary groups and service providers invested considerable resources both in terms of professional advisory staff and financially in terms of personal loans and grants to support its members in making best use of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">As the disabled person's grant scheme became established, health boards took over the advisory role and the Irish Wheelchair Association continued to lobby the Department of the Environment and Local Government regarding desired changes to the administration of the scheme. The terms and conditions of the scheme have for several years been a campaign item for the Irish Wheelchair Association and other disability organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The availability of suitable housing for a disabled person is an absolute basic requirement that directly contributes to a person's ability to lead an active and fulfilled life. House alteration for a disabled person is not a lifestyle choice but a basic necessity. Until now the grant available under the scheme for housing alteration, since the 2000 budget, has been 90% of the approved cost of the work up to a maximum payment of €20,000. Each local authority recoups 60% of this money from central Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The ceiling of €20,000 under the scheme has meant that a disabled person undertaking any major house alterations experiences a considerable shortfall, often as much as €20,000, especially if a bathroom-bedroom extension or another major renovation is the advised option. Many disabled people are without personal financial resources and are therefore unable to make up this shortfall. The adaptation work is often undertaken at a crisis point in people's lives, when future work and personal income options are uncertain. Many such applicants are among the 120,000 people with disabilities who are dependent on social welfare payments or unemployed. Unemployment among disabled people is at 70%.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">In recognising both the disadvantaged situation of so many people with disabilities and that accessible accommodation is a basic necessity, many disability representative organisations and the Commission on the Status of People with Disability have repeatedly called on the Government to increase the disabled person's grant to cover 100% of the cost of the approved building work. The review measures being introduced are a cover for cutbacks because the end result of these measures will translate into people being stuck in hospital, people going on to housing lists and people being unable to live independent and fulfilling lives. It will cause immeasurable strain for the individuals concerned and for their family members and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Tonight I support the Irish Wheelchair Association's demands that these so-called review measures be terminated by local authorities and I support the demand to introduce 100% recoupable funding rather than 60%, as is the current situation. The reality is that the scheme is now supporting a far wider range of people than previously, for example, people with varying medical conditions certified by occupational therapists, elderly people, people with intellectual impairment and people with mobility impairment.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The important thing is that it permits these people to continue living in the community, either independently or with their family. It must also be noted that a major proportion of these people are existing on social welfare payments or are working in low paid jobs. It is absolutely certain that if the existing level of support provided by the scheme is not increased and broadened, rather than being eroded, many who qualify for it will be forced into residential care and social housing that will require community supports, resulting in astronomical costs to the Exchequer. As we all know, the cost of residential care is now approximately €2,500 per person per month, as Deputy Mitchell said.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The disabled person's grant scheme is being slowly but surely dismantled and the fact that local authorities are reviewing the procedures will mean that the scheme will descend into a shambles and will no longer be a uniform national scheme. Health boards are no longer supporting the scheme by the provision of professional advice from their occupational therapy staff. The disintegration and the dismantling of the scheme cannot be allowed to continue. The Government must direct local authorities to ensure uniformity in the application of the scheme. There must be no cutbacks or erosion of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">To show how useless the scheme is in its present form I will cite a case study. A young man in his mid-30s, a self-employed mechanic, crashes his sister's car in which he is uninsured. He sustains head injuries and is in a coma for several weeks and he is in hospital for over a year. He comes home, a wheelchair user and with impaired intellectual function, to a small two storey family house, where his elderly parents live. There are no ground floor facilities, he sleeps in the sitting room and he uses a commode for a toilet in the sitting room. A bedroom-bathroom extension is advised. His parents are old age pensioners and the young man is on disability allowance, with no insurance or employment prospects. The cost of the extension is €38,500 and he gets the maximum grant, €20,000, but there is a balance of €18,565. A loan is out of the question and he has no funds available. What is he to do? I could cite other tragic cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The availability of suitably adapted and designed housing for disabled people is an absolutely basic requirement which directly contributes to a person's ability to lead an active and fulfilled life. An individual's requirement for suitable housing is so basic that the entitlement to and the level of payment of the disabled person's grant scheme, which for over 30 years has supported and facilitated the adaptation of an inaccessible Irish housing stock, should not be negotiable. Any supposed review of this scheme, which would result in an eradication of the value of the scheme or in any way impact on the prompt availability of the scheme to people who require housing adaptation, should be repudiated in the strongest terms. Any so-called review measures which result in devaluing the scheme would be short-sighted and would eventually translate into people being stuck in hospital, people going on to housing lists and people being unable to live independent and fulfilling lives, and will cause immeasurable strain for the individuals concerned and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I call on the Government to terminate the dismantling and downgrading of the scheme which will make home alteration more difficult, more costly and more prolonged for people with mobility impairment. In addition, I call on the Government to come clean about its real intentions towards people with disabilities. Away from the cameras and the photocalls, the reality is that they have abandoned people with disabilities. They have broken their promises and there will be no newly adapted homes for many in the foreseeable future. People will continue to live in inaccessible and unacceptable surroundings because the Government has denied personal assistance, day care, respite care and training facilities. In the European year of people with disabilities, the Government continues to leave people with disabilities literally locked out. While the Government is locking people out, the Minister for Health and Children is taking care of himself. He is refurbishing his offices and looking after his own personal comforts and to hell with those who need help and support in the community.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_678">Some time ago I received a call to accompany a constituent to see his wife in a nursing home. I went with him and we found his wife fully clothed in bed, with the bed clothes on top of her. She was freezing. There was no adequate system of inspections to insist that the temperature in the bedroom be over 18 degrees – it was nearer 12 degrees. That may be a rare exception among some of the excellent nursing homes but it is true nonetheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The health board was on site within 30 minutes and investigated and pursued the nursing home but it took three or four visits from the inspectorate in the North-Eastern Health Board to get total compliance with temperature guidelines. I charge the Government with neglect of care of the elderly, particularly through the lack of transparency, uniformity and organisation in the inspection of nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Each nursing home is supposed to be inspected twice a year. That does not happen in every case because the health boards do not have a dedicated inspectorate. A medical officer, a nurse and others occasionally go in as a team to visit homes. It is not good enough. Nursing homes are an important part of our society that will become more vital as people live longer and will need to be cared for in their declining years.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The Government must put in place a transparent system for every nursing home and every patient. It must establish a national inspectorate for nursing homes, separate from health boards and the Department of Health and Children, that will inspect on a full-time basis, with fully qualified teams that look at every aspect of such homes. The teams should arrive unannounced at night and during the weekends. If nursing homes are fully in compliance with regulations there will not be a problem but for the minority where there are problems, they will be exposed for what they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">No one knows what is happening in nursing homes. Where can we find the information? It is not on the Department of Health and Children's website. The health board cannot help either. We should look at the example of New Jersey, where every nursing home is on the state Government website. Anyone interested can find out how many patients are in each home, the percentage with certain illnesses, the number who are mobile and the frequency and results of inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The Government has been in power so long it has forgotten about care of the elderly. For 16 out of 20 years, it has had an opportunity to address the problem but has failed miserably to do so. It is those unfortunate people who cannot speak for themselves who are suffering. What about the percentage of people in nursing homes suffering from Alzheimer's or where there is high dependency on care? How many nurses are on duty at night in nursing homes? Where is the career path for nursing home carers or those who would like to work with senior citizens? There is no structure or national training resulting in disparate levels of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">There are some excellent nursing homes and carers and some very poor ones. I challenge the Minister to address this issue in his response, not to be as complacent as the Government and ponder who will empower the Department to spend €500,000 on a nice seat for his office. What does he care about old people? It is a rhetorical question. The Minister does not care and the people are suffering as a result.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_686">Since being elected to Dáil Éireann I have had to make representations to Clare County Council every day on behalf of constituents experiencing difficulties with the disabled person's grant. This is totally unacceptable because it leaves many families in an intolerable situation brought about by an uncaring Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Since the introduction of the disabled person's grant 35 years ago, many people have availed of it to part fund house adaptation for those with mobility impairment. It worked well but the situation has changed radically in recent years, with huge cost increases in building materials and construction costs and a shortage of labour while the number of applications has also increased considerably. In County Clare there are 286 applicants. While application numbers have increased, funding has not and local authorities only get back two thirds of the cost of the grants. Clare County Council allocated €584,200 in its Estimates last year for almost 300 applicants. That money will not go far because the maximum grant drawn is 90% subject to a maximum cost of €20,320.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The disabled person's grant should be divided into two categories – extensions and house adaptations and new houses. The present system where all applications are treated the same does not work and is unfair. Six months ago a disabled woman telephoned my office. She lives alone and was told she was on a long waiting list but if she could get her own occupational therapist, it would bring her case forward. It cost her €300 but when I heard from her yesterday she was still waiting. I presume that wait will continue. It is degrading when an applicant receives a notice of qualification but the letter says the grant is only payable subject to funding being made available because the local authority is cash starved.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The system as it stands is too loose. There is no national policy on disabled person's grants so each local authority makes its own rules. As the Government acquires new jets to carry Ministers around the globe and spends hundreds of thousands of euro to decorate ministerial offices, it ignores the situation on the ground. No wonder two thirds of the electorate is dissatisfied with it. The Government is completely out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">A serious situation exists. The Government must provide the essential funding for local authorities and increase it from the present 60% to 100%. According to the Combat Poverty Agency, seven out of ten people with disabilities are unemployed. It is utterly unacceptable, as the ESRI found, that 54.4% of households headed by a person with a disability live below the poverty line. The extra cost of having a disability is met by those with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The Government has no care policy. The administration of the disabled person's grant is a shambles. Even multi-millionaires can qualify for the grant. The current policy in many local authorities is that a person who has the money should do the job and the local authority will pay later. Those who do not have money have to wait but then the limited budget is spent repaying those who had the money in the first place. This must change and priority must be given to the areas of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Medical conditions must also be graded. A person with one leg in a wheelchair must have far greater priority than someone with a mild disability. Those on the lowest incomes must be given priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Local authorities must introduce measures. We cannot wait until the Government comes back down to earth to redress this urgent funding shortage. Local authorities are starved of cash by central Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, missed a golden opportunity to redress the problem in the budget. He did not even mention disabled persons' grants in the Budget Statement despite the fact that 2003 has been designated as the year of the disabled. I deplore the long waiting lists for disabled persons housing grants and the failure of this cold, uncaring Government.</p>

Revenue funding for the development of services has increased significantly, from €12.7 million in 1997 to an additional €87 million in 2002, including nursing home subvention funding.

Between 1998 and 2001, over 550 additional beds have been provided in new community nursing units and over 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres. The additional funding of €87 million made available in 2002 provided home help service, community support structures, carers support, funding for the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and a range of voluntary groups, improvement in staff ratios in many of our elderly care units and substantial additional funding for the nursing home subvention scheme, to which Deputy Mitchell referred. A further €34 million was provided to commence implementation of the provisions in the new health strategy for older people and €10.5 million was used for the improvement and enhancement of existing services in 2002, such as additional funding provided to community nursing units, day care centres and community services, as well as a contribution towards improvements in home help pay and innovative approaches to the delivery of services for older people at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">In 2003, a total of €23.6 million in additional revenue funding was allocated to services for older people. This funding will be used for a variety of services, including home help service, the nursing home subvention scheme, support to carers, commencement of the elderly abuse programme, support to voluntary organisations, opening of new community nursing units, aids and appliances, development of dementia services, funding of day care centres and development of consultant-led services.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Since 1993, there has been an unprecedented level of investment in the nursing home subvention scheme. A sum of €5 million was allocated for the scheme when it was introduced in 1993. Due to a range of factors, including demographics, increasing levels of dependency, economic circumstances and so on, the costs have risen significantly. In 1994, the first full year of the scheme, the cost was approximately €15 million. Total expenditure on the scheme in 2003 will be almost €110 million. That is an important figure. Deputy Mitchell said the Government is not providing enough nursing home beds and funding.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_730">—there have been enormous increases, continuing up to the present day, to supply a substantial number of beds from the private sector to cater for older people. The most recent information available indicates that approximately 455 nursing homes have been registered, with 7,580 people in receipt of subvention and an additional 1,500 people approximately in contract beds. When the subvention scheme was first introduced, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, as Ministers, made it very clear that it was not originally intended to pay for the full cost of private nursing home care. The scheme was originally intended to provide financial assistance to people most in need and that is how it has operated subsequently. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned, in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation. My Department has been in discussion with health boards as to whether there are better ways of organising their funding under this heading and making sure they manage the beds under their care or within the private sector to achieve a better throughput of patients. That point has been made to health boards throughout the country and I understand the pressures under which they are operating.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">We have undertaken an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme to examine the objectives of the scheme and the extent to which they remain valid, to assess the service delivered and to establish what scope, if any, exists for achieving the programme objectives in a more efficient and effective way. In tandem with that, a review of the nursing home subvention scheme is under way in my Department. This review will look at all aspects of the scheme, including the allowances given for assets, assessment procedures for means and dependency and all other elements of the scheme. My Department is also in the process of consulting all stakeholders with an interest in the scheme to hear their views on how it might be improved to benefit the most important person involved, that is, the patient. It is planned to bring forward proposals on whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">There is an acknowledgement that there is insufficient provision of public long-term care beds to cater for our growing elderly population, with a resultant over-reliance on the private nursing home sector. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board areas are particularly affected because of a lack of public long-term care beds. This was acknowledged when my Department was preparing the national health strategy and there is a commitment in the strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">Public private partnerships are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 beds in Dublin and in the Southern Health Board region. The services offered in these units will include assessment and rehabilitation, respite extended care and convalescence. If the PPP pilot demonstrates success, it is the intention to use it as a means of providing additional CNU in other locations throughout the country. The current position of the project is that the two agencies involved, the ERHA and the Southern Health Board, are in the process of recruiting business advisers who will assist in the development of the project.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">On disability, about 1,700 additional residential places have been provided in the community. There are issues going forward. We have made significant progress on inappropriate placements in psychiatric hospital for those with disabilities and I make no apologies for reiterating in the House that we have reduced it from 970 in 1996, to 571 in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The national intellectual disability database and the physical and sensory disability database are the keys to ascertaining the needs going forward in both sectors. Despite the fact that the first assessment of needs three years ago identified that if we did certain things we would more or less meet the needs which exist, and the Government actually fulfilled its commitment in that regard, of course the review and the updating of the needs assessment is throwing up bigger issues and higher numbers in need of residential, respite, etc. Obviously that is a factor of demographics as well as everything else in terms of the numbers of people who are coming into services and in need of services, and age profiles are increasing also.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">However, there has been a significant impact in terms of the people who have now got services who did not have them a number of years ago. There has been about a 10% increase in the number of persons in the intellectual disabilities sector availing of full-time residential places. In the area of respite services, the increase has been over 200%. The numbers in receipt of multi-disciplinary services has increased by 300% and the number of children accessing early intervention services has risen by over 200%.</p>

In terms of investment, we did not get additional home helps for that €30 million but we managed to retain home helps in the service and we gave people a decent basic minimum level of pay to which they should have been entitled a long time ago, and that costs money. Often people shout about value for money and people argue about managing resources, as Deputies have in their contributions to this debate, I am merely retorting and making the point that much of the investment was in existing staff and human resources to get that up to the appropriate level.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">An additional €7 million has been made available to the health boards to increase the level of the home help service availability through the employment of more home helps, and by increasing the number of hours worked by existing home helps.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">We realise, and the National Health Strategy pointed out, that services for older people is one of the key areas going forward over the next decade. These will probably eat up a greater amount of our resources over the next decade than any other aspect of the services. From international experience, both in terms of services for older people and disability services, and particularly the experience in the United States, we know that as we expand services and increase them, the demands will actually increase in tandem and there will be always an ongoing need for further services. Despite the unprecedented growth in services for the disability sector, the waiting lists have continued to grow, even though increasing numbers of people are availing of the services. Much of that work relates to better and more refined databases.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">We published a Disability Bill in 2001. There is now ongoing work and consultation because when we published the Bill, we were criticised for not having enough consultation. We were told to withdraw the Bill and asked not to proceed with it. Subsequently a consultative process has been engaged in with groups around the country on the Disability Bill and it is in the context of that consultation that the Departments will be progressing it, and my Department will be working with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Departments on the progression of that Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I am pleased to contribute to the Government's response to this motion. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has given a substantive response to the health issues affecting older people and people with disabilities. We will now turn our attention to their housing needs and how the Government is addressing these.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">From my point of view as Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, I emphasise that both this Government and its predecessor have always taken seriously their responsibilities in relation to housing, especially the housing and accommodation needs of people with special requirements. Local authorities have for many years been providing accommodation for the elderly and people with disabilities as part of their social housing programmes, mainly in small, specially designed housing schemes linked to local community services. There is of course room for further progress in this area. My Department has therefore asked local authorities to construct even more senior citizen units in appropriate locations with a view to earmarking them for older people generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">In drafting the terms of the 2002 assessment of housing needs, we paid particular attention to the needs and circumstances of older people and those with disabilities. The outcome of the assessment provides valuable information to authorities, which will enable them to plan and develop housing schemes more appropriate to people's needs. A scheme with which Deputy Callely will be familiar is operated by Dublin City Council through which elderly home owners may offer their houses for sale to the city council. The vendor is then provided with rented senior citizen accommodation. The scheme allows senior citizens to move to accommodation better suited to their needs and generally with better access to services appropriate to older people. The resulting vacancy provides the city council with access to underoccupied family-type housing for letting to households on their waiting lists. The scheme is working very satisfactorily and I commend the city council on its success in operating this innovative scheme. There is not a lot of building land in the city and this scheme looks after the needs of the elderly and provides lettings for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Apart from the local authority housing programme, we have been very successful in encouraging the voluntary housing sector to get involved in the provision of housing for special needs groups such as elderly and disabled persons. There has been a huge increase in activity in the sector in recent years. This activity is supported mainly by my Department through the capital assistance scheme. The Government has provided increased levels of resources and support for the sector through the capital funding schemes, including the capital assistance scheme, and the sector has responded by achieving record levels of activity in the past two years. In 2002, for example, the total value of new projects approved under the scheme was €64 million, of which €47 million was in respect of projects for the elderly and disabled. This expenditure has the potential to deliver about 550 units of accommodation on completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">So far this year, funding of about €28 million has been approved under the capital assistance scheme for a further 200 units of accommodation for the elderly and disabled. The provision of this accommodation is instrumental in enabling people to remain in their own communities. This has brought huge improvements in quality of life for many of our elderly people. Furthermore, it has ensured that the people concerned have not been forced to enter long-term care at the expense of the State, as tended to happen in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I will now turn to the needs of elderly and disabled persons in their existing accommodation. While the current standards of design and build ensure that new houses provide accommodation that is generally suitable to their needs, we have retained the disabled person's new house grant to provide extra facilities required. I strongly defend the Government's record in helping elderly and disabled persons to improve or adapt their existing dwellings to meet their needs. The disabled person's grant scheme is specifically designed to allow provision of extra accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to meet the needs of a disabled member of a household.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">In February last year, the then Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt said:</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Article 20 of the nursing home subvention regulations provides that, under section 31 of the Health Act 1970, the Minister specifies a limit on the expenditure to be incurred in providing services under the Act. A board may pay such amounts as would enable it to contain its expenditure within the specified limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">In other words, there is a cap on the level of subvention that can be claimed by the nursing home resident.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Will the Government consider amending that legislation so as to provide for everybody in need of enhanced nursing home subvention? Without an amendment to the Bill, neither the Minister nor the health boards are in a position to provide the money to the people who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Ahern, said that 90% of the costs of disabled persons grants are covered. That is misleading information and if the newspapers report it tomorrow, my constituents will ask me why they are not getting 90% of the grant they applied for. The Minister of State should be truthful. I pay tribute to the staff in my local authority who are doing their best. They are trying to spread the money as widely and help as many people as they can. For the Minister of State to say that 90% of costs is covered is completely misleading to the ordinary person on the ground.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">Does the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, know that local authorities are charging €50 for each application for a disabled persons' grant, some of which are made by old age pensioners. I am surprised the Minister of State has left the House because I would like him to hear what I have to say. I will state facts whereas what he said reminded me of a word we use in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 provides that every person resident in the State is entitled to be provided with, where necessary, in-patient care by the relevant health board. This may be provided directly by the health board through publicly funded hospitals or by contracting arrangements between health boards and private nursing homes. The Government has failed to ensure the provision of this service to which the public is entitled. The Minister for Health and Children and his Department is presiding over a practice that is legally indefensible – the Government, in denying people subvention, is acting illegally.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Minister for Health and Children has advised the Southern Health Board that he is not prepared to agree that this is a demand-led scheme and has told the board to live within its allocation. This has led to elderly residents being threatened with removal from nursing homes where they have been residing for years. Last week, the niece of an 87 year-old nursing home resident was told that if the subvention was not paid the resident would have to leave the home. This is what the Government is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Under the Health Act 1970 the person in need of nursing care has a statutory entitlement to be provided with a service by their health board. The Ombudsman confirmed this position in his most recent publication. The Government has acknowledged this entitlement as demonstrated in the published correspondence between the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children. It reveals that Deputy McCreevy was demanding that the law be changed to withdraw this entitlement. The Minister spoke of an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme in his speech to the House. The Government is proposing to change the Health Acts to withdraw subvention from private nursing homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_891">The judgment of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens. Elderly people who can no longer care for themselves are surely our most vulnerable citizens and, in a civilised society, they should be entitled to adequate care. The way in which they are being treated by the Government and the worry and distress this is causing them is a national scandal. The Minister will admit that he spent €500,000 on the refurbishment of his offices last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">In the Southern Health Board there are currently 935 persons in receipt of subvention and of this total, 530 receive enhanced subvention. A further 145 persons currently receiving basic subvention are awaiting enhanced subvention while a further 186 persons who have already been provided with enhanced subvention have made applications for further increases. The reason they apply for subvention is they are being directed from public hospitals to private nursing homes. They are, in some cases, given application forms by nurses in the hospitals and their accommodation is booked in the private nursing home. This is what is happening to the elderly people in this country today. It is an absolute disgrace and the Government should be ashamed of itself.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_557">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I wish to share time. This evening's motion has allowed the Government yet another opportunity for self-congratulation. That is a pity, because what this motion calls for, and what I had hoped we would have heard from the Government benches, is a dose of reality. It is time the Government got real about the chaos and the crisis that is an everyday reality for the elderly, their families and carers and most especially for people with disabilities, who rely on what passes for services in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">In my health board area – the North-Western Health Board – by June of last year there were 893 elderly people seeking funding from the special housing aid for the elderly scheme. The figure has more than doubled by now. The fund for special housing aid for the elderly is an important part of the effort to allow elderly people to live at home in comfort and security in a house which is suitable to their needs. There is currently no money in that fund and people are being sent to the county councils to secure alternative funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">A total of €11,537,000 has been allocated to this fund this year. While this would appear to be good news, it may surprise some and disappoint others to learn this is a 3% cut in the amount allowed for in 2002. When costs are rising, the fund is falling – that is reality. Of that €11.5 million, only €1 million is provided by the Exchequer, the remainder comes from lottery funding, which may or may not be available in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The same kind of hit and miss funding applies to the disabled persons housing grant and to a whole range of service provision for people with disabilities. The funding from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the disabled persons' housing grant this year has been cut by 8%. That is a real cut, not an adjustment or a figment of the imagination.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The demand for the disabled persons grant so far outstrips the funds available in Sligo County Council that we have had to look at funding only 75% of the cost of approved works. This is neither acceptable nor just. It is not practical for most people with disabilities, many of whom may not be able to fund 1%, let alone 25%, of the cost of conversion.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">This is the reality of Ireland in 2003 – the European Year of People with Disabilities. We have to spread the resources so thinly that we are in danger of doing more harm than good. By trying to be inclusive, we may, through under funding, be excluding those most in need of support. Several years ago the report "Towards an Independent Future" identified problems within the physical disability sector. It showed a lack of comprehensive data on the numbers and service needs; inadequate access to information on service provision; disparities in eligibility criteria in between and within health board areas; inadequate statutory financial funding for individuals; uncertain funding of voluntary organisations; shortfalls in service relating to therapy, day care, counseling and home support; uneven geographic distribution of services; inadequate transport services; inadequate co-ordination of services; and poor consumer choice. It is an indictment of this Government, in power now for almost six years, that the circumstances for people with disabilities have not changed at all. The 1996 report is, to this Government's shame, still relevant. It is a disaster for people with disabilities. They are the people who are facing the harsh reality of life in Ireland in the European Year of People with Disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">This Government is newly born with the fresh gloss of the value for money party, the Progressive Democrats, and the newly accountable Minister for Finance who demands bang for his buck. This Government will demand value for money from every citizen and every service provider. Yet this is the Government that underestimated the number of people over 70 in the country and almost quadrupled the cost of the free medical card scheme. The Government has increased the costs of medicines to people with chronic illnesses without a legal leg to stand on and now has to pay back €20 million. This is the Government that spends millions on spin and photographs, smoke and mirrors. The Minister spent millions on launching the health strategy before the election.</p>

          <p eId="para_902">From my dealings with the North Western Health Board and Sligo County Council I know there are no funds available. I met a female patient from St. John's Hospital in Sligo who wants to go home. While she needs full-time care, the health board will only give her a subvention of €150. That she is receiving subvention makes her ineligible for home care help. This is what the State is giving this family to bring their mother home. I made an application for the modification of her house. The application was with the health board for two months but was returned with a note saying there was no funding and suggesting I contact the local authority. It is outrageous that there is not one scheme to co-ordinate this. It is being passed from the health board—</p>

          <p eId="para_905">Last Sunday morning the people of Ballinasloe were mesmerised by a lengthy article in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> written by Jimmy Guerin, concerning how their town had been bypassed again where job creation is concerned. The article spoke of how 1,000 jobs were lost to Ballinasloe by what was described as “IDA incompetence” and went on to outline that a leading US high tech company had shelved plans to expand into Galway after IDA Ireland bungling and red tape turned a dream into a commercial nightmare.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">Ballinasloe badly needs an anchor industry. Two years ago AT Cross closed, Square D closed dramatically a fortnight ago and the downgrading of St. Bridget's Hospital cost hundreds of jobs. To rub salt in the wound, Ballinasloe was not even mentioned in the national spatial strategy programme a month ago. Ballinasloe did not know that an American company, Consumer Direct of America, CDA, which employs 500 people in the United States, wished to expand its services and open a call centre at the old AT Cross site. It is estimated that the US company planned to create between 400 and 1,000 jobs in Ballinasloe. The mind boggles at the importance of a project of that size and the beneficial effects it would have on Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">From the newspaper article it is clear that Consumer Direct of America was not a Mickey Mouse outfit. It is a Nasdaq listed company, one of the leaders in its field in the United States. However, according to Mike Barron, the chief executive officer of the company, after he and his delegation visited Ireland and were taken in tow by IDA Ireland personnel, he was happy he had made an impression. Mr. Barron seemed to be impressed by the work ethic of the west of Ireland workers and the support of IDA Ireland. The jobs created in this new project would cost €12,000 per job created, which appears to be good value. However, after the Americans returned home, there was no communication from IDA Ireland to seek further clarification on such a huge enterprise. In December the bombshell fell. IDA Ireland said it was not interested.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I have a number of questions for the Minister. Did the board of IDA Ireland consider the CDA project in detail? Is it not reasonable to expect that after the initial meeting with a potential creator of 400 to 1,000 jobs, there would be great need for further clarification and information? What contact had IDA Ireland with PricewaterhouseCoopers, consultants to CDA, given that Mr. Barron said that PricewaterhouseCoopers did not act on his company's behalf? Did IDA Ireland send any of its representatives to the US facility? Mr. Barron says it did not. Would it not be a monumental blunder if IDA Ireland did not do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Why did IDA Ireland then take Mr. Barron seriously after he resubmitted his application by seeking references from leading banking and other lending institutions? Will the Minister comment on why Allied Irish Banks and Ulster Bank offered credit facilities and why Eircom sent some of its executives to the United States to see the company when IDA Ireland had turned it down only a month before? Why did IDA Ireland not seek the €2 million to €3 million cash facility needed to prove the company's commitment to the project on its first application?</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Why did IDA Ireland refuse to support this company? I want the honest answer. County Galway has never had to put up with anything like this before. I believe that IDA Ireland is so centrally attached to its Dublin headquarters that its regional offices only act as a type of post office. They only get what is sent to them, and in the case of Ballinasloe, it was not much.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I do not want taxpayers' money squandered and I do not want an industrial enterprise that would collapse in a few years, creating even greater problems. However, I do not want Ballinasloe or County Galway to be treated shoddily. It should get the same treatment other towns have got over the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I am disappointed the Tánaiste is not present. She was in Ballinasloe last Thursday but there was not a word to the 400 people who are losing their jobs about the 1,000 jobs that seem to have been messed up by either her or IDA Ireland.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_913">Responsibility for promoting and marketing Ireland and its regions as a location for new foreign direct investment is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland. Despite the global economic downturn, the level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">According to the IDA Ireland year-end statement issued on 6 January 2003, the number of overseas investments secured by IDA Ireland during 2002 was up over two thirds, with 55 new projects in manufacturing and international services being successfully negotiated by IDA Ireland during the year compared to 33 in 2001. In addition, IDA Ireland also had considerable successes during the year in convincing existing overseas companies located here to invest nearly €120 million in research and development activities, thus adding higher value activity to their operations in Ireland and raising the calibre and status of these companies significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Consumer Direct of America, CDA, is a US mortgage broker which operates a marketing centre in the US focused on two main areas of business, financial services and direct marketing services. The company employs approximately 350 people and approached IDA Ireland in September 2002 regarding the possibility of establishing a 1,100 person operation in Ballinasloe. Approximately 50% of the proposed employees were to be engaged in outbound telesales activities selling mortgages to the US, east coast, retail consumer market, with most of the remaining jobs arising in associated processing and customer services activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">IDA Ireland arranged and hosted a visit by senior CDA executives and their advisers to Ireland in late September-early October 2002 and discussions covered various issues, including the approval process for submissions to IDA Ireland seeking financial assistance and the contents of such submissions. In addition, IDA Ireland provided the CDA executives and their advisers with guidelines on preparing a business plan that would assist them in seeking IDA Ireland financial assistance. On 18 October 2002, IDA Ireland received a proposal from CDA to establish an operation in Ballinasloe. According to IDA Ireland, CDA's submission fell considerably short of the business plan that it would normally expect to receive from a potential investor. In particular, it contained no historical financial information, despite this being clearly identified by IDA Ireland as one of the primary pieces of information to be provided, and provided limited background information on the group. In addition, the basis for the financial projections made was unclear.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">IDA Ireland responded to the CDA proposal on 29 October 2002 with a comprehensive list of issues requiring additional clarification and information. This response highlighted the need for the provision of appropriate background information on CDA and audited financial statements for the previous three year period. A copy of IDA Ireland guidelines on the preparation of a business plan was again sent to the company. While CDA responded to some of these issues on 18 November 2002, it did not address all the issues raised by IDA Ireland. In particular, no financial information was provided. Following an e-mail from IDA Ireland to the company on the same day, the chief executive of CDA, a Mr. Barron, said he would send a complete financial package after the release of the company's third quarter results on 20 November 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">On 20 November 2002, IDA Ireland's San Jose based representative visited CDA's call centre operations in Las Vegas to obtain a first-hand impression of CDA's existing operations. This visit and the discussions that took place with senior management, including Mr. Barron, did not provide a positive impression to IDA Ireland of either CDA's existing operations and the level of activity in the Las Vegas call centre or its plans for an Irish subsidiary. As no financial information was forthcoming from CDA, and IDA Ireland had considerable reservations regarding the detailed plans for an Irish operation, IDA Ireland decided on 3 December 2002 that no financial support would be available at that time for the project in question and it advised CDA of this. IDA Ireland based this decision on financial information obtained from sources other than CDA, their assessment of information presented by CDA relating to the proposed investment and direct discussions with senior management of the group.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">On 9 December, CDA requested IDA Ireland to review its decision based on a smaller project. IDA Ireland responded on 12 December and agreed to this request on the basis that certain specific information be provided to it, but most of the information requested was not received.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">While CDA's third-quarter results were released on 20 November 2002, it was not until January 2003 that CDA provided IDA Ireland with historic financial statements. IDA Ireland indicates that financial statements for the nine-month period to 30 September 2002 showed CDA making losses of $1.3 million. Between its inception in May 2001 and 30 September 2002, the group had accumulated losses of $2.3 million against shareholders' equity of $3.1 million. IDA Ireland informed CDA on 25 February 2003 that it had decided to maintain its original decision not to offer financial assistance to CDA's proposed operation in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">As I have pointed out, the promotion of Ireland as a location for foreign direct investment is an operational matter for IDA Ireland and the day to day promotional work continues apace. IDA Ireland also has a value-for-money remit in relation to public funds and, clearly, not every company which approaches it would fulfil the criteria. I am confident that the continuing commitment of the Government to enterprise and regional development will bring positive results in terms of suitable industrial development projects.</p>

        <speech by="#EmmetStagg" eId="spk_564">
          <from>Mr. Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_922">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for acceding to my request to raise this matter on the Adjournment. While I do not wish to cast aspersions on the Minister of State, I am severely disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science is not in the Chamber to do his duty. He is probably traipsing around trying to bribe teachers into accepting his wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Sallins is a small picturesque village on the banks of the Grand Canal. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was born and reared in a lock-house near the village. No intensive growth took place there for 150 years until 1996 when the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats councillors in the area, who formed a majority on the local authority, voted to re-zone large tracts of land in the Sallins area. Builders and landowners who were friends of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties made millions in Sallins and then walked away. Absolutely no provision for the educational needs of the new population was included in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats plan. Despite a known number of children living in the area, no provision was made for their education or for their constitutional rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Sallins now needs a 16-classroom school. The Fianna Fáil Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, published a work programme for 2003, but it could be more accurately described as a no-work programme. He decided that the Sallins national school building project would not make progress in 2003 and there was no guarantee it would move ahead in 2004, so it was frozen. Yet, in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister described the project as essential. In a further reply to the House on 25 February, the Minister said there was no money for temporary school accommodation in Sallins this year. This is despite a recommendation by the school inspector that prefabs should be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">There is no room in adjoining schools for the extra pupils in Sallins. The building project for Sallins has been frozen and a request for prefabs has been refused. Will the Minister tell the House where he thinks the parents in Sallins, some of whom are in the Public Gallery tonight, will find school places for their children? Where does he think they will go? Does the Minister accept that he has a constitutional and legal responsibility to provide the required places for these children?</p>
          <p eId="para_926">A survey by the parents' association in Sallins has shown that if current policies continue the following numbers of children will be without school places in future, as follows: 76 children in 2003, 155 in 2004, 231 in 2005, and 239 in 2006. Where will these children go to school? They have a right to attend school and the Minister has a duty to provide sufficient places for them. I demand that provision now be made for three prefabricated classrooms for Sallins national school, to be in place by September 2003 to cater for the children who are currently waiting. I also demand that construction of the required seven new classrooms at Sallins national school should be allowed to go for tender forthwith. Fianna Fáil representatives in that area should live up to their pre-election undertakings.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The Government should not claim that it does not have the money. It is a matter of priorities, of deciding what is most important. I pose the following question to the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who is a local representative for the area: which is most important, a set of new Government private jets costing €100 million, the Bertie bowl which has so far cost €300 million, a savings scheme for those who do not need it, costing €500 million per year, or the provision of basic educational facilities for our children? I would answer, if the Minister will not do so, that our children must come first so a properly equipped school must be provided in Sallins. I demand it and I will settle for no less.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_565">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_928">I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the Department's current position regarding the allocation of funding for school building projects. The 2003 capital programme has been published and full details of individual projects, including schools being provided with temporary accommodation, are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently in architectural planning, such as Sallins national school. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with urgent health and safety matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">On the immediate accommodation needs of schools, the Department of Education and Science will consider the possibility of re-allocating surplus temporary accommodation that may become available or, in the event of such suitable accommodation not being available, providing grant-aid towards the rental cost of temporary accommodation, having regard to existing demands on the rental budget and the priority to be afforded to individual schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The Department is prepared to consider favourably the case of Sallins national school and the Department's planning section will be in contact with the school authorities. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_934">I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I ask the Minister for Education and Science to reverse his decision of last week to close St. Joseph's secondary school in Newtownforbes, County Longford. I further ask the Minister to give details of the situation regarding alternative secondary schools in the County Longford area. He should ask his Department to review the situation concerning all secondary school places in the county, especially in view of today's announcement of 600 new jobs for Longford. I welcome Abbott Healthcare to Longford. I thank the IDA, the Tánaiste and the Government for helping us to secure this employment in Longford.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">I am concerned to ensure that young people who will be 12 years old and who will have completed sixth class should be enrolled in a secondary school of their choice in their catchment area. Longford is growing and will grow at a fast pace during the lifetime of this Government. We need ample educational facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">I thank the Minister for the facilities currently provided, but the closure of this school is causing great concern to many people in the county. We would like a review of this decision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_568">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_937">I welcome this opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science to outline to the House the position regarding St. Joseph's secondary school, Newtownforbes, County Longford. The school is situated approximately two and a half miles from Longford town and is one of four post-primary schools in the area. It was established in the early 1950s. It was formerly an all-girls boarding school, co-education was introduced during the 1970s and in 1989 the boarding element of the school was closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Enrolments at the school peaked in the early 1990s at over 450 pupils. However, ten years later there had been a steady decline in numbers to a level of 173 pupils in September 2000. Based on this pattern of decline future intakes of less than 30 pupils per annum could have been anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">In December 2000, the school trustees, the Mercy Sisters of the Western Province, announced their intention to effect a phased closure of the school. They decided that closure would be on a phased basis over two school years with final closure at the end of the 2002-03 school year. Accordingly, there was no intake of first year pupils since September 2000, but all existing pupils, including the 2003 examination pupils, were facilitated in completing their junior or senior cycle, as appropriate, at the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Following the trustees announcement of closure, the Department received representations from a local steering committee, which was set up with a view to keeping the school open into the future. The case for the retention of this school has been ongoing for some time and has been the subject of several reviews in the Department and also by an independent facilitator.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">The Minister for Education and Science met representatives of the retention committee last October and, notwithstanding all previous reviews, he undertook to have his officials again examine all the issues, including the most up to date demographic data from Census 2002, housing and planning applications data from the local authorities, pupil movement into and out of the catchment area and the capacity of the Longford town schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Following this review, the Minister arrived at the definitive conclusion that there is no basis for the retention of a second level school in Newtownforbes. He is satisfied that there is sufficient capacity overall in the remaining schools in the catchment area to meet the projected post-primary education needs of pupils in the Longford-Newtownforbes area.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">With regard to the current situation in Longford, the Minister was made aware recently that one of the schools, Meán Scoil Mhuire, cannot accommodate a small number of pupils who are seeking admission to first year in September 2003. The Minister understands that their names are on a waiting list and the school authorities are endeavouring to facilitate as many as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">On the general question of the provision of school places, the Minister wishes to explain that his Department's main responsibility is to ensure that, overall, sufficient places exist at primary and post-primary level to meet demand in a given area. With regard to the situation in Longford, he acknowledges that a small number of pupils may be disappointed at not gaining access to their first choice of post-primary school. However, he is satisfied that there are sufficient pupil places available overall in the centre to meet demand based on the projected output from primary schools in the catchment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Enrolment trends in the Longford-Newtownforbes catchment area will be carefully monitored over the coming years. In the event that industrial and housing developments generate additional pupils in excess of existing capacity, the issue for the Department will be how to make good that shortfall within the capacity and potential of the Longford town schools. As resources permit, any requirement for capital investment will be concentrated on the Longford town schools.</p>

        <heading>Central Fisheries Board.</heading>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_569">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_946">The Minister of State is well aware of the matter I am raising. It dates back to the original proposal to permanently decentralise the Central Fisheries Board, based in Mobhi Boreen in Glasnevin in the constituency I share with the Taoiseach, to Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. I do not know if the Minister of State has information on whether that is still the proposal. Certainly it has not been acted upon for a considerable period.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The Minister of State will be aware that this proposal would affect 60 people. The Central Fisheries Board has been in its present location for more than 20 years. Decentralisation is a voluntary matter. All the conditions negotiated by the trade union movement with the civil servants would apply, if the board were permanently decentralised.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">However, out of the blue the position has changed. Temporary compulsory relocation is now the order of the day in relation to block A and block B in Maynooth. This arose out of a survey carried out by the Office of Public Works's special project unit on 16 January. It determined that the existing premises were in an abysmal condition. I am amazed that this suddenly dawned on the people concerned. The conditions described in the report are as bad as one could find. It states that the buildings were poorly converted, there are prefab buildings, it is virtually impossible to upgrade the structure, the structure does not conform to modern fire regulations, it is in breach of health and safety standards and the report also refers to portable heaters, electricity failure and to the laboratory facilities being totally inadequate. It is amazing how the staff manage to carry out their work, given this plethora of failures in the system and shortfalls in terms of accommodation, even to the extent of the existence of asbestos wall panels and an inadequate fire alarm system and external lighting.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">It seems amazing that these inadequate conditions should suddenly have dawned on the people concerned. The dire conditions in the premises could not have happened overnight. Does it not represent gross negligence that no effort was made to improve conditions or to undertake repairs prior to this?</p>
          <p eId="para_950">When the board met on 7 February, it decided that all the staff should be relocated block A and block B of the business park in Maynooth, irrespective of whether they like it or not. The board stated at its last meeting that should the relocation to block B not have taken place by the next board meeting scheduled for 6 March, the board in light of the present circumstances will give serious consideration to determining a date by which Balnagowan should be vacated. The board is putting the gun to the heads of all the workers in the Central Fisheries Board in Glasnevin. The staff there are facing involuntary temporary relocation. It is up in the air as to what is happening in terms of the permanent relocation, transfer or decentralisation of the board to Carrick-on-Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Fisheries Act 1980 is specific in relation to the transfer conditions that would be enjoyed by the staff in such a situation. Subsection (3) of the relevant section states that a member of the central board's transferred staff shall not, while in the service of the central board, receive less remuneration or be subject to less than official conditions of service than the remuneration to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which, immediately before his transfer by virtue of this section, he was subject to in the service from which he was so transferred. Will the members of staff who are being compulsorily transferred to Maynooth be subject to these conditions? It seems the board has no intention of extending the conditions of the 1980 Act to them. It also seems that the board has no intention of negotiating with SIPTU any normal arrangements in relation to compensation, voluntary early retirement or severance pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">What about retention of the existing allocation of offices? If the staff are to embark on one relocation, will they then be subject to another? Will the Minister of State give a clear-cut answer as to his intentions for the staff of the Central Fisheries Board?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_570">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_953">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The Central Fisheries Board is a non-commercial semi-State body established under the Fisheries Act 1980 and operating under the aegis of my Department. The principal functions of the board are to advise the Minister on policy relating to the conservation, protection, management, development and improvement of inland fisheries and sea angling, to support, co-ordinate and provide specialist support services to the regional fisheries boards and to advise on the performance by the boards of their functions. The Central Fisheries Board also undertakes applied research in areas of fisheries development, water quality, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">At any time up to 60 of the board's staff, including administrative, professional and technical grades, are headquartered at Mobhi Boreen, Glasnevin, Dublin. The premises is a former large residence constructed in the 1930s and used for office accommodation since the 1970s with an accumulation of attached prefabricated buildings which, I understand, are described as inappropriate for their existing use.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">Both the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I are committed to the permanent relocation of the Central Fisheries Board to modern facilities suited to the staff's requirements in Carrick-on-Shannon. My predecessor asked management, staff and the unions at the board to enter into discussions on the transfer in April 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Since that time we committed in the programme for Government to moving forward the decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. We also pledged that the needs of the Border, midlands and western region would continue to be addressed. The decentralisation of the Central Fisheries Board to Carrick-on-Shannon complies with these commitments and will be a progressive move towards balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">I reiterate the commitment to the staff that this decentralisation will be advanced on a partnership basis and on the understanding that relocation to Carrick-on-Shannon will be on a voluntary basis and in accordance with the conditions of the Government's programme for decentralisation of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Last year emergency works were carried out in Glasnevin which included the supply and installation of emergency lighting on escape routes and a basic fire alarm, upgrading the existing electrical installations to rectify urgent and major problems identified, and the supply and installation of external lighting around the premises. These works will not bring the facility to an acceptable level or standard and are merely emergency works to reduce the risk of accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">The serious deficiencies that exist in the premises cannot be corrected without major intervention and for this reason the Office of Public Works is engaged in identifying suitable temporary accommodation for the board, both in Carrick-on-Shannon and elsewhere. In the circumstances there appears to be no alternative to transferring existing staff to temporary accommodation on an interim basis, as advised by the Office of Public Works, pending settlement of arrangements for permanent relocation to Carrick-on-Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">I visited the offices of the Central Fisheries Board last year. One member of staff told me I was the only Minister ever to have paid a visit. I found the offices to be dilapidated and unsuitable for the people who work there. We gave a commitment that if property was not available in Carrick-on-Shannon in the short-term, we would ask the Office of Public Works to look elsewhere. I understand it has done so and that Maynooth has been mentioned, but I also understand it has examined the possibility of temporary accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">In light of what the Deputy said about an imminent board meeting, I will contact the chief executive officer of the board, Mr. O'Connor, to ascertain the up-to-date position and report back directly to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 March 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_967">I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 132 and 133 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The widest possible availability of competitive services including the widespread availability of affordable broadband access has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">While the provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to accelerate and promote investment in telecommunications infrastructure that fully support the government policies as outlined in the New Connections report.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">These investments will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_32">In 1999, 13 projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nationwide, including Carlow, to a value – both public and private funding –of €70 million were supported and are now completed. Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33">To date, ten private sector contracts have been signed under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Projects funded include, the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Nevadatele, the extension by Esat of its national network, and the acceleration of the Esat and Eircom rollout of DSL to towns nationwide including four locations in Wicklow and one in Carlow. I also understand that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area and has DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34">My Department is also funding the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns and the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin to facilitate the provision by the private sector of advanced communications services to consumers, educational establishments and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €60 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35">Construction of networks has commenced in Cork, Galway and will commence shortly in Mayo. Further projects, including Carlow, will commence later this year once contracts have been completed. No project proposals for metropolitan area networks were received for Wicklow under the call for proposals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and Wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions are currently under way. Five WLAN projects have been recommended for funding of €260,510. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">There have also been recent regulatory developments. On 21 February 2003 I issued policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulations, in accordance with section 13 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">They focus on a number of key policy priorities for the Commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat rate Internet access. These policy directions, together with a report on the public consultation process, have been published on my Department's website. The text of the policy directions, together with the reason(s) for their introduction, have also been published inIris Oifigiúil, in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">I am confident my initiative in this regard should bring about a substantial improvement on the current position in this area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_977">The transaction to which the Deputy refers was completed on 16 July 2001. It was prompted primarily by a concern to find a sustainable basis on which the refinery and the terminal could operate and develop within the context of a mainstream oil business, so as to secure for Ireland the strategic benefits of these facilities at least cost to taxpayers and consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Nevertheless, a significant element in the transaction was the payment by the purchaser of a headline consideration of $100 million, although it was always recognised that the net cash return to the State would be substantially less than that figure. This is because the terms of the transaction included the retention by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation of a number of responsibilities having financial implications, chiefly the company's existing debt.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_40">As matters stand, the INPC is still attending to a number of ongoing matters arising from its retained responsibilities which have cost implications for the company and which will have to be funded from the proceeds of the sale. Consequently, it is not yet possible to say exactly how much will be eventually available for remission to the Exchequer, although the total is likely to be in excess of €30 million. In March 2002, the INPC paid an interim amount of €20 million to the Minister for Finance and I expect that a further, but not necessarily final, payment will be possible in the current year.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_980">The agreement reached between the ESB, the Department of Finance and my Department on the question of ESB dividends, provides for a payment of 25% of profits for 2002, growing to 33% by the year 2005. In October 2002 an interim dividend of €19 million was paid to the Exchequer out of the ESB's 2002 half yearly accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 2001, while providing for the establishment of an employee share ownership plan, also repealed the company's break-even mandate which had existed since 1927. This in essence means that the ESB may declare and pay dividends in a manner akin to a commercial public limited company.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">The operations of State companies are increasingly taking place in the context of liberalised competitive markets and many of these companies are also increasingly engaged in activities outside their core businesses. In such circumstances, it is appropriate that they pay dividends to their shareholders out of their profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">The Commission for Energy Regulation allows reasonable returns in the regulated segment of ESB's business. There is no direct link between the CER's decision on prices and the ability of the company to pay dividends. Decisions on annual dividend payments to shareholders are ultimately a matter for the board.</p>

      <b>Mr. McGinley</b>
      asked the

       if the owners of inshore fishing boats who have registered prior to the introduction of the recently announced new limited scheme to licence and register small inshore fishing boats will be compensated for huge expenses incurred in licensing and registering their boats.
      [6125/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_575">
          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_985">The new limited inshore licensing scheme contains a number of specific restrictions which do not apply to the owners of currently registered inshore vessels. In addition the owners of currently licensed vessels will retain their existing entitlements. In the circumstances the owners of currently licensed and registered inshore fishing boats will not be financially compensated arising from the introduction of the new limited inshore licensing scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">The owners of currently licensed and registered inshore fishing vessels, having acquired replacement capacity under normal licensing policy, will retain this asset for use within the wider polyvalent segment. Their normal polyvalent licences will not be subject to the same restrictions as those issued under the new scheme, which only applies to boats under 12 metres in length and 20 gross registered tonnes. The capacity of boats licensed under the scheme will be ring-fenced and will not be eligible, for trade or use, as replacement capacity. Furthermore, it is proposed that boats licensed under the scheme will only be permitted to fish with static gear and for non-quota species, which is not the case with currently licensed polyvalent boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">The European Commission has approved, in principle, the new scheme, strictly on the basis that it will not lead to increased fishing effort in the existing polyvalent segment of the Irish fleet. The new scheme therefore only applies to currently unlicensed and unregistered boats with a proven track record in inshore fishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">Fishermen who have had a boat licensed and registered since 1 January 1990 are not eligible to apply under the scheme. The only exceptions are those who applied under the limited inshore scheme announced by my predecessor last year and have since had their boats licensed and registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The fishing industry is currently being widely consulted on the operation of the new scheme. While the basic principles of the scheme are essentially dictated by the European Commission and may not be changed, aspects of its implementation are open to discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">My Department has an ongoing safety programme involving an appropriate combination of statutory regulation, enforcement and safety awareness promotion with the aim of achieving the highest level of safety at sea and on inland waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">The Maritime Safety Directorate's business plan for 2003 includes an ambitious legislative programme which includes new comprehensive regulations governing fishing vessels, domestic passenger ships as well as transposing into national law EU Directives which strengthen the port state control regime for inspecting foreign vessels which come into our ports, and monitoring of the activities of classification societies which conduct survey inspections on behalf of flag states.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">There may also be legislative changes required following the outcome of the review of safety measures on small watercraft, which is currently under way. This review which I initiated in August 2002, is focusing on the requirement to carry and wear lifejackets, licensing requirements, enforcement and increased safety awareness.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">As part of this review the Department's Maritime Safety Directorate published a consultation paper last November seeking views in respect of the adequacy of existing legislation regarding the carrying and wearing of lifejackets or personal flotation devices PFDs. The directorate wishes, in particular, to ascertain the extent of public consensus in support of the statutory obligation to wear lifejackets or PFDs on pleasure craft in a wider array of circumstances than is currently the case, including on all open decked craft and on non-mechanically propelled craft. More than 100 submissions have been received, some very detailed, and these are currently being assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Also, as part of the review I brought forward the date for implementation of new safety regulations applicable to passenger boats from June 2003 to 1 January 2003. A series of seminars have already taken place around the country organised by the Maritime Safety Directorate to promote the new passenger boat regulations. The Deputy can be assured that the safety on our waters is a priority for me and my Department.</p>

Much of the Atlantic Margin of our offshore is either untested or under explored and every effort is being made to promote the exploration of these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">These efforts face considerable obstacles. Unfortunately, the past 12 months have seen a very steep decline in exploration activity in north-west Europe. In Ireland there are now only seven offshore exploration licences in place – down from a peak of 32 just five years ago. In addition western offshore areas are difficult to access and explore, in terms of water depth, distance from land and lack of infrastructure. These define both the difficulties and the challenge that face both the Government and the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Last November, I launched the Porcupine Licensing Initiative. Its purpose is to re-open the Porcupine Region, closed since 1999, for exploration. The region will be opened for licensing in 4 tranches as it covers a large area, 241 full blocs. There have been some wells drilled there in the past but it still has real exploration potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">The results from the "Dooish" well which was drilled off Donegal last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland also gives grounds for optimism. The company will carry out further appraisal of the well this year. My Department has long held that there was "real" exploration potential within these frontier areas and these results further vindicate this view. It is also likely that a further exploration well will be drilled in the Slyne-Erris Basin in 2003 under a licence commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">Within the past 15 months, two petroleum leases, for the Corrib Gas Field and the Seven Heads Gas Accumulation, have been signed. Production from Seven Heads is set to commence later this year and production from Corrib will depend on the outcome of the planning appeal which is at present being determined by An Bord Pleanála. In addition there will be a small satellite development, South West Kinsale Greensand, in the Kinsale Gas Field.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">This is directed at accessing gas reserves that were not being drained effectively by the existing Kinsale Gas Field wells. The target date for gas production is July 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1021">My Department's primary role regarding research and development in the telecommunications and information technology areas arises through the digital hub project in Dublin as well as in funding technology pilot projects on a nationwide basis. My Department is currently evaluating the potential of satellite and wireless technologies for the delivery of broadband services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The Deputy will be aware that both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have the primary responsibility for research and development nationally. The significance of research and development investment has been brought into sharper focus over the last year as more demanding economic conditions highlight the need to promote the development of the knowledge economy. The whole area of research and development and the development of knowledge based enterprises is currently an important priority and the work of Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Council for Technology and Innovation are important in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The strategic goal set at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 is for the EU to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. I am committed to supporting and promoting the structural reforms necessary for the EU to achieve this strategic goal, known as the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Research, innovation and technology are cornerstones of the Lisbon Agenda. Ireland is strongly supporting the objective of achieving a European research area, that overall spending on research and development and innovation in the Union should be increased with the aim of approaching 3% of GDP by 2010, and that two thirds of this new investment should come from the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Ireland has made the point to our EU partners that framework conditions should be put in place which bring research, innovation and technological development to the centre of the reform agenda set out at Lisbon. We will contribute strongly over the coming months to the development of a strongly focused EU action plan to ensure increased levels of research and development investment in Europe and we will play our part in helping the EU to achieve the ambitious 3% target. In this regard, we are pursuing a range of policies to significantly enhance investment particularly in those areas of science that will support the further development of the pervasive technologies of ICT and biotechnology. Other priorities include investment in human resources and the establishment of a strong public research base with improved industry links.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_46">Education is also critical to achieving these targets. Ireland has demonstrated that the availability of a highly skilled workforce will attract business and will lead to increased innovation and business start-ups. Ireland supports the development of lifelong learning and believes the focus should be on both ensuring high participation rates in formal education and training and on second chance educational and vocational training courses.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1027">The Government has identified a number of key priorities for the development of the fishing industry in particular and the seafood industry generally. In summary, these relate to how the Common Fisheries Policy should operate, the critical need to have a safe, modern and competitive Irish fishing fleet and also to position the sector to be competitive on an international scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">In the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Government considers it essential that the CFP should operate in accordance with a number of central principles, namely: sustainable development; better governance; more stakeholder involvement, particularly by fishermen; and an increased emphasis on conservation and stock building. In the lead-up to the reform of the CFP these elements were high priorities and I am satisfied that we have made good progress in the agreed reform package.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">A second key priority has been the introduction of a new fleet policy in order to maximise Irelands access to fisheries. The Government has recognised the overriding importance of securing a safe, modern and competitive Irish fleet and to this end some €95 million is being invested under the National Development Plan 2000 – 2006. Fleet development has been a particular implementation priority and the Government has delivered on this priority by approving 61 renewal and modernisation projects under the current programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">In so far as a medium to long-term perspective is concerned, apart from the issues at European level, there are major challenges ahead for the Irish seafood industry generally. The future of the industry critically depends on competitiveness and will require change in technology, marketing, product quality and safety assurance.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_48">These significant challenges are being addressed under a number of targeted schemes particularly in relation to innovation and sustainability, processing and human resources and marketing under the national development plan. Overall, I remain confident that the fishing industry will have a vibrant future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1052">The National Salmon Commission has now completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme and as part of its considered advice, recently recommended that the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the 2003 season should not exceed 182,000 fish. The salmon commission tendered its recommendation based on the advice of its own standing scientific committee and the management of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, which included recommendations for the allocation of this total catch on an individual district basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The National Salmon Commission has made a number of other recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme in 2003. My Department is currently finalising the draft regulations to give effect to these proposed adjustments, including the proposed district quotas for 2003. I intend to publish these shortly for a 30-day period in accordance with the requirements of the Fisheries Acts. During this time, interested parties will have an opportunity to submit any objections they may have which I will consider before I make a final decision on the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">In its latest statistical report on the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme, the Central Fisheries Board reports that in the commercial salmon drift net fishery approximately 25% of the fishermen caught just over 70% of the fish. The board also reported that 53% of the commercial drift net fishermen caught 100 salmon or less in the 2002 season.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">The chairman of the National Salmon Commission advises me that the sub-committee set up to review the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order will complete its work shortly. The sub-committee is examining the changes needed to deliver significant rationalisation of categories and the numbers of commercial licences. Subject to the emerging advice any changes will be put in place for 2004. It is intended that the question of allocating non-transferable quotas to individual licences will be considered when the outcome of this review is known.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_50">In light of the increasing importance of the information society, the Taoiseach and a number of Government officials discussed with an IBEC delegation the possibility of greater dialogue between telecommunications operators and the State. Arising from the meeting of November last year it was agreed that a shared agenda for the development of telecommunications in Ireland would be of enormous benefit for the further development of the information society in Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">The telecoms strategy group has now been formed as a means of outlining a future plan of action that will create a set of goals for the development of telecommunications and broadband services in Ireland. The group's terms of reference include, first, the formulation of an agreed goal for the development of the telecommunications sector in Ireland, to bring about more competition and wider choice in the delivery of high bandwidth and advanced data services to industry and society at large. Second, the group has been requested to set short, medium and long-term goals for the industry that are practical, achievable and meet the needs of Government, consumers and telecommunications operators. The group will monitor and propose corrective action where needed, if any changes in the environment hinder the achievement of the groups agreed goals. The group will be required to provide an interim and final report over the next 12 to 18 months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">I have made clear to the group that it should not arrive at policies involving Exchequer subvention of telecommunications services. In addition the work of the group will not dilute the Government's commitment to its regional broadband policy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">The membership of the group comprises both public and private representatives. Industry will be represented by : George Young, IBEC; Gerry Fahy, IBEC; Tommy McCabe, IBEC; Pat Galvin, Eircom; David Taylor, Esat; Larla Flynn, Alto; and Willie Fagan, Chorus. The Government will be represented by officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_54">I have been advised by the CER of the need to obtain at least 300 mw of centrally dispatched, large-scale plant by 2005 in order to meet generation adequacy requirements. This projected capacity requirement has been identified in the most recent forecast statement, entitled "Generation Adequacy Report 2003-2009", which was published by ESB National Grid in November 2002, in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">At present, there is no firm commitment from prospective participants to construct the amount of capacity required. The CER, in exercise of its responsibilities, announced on 20 December 2002 that, following extensive consultation and having examined a number of options, it was of the view that the most appropriate approach to securing additional capacity is to award a contract to one or more successful bidders, through a competitive process for the purchase of 300 mw to 400 mw of electricity. The CER is also of the view that ESB, operating as the public electricity supplier, PES, is best placed in the market to offer such a contract.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">The CER is currently developing the framework for the competitive process and for awarding the final contract with ESB PES. The CER announced on 28 February 2003 its intention to invite proposals from potential electricity generators in April 2003 when it will issue a formal invitation to tender. Details of the competition are expected to be published on the CER's website within the next two or three weeks. The CER's target date for award of the contract is 1 October 2003 with a view to having the new power plant operational by the end of 2005.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1068">I do not intend to request RTE to spend a minimum set percentage of television licence fee revenue on Irish programming. It is a matter for RTE to decide on the make-up of the programme schedules on its radio and television services that will best meet its statutory mandate. In doing so, RTE uses the combined revenues available to it from the proceeds of the television licence fee along with its commercial income. It would be artificial and less than meaningful to operate on the basis that a given programme is financed from a specific source.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_58">In practice, however, it is already the case that RTE spends well in excess of the value of the licence fee on home produced programming. Home produced programming would include almost all programming on radio. On television, almost all news and current affairs along with sports programming is home produced. In addition a considerable sum is spent on home produced drama, entertainment and children's programming.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">In defining what is public service broadcasting, I favour a broad interpretation. RTE's statutory remit mandates RTE to provide a schedule including both popular programming and programming that caters for minority interests. It is legitimate for RTE to include both quality home produced drama along with popular entertainment such as foreign game shows as part of its public service schedule.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">Sometimes debate on the definition of public service broadcasting gets sidetracked into a debate on what genres of programming are of the highest value. That is an entirely different debate. Usually, however, the highest value programming is also the most costly and choices have to be made. I am satisfied that those choices are best left to RTE to make having regard to the resources available to it.</summary>

I have rejected this approach and I am seeking revisions to the proposal to provide for the Irish box as a separate conservation zone and the restriction on fishing effort within the box based on current levels of fishing activity. I have made strong representations to Minister Drys, the Greek Fisheries Minister, who currently holds the Presidency of the Fisheries Council to have Ireland's priorities reflected in a compromise text. The Presidency is still examining the text and has not to date brought forward a compromise. I will continue to seek to influence any such compromise in order that the Irish box is maintained in EU legislation as an effective conservation zone.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">The promotion of renewable energy technologies is an established key priority of this Government. My immediate goal is to add an additional 500 megawatts of renewables based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network by 2005. Last week I announced the most intensive support programme ever to assist developers of renewable energy projects. The 6th alternative energy requirement competition, AER VI, will offer support to 578 mw of new renewable energy projects in a range of renewable technologies to be built between now and the end of 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">The alternative energy requirement programme, AER, operated by my Department supports the building of new renewable energy based electricity generating stations. Under this programme selected projects are offered guaranteed power purchase contracts with the ESB for 15 years. These guaranteed contracts reassure investors and allow developers to source investment finance which would not otherwise by available.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_61">The terms for AER VI are the most intensive support programme ever to assist developers and include 100% indexation on the bid price in each case and the introduction of a mechanism to allow front loaded payments in the early years of the contract. The AER VI programme is such that there is no reason some projects cannot build this year with substantial growth following in 2004 and more challenging projects generating by 2005. While most of the new energy will come from onshore wind projects, for the first time the competition offers 50 mw from offshore generation. Other green generators under the scheme are landfill gas, small-scale hydro power plants, anaerobic digestion plants and biomass steam cycle CHP.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, now established as an independent non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy including deployment of renewable energy sources, has already commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field specifically SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology RD&amp;D. Further information on this programme is available directly from Sustainable Energy Ireland, www.sei.ie.</summary>

I have previously stated that I will soon engage in a public consultation programme on all issues facing the renewable energy sector. This will provide all interested parties with the opportunity to make submissions on all topical issues, including the strengths and weaknesses of the current support system for renewables, the merits of alternative support systems and the setting of fresh targets to 2010 and beyond.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1079">The licensing and registration of the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> was facilitated by a decision of the European Commission, early last year, to grant additional capacity of 14,055 gross tonnes and 14,400 kilowatts in respect of the Irish pelagic fleet segment, to take account of fishing opportunities in Mauritanian and other west African waters. The European Commission's decision followed protracted negotiations with the Commission in relation to a legitimate application by the Atlantic Dawn company, under EU legislation in place at that time, which provided for the introduction of additional capacity into the EU fleet where additional fishing opportunities were identified. As the European Commission accordingly allocated additional capacity over and above the existing EU capacity limits for the Irish fleet, the Atlantic Dawn company was not required to purchase replacement capacity to introduce the <i>Atlantic Dawn.</i>Before granting the additional capacity to allow the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> to be licensed and registered the European Commission required that an outstanding overcapacity engine power situation in the Irish pelagic fleet segment be resolved. In order to address this long-standing excess capacity problem, which was not caused by the Atlantic Dawn company, the company withdrew the <i>Veronica</i> from the fleet. The pelagic segment was, therefore, brought within EU fleet capacity limits. In the circumstances, the company was allowed to retain the tonnage capacity of the <i>Veronica.</i> However, any transaction or use of this capacity is strictly subject to advance approval and must not conflict with legal or fleet policy obligations. The State has no direct involvement in the cost of tonnage, which is dictated by market forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_1084">I recognise that the environment around the inland fisheries sector is changing and that structures need to be adjusted to cope with new circumstances. This calls for a change in emphasis from traditional activities to new thinking and innovative approaches to inland fisheries management in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I have already intimated that I propose to initiate a high level review of the Government's involvement in the inland fisheries sector to consider how best to progress. It is my intention that this review will deliver a root and branch examination of the State's role and objectives in the inland fisheries sector and will take into account various reports and international experience as well as involving widespread consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Improvements are needed and the necessary structures must be in place to deliver in the future. It is clear to me that these structures must ensure that the State-management relationship is such as to be conducive to the development of an inland fisheries sector, which conserves the inland fisheries resource in its own right and its viability and economic and social contribution at national and local community level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">The development of good management and organisational practices must be fostered, which guarantee cost effectiveness and value for money in the delivery of high quality services to stakeholders. I will look to the review to define the interrelationships between the various stakeholders, advise on the appropriate role of the State and make recommendations on the optimum structures for the regulation, management and development of the inland fisheries resource in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">The report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee to the Minister for Finance endorsed my view in respect of the fisheries boards. It indicated that "There would seem to be scope for rationalising the existing structures of the central and regional fisheries board" and questioned "whether the existing arrangements represent the most efficient means by which the functions in question can be discharged."</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">I expect the review will appraise and recommend management and ownership options including, for example, enhanced private sector involvement. The review needs to be imaginative in examining proposals, which might include the transfer of non-essential core activities away from the inland fisheries management. I will finalise the terms of reference for the exercise in the coming weeks and have invited those interested to forward their views on those terms for my consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_1092">On 21 February 2003 I issued policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulations in accordance with section 13 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002. They focus on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term. These policy directions, together with a report on the public consultation process, have been published on my Department's website. The text of the policy directions, together with the reason for their introduction, have also been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The purpose of my policy direction on access to the Internet at flat rate charges is to ensure that the commission makes use of its powers as appropriate to facilitate the early introduction of retail flat rate Internet access services. Widespread availability of dial-up access to the Internet charged at flat rates and at affordable prices will stimulate the development demand for and supply of information society services. I have directed the commission to provide monthly progress updates on its delivery to consumers, and I expect that swift progress can now be expected in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The purpose of my policy direction on communication objectives is to facilitate coherence among the various elements of public policy relevant to the communications sector. Government policy for the communications sector is reflected in the programme for Government and in the Department's statements of strategy. While the commission is independent in the performance of its functions, the regulatory framework for the communications sector is an element of public policy and should play its part in contributing to the achievement of these overall objectives for the sector.</p>

The process incorporates an opportunity for interested persons to examine the documentation relating to an application and to make submissions on the proposal. It is open to any person to appeal to the aquaculture licences appeals board, an independent statutory body, against the decision on an application. These procedures ensure that the views of all interested parties on aquaculture proposals, including any such proposals in Lough Swilly, are considered in the decision-making process.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_64">The total area licensed in Lough Swilly for intensive aquaculture such as salmon farming, rope culture of mussels or the growing of oysters in bags on trestles amounts to just more than 1% of the surface area of the lake. In addition, approximately 7.5% of the area of the lake is licensed for the bottom culture of mussels, a traditional and unobtrusive method of cultivating shellfish that does not require any equipment in or on the water and therefore has no visual impact. Accordingly, more than 91% of the area of the lake is free of aquaculture and that position is unlikely to change significantly in the foreseeable future. The remaining applications on hand amount to a few hundred hectares in total and are being considered on their merits.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">As for the issue of integrated coastal zone management, there is widespread recognition of the need for an integrated approach to the management of coastal areas and resources. My Department has general responsibility, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, for the development of a strategy for integrated management of the coastal zone. A key objective of this strategy is the putting in place of new models addressing interactions between relevant sectors, agencies and legal frameworks and delivering a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the management of coastal areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">The development of the strategy for integrated coastal zone management will be taken forward in co-operation with the other public bodies concerned, will be informed by national and international experience and research to date, and will take account of the EU recommendation on integrated coastal zone management published last year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1098">The Government has in recent years introduced a range of measures to manage the home water commercial salmon fisheries. As part of these measures, the drift net season is now confined to a two-month period in June and July. This measure is designed to protect the larger multi-sea winter salmon which are of prime interest to recovering fisheries on the European mainland. The Government also introduced the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme which limited the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the first time in 2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_67">The National Salmon Commission has completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of this scheme and, as part of its considered advice, recently recommended that the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the 2003 season should not exceed 182,000 fish. This represents a 12% cut on the commercial catch in 2002. I understand that the salmon commission tendered its recommendation based on the advice of its own standing scientific committee and the management of the central and regional fisheries boards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">I also understand that the commission is of the view that we must bring spawning escapement in all districts and catchments up to the level of the conservation limit as soon as possible and within a defined time frame. The commission has further recommended that a three-year strategy should be put in place to ensure that, through further progressive reductions, the conservation limits specified by its standing scientific committee should be reached by 2005. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has already indicated publicly our concurrence with this approach.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">The National Salmon Commission has made a number of other recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme in 2003. My Department is finalising the draft regulations to give effect to these proposed adjustments.

During this time, interested parties will have an opportunity to submit any objections they may have which I will consider before I make a final decision on the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">I am aware of certain criticism about Ireland's policy on drift netting and the Marine Institute is working to assess the impact the Irish catch has on salmon stocks in other countries. While this study is not completed, I am advised that preliminary results would dispute the claim that we are preventing these stocks from reaching their spawning grounds in large numbers. In the meantime, as Minister I intend to ensure that all practical measures are taken to conserve, restore, manage and develop our salmon resource, and I pledge to do this in partnership with all in the industry who share this common goal.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1102">The main aim of Directive 95/21/EC on port state control is to eliminate sub-standard ships in Community waters. To this end, the directive agrees common criteria for inspecting ships which use a port of the Community. These criteria comply with the undertakings given by the authorities of the member states under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">One of the directive's key provisions on port state control of ships lays down that at least 25% of the number of foreign ships entering the ports of a member state should be inspected. In Ireland, 400 port state control inspections were carried out in 2002 which represents an inspection rate of 30%. The corresponding figures for 2000 and 2001 are 14.6% and 21% respectively.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_75">To enable Ireland to meet its port state control obligations, nine additional vessel surveyors were appointed to the maritime safety directorate within my Department during 2002. An additional surveyor has received ministerial approval and will be appointed in the near future. In addition, improved information technology infrastructure and better communication arrangements externally with the port authorities and shipping agents will be introduced this year to streamline the inspection operation further.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">As a result of Ireland not reaching this target in 1999, the Commission, on 26 June 2002, decided to bring an action against the State in the European Court of Justice for failure to enforce legislation on the state control of vessels. However, the Commission has also intimated that it will consider withdrawing these proceedings in view of Ireland having exceeded the 25% target in 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">Port state control continues to be a very effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards. I have asked the maritime safety directorate to continue to give this work priority. Up to the middle of February this year, 50 inspections had already been undertaken by the directorate, five of which have resulted in the detention of the ships involved. The maritime safety directorate is targeting a minimum of 35 ships per month to ensure that the goal of 400 inspections will be comfortably achieved during the year 2003. I am confident that Ireland will meet its port state control obligations once again in 2003.</summary>

The company completed a programme of technical improvement measures late last year which have contributed to improved productivity at the mine. I have recently received an application for a State mining licence from the company for a new underground extension to its existing lease, and my Department also has on hands an application for a further extension to its current operations.</p>

However, I am also mindful of the continuing difficult global market for base metals, particularly zinc. Against this background, it is understandable that this company's parent company is keeping its operations under ongoing review.</p>

Some €7,000 was paid to the association last year to cover expenses already incurred and it is expected that approximately €40,000 will be given on receipt of the cost details of the planned programme. The programme consists of publications, lectures, conferences and public events to commemorate the life of Robert Emmet as well as people such as Anne Devlin, Sarah Curran, Thomas Russell, Jemmy Hope, Michael Dwyer and Thomas Moore.</p>

In the context of the insurance reform programme, I am also developing proposals to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory basis. I will also be progressing a programme of secondary legislation, including the transposition of EU directives, over the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1466">The promotion and development of a strong enterprise culture in Ireland is essential if we are to maintain long-term growth and employment creation. The educational system has an important role to play in encouraging greater entrepreneurship in Ireland and there are a growing number of initiatives aimed at highlighting and promoting self-employment to young people as a career option. These initiatives also aim to foster entrepreneurial traits with a view to changing the prevailing climate that is seen to focus primarily on academic excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">It is primarily during the years of second level education that the attitudes, interests and creativity of our young people are developed. This is the time to encourage diversity, innovation and free thinking. It is important that our students and graduates see themselves not only as prospective employees but also as potential employment creators. It is hoped that the exposure of young adults to the world of entrepreneurship and enterprise will encourage a positive attitude towards enterprise, self-employment and innovation among students and open their minds to the wide range of opportunities available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">The South Dublin Enterprise Board is one of 35 city and county enterprise boards, which provide an excellent service throughout the country in promoting and developing an enterprise culture. The enterprise boards have considerable involvement with second level schools through the support of a number of initiatives, tailored to their particular areas, which are designed to give students practical experience in the world of enterprise. The boards offer invaluable expertise in enterprise development to schools involved in these initiatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_1470">I am very much aware of and concerned by the difficulties being experienced by some enterprises due to difficulties in obtaining insurance cover in the State. On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by me, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; the publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471">The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. However, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken as outlined in my reform programme will have the effect of improving the insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1472">My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, have agreed the terms of reference for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.</p>

          <p eId="para_1479">The Gulfstream IV – GIV – aircraft was granted a Federal Aviation Authority – FAA – export certificate of airworthiness in 1991. The recommended flying time between checks differs depending on the particular parts involved – for example engines, airframe etc. – and different checks would therefore be undertaken at say 100, 200 and 500-hour intervals. The requisite checks at the various specified intervals are set out in the Air Corps' approved maintenance programme for the aircraft, which incorporates all of the manufacturer's recommended maintenance activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">The GIV aircraft, as is the case with all aircraft and equipment generally, suffers from occasional unscheduled unserviceability. When such unscheduled unserviceability occurs, it is dealt with in accordance with the Air Corps' approved maintenance publications. Such approved maintenance publications are a feature of all aircraft, and form an intrinsic part of the Air Corps' approved maintenance programme for the GIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">The GIV undergoes a full annual maintenance inspection at a Gulfstream's maintenance facility. The last such inspection was completed in August 2002. When this maintenance was completed, Gulfstream issued the aircraft with a certificate of release to service – CRS. The aircraft recommenced operations in September 2002.</p>

The Livestock Marts Act (Date and Test and Identification of Seller) regulations 2002 – S.I. No 188 of 2002 – came into operation on 1 July 2002 and replaced the 1997 regulations.

The Exchequer does not fund the ongoing costs of data notification.

          <p eId="para_1503">Fur farming is a legitimate farming activity in this country. Under the Musk Rats Act 1933 (Application to Mink) Order 1965, the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from my Department. Licences are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection carried out by officials from my Department, is found to be compliant with a number of key conditions. My Department continues to keep in close contact with the fur industry and to monitor the operation of the licensed fur farms. There are no plans to ban fur farming in Ireland. Fur farming is permitted in all other member states of the European Union with the exception of the United Kingdom and Austria.</p>

He has received five annual payments under this scheme, which included an additional payment of €36 per hectare under supplementary measure one. This supplementary measure provided for payment in recognition of the additional costs associated with complying with REPS in areas of natural heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">Supplementary measures one and two of the first REP scheme were replaced in 1999 by supplementary measure A, which is known as measure A in the current scheme. Measure A is mandatory for participants in REPS who have target area land – commonages, natural heritage area, special area of conservation or special protection areas. It provides for payment on up to 120 hectares of target area land at €242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares, €24 per hectare for the next 40 hectares and €18 per hectare for the next 40 hectares. No additional payments are available over and above the measure A rates. In general, REPS planners, when drawing up farm plans, determine the appropriate environmentally sustainable stocking levels of designated lands. In all cases the grazing regime must ensure that both over grazing and under-grazing of lands is avoided.</p>

          <p eId="para_1515">To promote the provision of park and ride facilities, I introduced in the Finance Act 1999 accelerated capital allowances of up to 100% for capital expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of park and ride developments in or near designated urban areas which provide parking facilities for commuters using public transport. Relief is also available for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of related residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516">Guidelines on the operation of the scheme were issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in August 1999. The guidelines set out various criteria which a park and ride development and residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities must meet in order to qualify under the scheme. Certification of a development for the purposes of obtaining relief under the scheme is carried out by certain local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1517">The Finance Act 1999 also provided for capital allowances for commercial developments located at these park and ride facilities. Guidelines in relation to the commercial development element of these park and ride facilities were issued in July 2001 after discussions with European Commission officials on State aid rules. In my recent budget I extended the qualifying period from 30 June 2004 to 31 December 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1519">The stamp duty on ATM cards, credit card accounts, debit cards and cheques are charged to the financial institutions, who in turn pass them on to their customers in the vast majority of cases. The amount charged on an ATM card now amounts to €10 per annum and a similar charge applies to a debit or Laser card. A credit card account now incurs an annual charge of €40 and the charge for a cheque is now 15 cent. The stamp duty arises irrespective of the age of the person who holds the card or account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">These charges are not excessive in the circumstances and there is no evidence they significantly discourage people from using these forms of transactions. If an exemption was introduced for one group of people, such as those over 65 years, there would be demands for similar treatment for others and the base of what is already a very modest tax would be undermined. I do not, therefore, intend introducing exemptions for any group of people.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1523">I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 203 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">The latest date for which figures are available for the number of special savings incentive accounts – SSIA – opened is 30 April 2002. The total number of accounts which had commenced by that date was 1,170,208. Details of the number of active accounts on the 31 December 2002 will shortly be available, following Revenue's processing and analysis of the qualified savings managers' – QSM – 2002 annual returns. The due date for submission of this return to the Revenue Commissioners was 28 February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">The tax referred to by the Deputy is a 23% exit tax. It applies on amounts withdrawn early from SSIA accounts, the balances of SSIA accounts that are closed, other than on maturity, and on the interest and-or gains, not including the Exchequer contribution, of accounts on maturity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no official figures as to the number of SSIA accounts which are variable interest accounts. As all accounts receive the Exchequer contribution of 25%, there is no requirement for QSMs to provide a breakdown of which of their deposit based savers receive fixed interest rates and which receive interest at a variable rate.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_129">The Deputy's questions appear to imply that those SSIA deposit account holders who have chosen to receive a variable rate of interest from their qualified savings manager have made a loss on their investment and should consequently not be subject to the 23% exit tax applying to early withdrawals. As long as the rate payable on an SSIA deposit account is above 0%, the balance of the account will be the contribution the saver has made, the 25% Exchequer contribution, and any interest payment added to their account. As far as I am aware, all variable deposit interest SSIA accounts are in receipt of some level of interest.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_130">The Deputy may be referring to the fact that some participants in the SSIA scheme chose to invest in equity based products, and that many equity funds, including SSIA ones, have shown a negative return during the lifetime of this scheme. I introduced this scheme to encourage people to save on a regular basis over a period of five years. To introduce a change where some people could avail of the scheme simply by depositing money for shorter periods and then withdraw these funds without penalty would undermine the basic purpose of the scheme. Accordingly I have no plans to abolish the 23% exit tax on withdrawals from any type of SSIA account.</summary>

However, as already stated, the position is that the carer's allowance is taxable and, while the inspector is prepared to amend assessments to show the carer's allowance received was a social welfare payment rather than an emolument, this will not affect the couple's tax liability for the years in question.</p>

          <p eId="para_1544">I am aware of the difficulties created for the UNFPA – UN Population Fund – by the US decision to withdraw its funding. Our concerns and those of the other EU member states have been reflected in an EU démarche conveyed to the US authorities on this subject. Dialogue between the UN, the US and the Chinese Government in an effort to resolve the matter is continuing. Ourselves and our EU partners support this dialogue and the early resumption of US funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">The US State Department is the interlocutor on this issue as the Secretary of State has the responsibility for deciding on the compatibility of US funding with the provisions of the relevant US legislation governing the allocation of development assistance in support of population and family planning related programmes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_131">Last summer, the US Secretary of State decided to withhold $34 million from the UNFPA despite the findings of two separate investigations by independent teams, commissioned by UNFPA and by the British Parliament, and of its own fact-finding mission, that the fund is working to encourage China away from coercive policies and is not involved in supporting a one-child policy. At the time, the State Department voiced concern,inter alia, that it was possible that some of UNFPA's activities – such as the funding of computers – might unwittingly be used to support China's coercive policies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">UNFPA is working to support the implementation of some of the key millennium development goals, including the goal of reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015, and should therefore continue to be an important development partner for Ireland Aid. UNFPA's programmes also have a major focus on the fight against HIV-AIDS, one of the biggest challenges facing developing countries and one of the overarching objectives of Ireland's development assistance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">At the EU Development Council in May 2002, EU member states reaffirmed the importance of the role of UNFPA in reaching the millennium development goals in the areas of infant, child and maternal mortality and restated the EU's firm commitment to continue to support the fund. The Commission has allocated an additional €20 million to UNFPA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">Ireland is supporting the work of UNFPA in responding to such development challenges as maternal and infant mortality, HIV-AIDS and maternal reproductive health care. In 2003, Ireland Aid will contribute €2.54 million to UNFPA, a reflection of the continued importance Ireland attaches to UNFPA's work.</summary>

Spending under these headings is directed both at emergencies which develop suddenly, such as the volcano in Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002 or other natural disasters, and at longer term situations of conflict, such as Afghanistan, or famine and drought, such as southern Africa and the Horn of Africa at present.

At the request of the Ministry, in February 1998, the Pan-American Health Organisation, PAHO, and UNFPA examined the issue and recommended measures to protect the rights of Peruvian women. Immediately afterwards, a series of protocols and procedure manuals were issued to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. These were meant to ensure that family planning services are provided on a voluntary basis. UNFPA insisted on the observance of the right of users to free and informed consent and strengthened counselling procedures.</summary>

As part of its mandate, the commission decided to monitor family planning programmes to ensure the elimination of all coercive practices.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_142">The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will provide a statutory framework within which the education of children and people who have special educational needs because of disabilities can be guaranteed. It will ensure provision for people with special educational needs through a dedicated mediation and appeals system and set out a range of services which must be provided. It will also establish the National Council for Special Education which will have responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs. The consultation process on the Bill, which was extended due to the strong interest in the subject, has now been completed and I intend to seek Government approval for amendments to a revised Bill in the very near future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">Preparation for a Bill concerning people who are considered unsafe to work with children is currently ongoing in my Department. The aim of the Bill would be to establish a confidential mechanism for the identification of people who are considered unsafe to work with children and young people. It would establish a register for persons who are considered unsafe to work with children and a framework of liaison between the relevant bodies in the health, justice and education spheres. It would also facilitate co-operation with the agencies responsible for the maintenance of a similar register in the United Kingdom.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">The Higher Education Authority (Amendment) Bill will transfer funding of the institutes of technology from my Department to the Higher Education Authority and transfer responsibility for certain operational matters of the institutes of technology to the HEA. These proposals have been approved in the Cromien review of my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">Finally, the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill will establish a statutory body which will oversee the development of a modern new campus at Grangegorman, Dublin for the Dublin Institute of Technology and for upgraded facilities of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Bill will allow the new agency to commence work on an integrated urban design and land use framework plan for the Grangegorman site and to manage the development of the site as agent for the ERHA, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Department of Health and Children and my own Department. Work on the drafting of the heads of this Bill is at an early stage and I hope to bring proposals to Government in the near future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1600">I remain fully committed to achieving the two headline NAPS targets relating to literacy, namely halving the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006, and reducing the proportion of the population aged 16-64 with restricted literacy to below 10 to 20% by 2007.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_147">In order to ensure progress is made towards these targets my Department has undertaken the following steps: the first fully representative survey of reading literacy in disadvantaged schools will be conducted this year in order to establish much needed baseline data on current reading standards in such schools. This survey will be followed in 2004 by a national assessment of reading in first and fifth classes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_148">Also, the teacher guidelines that accompany the new English curriculum for primary schools recommend a range of teaching methods designed to improve children's reading and writing abilities. The Primary Curriculum Support Service has been engaged in disseminating the content and methodologies recommended in these guidelines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_149">In addition, to complement the work of mainstream teachers, all primary schools now have access to the services of a learning-support teacher to help children who have low achievement in literacy and numeracy. Also, more than 2,000 resource teachers have been assigned to children with special needs. A dedicated support team has been recruited and has begun to provide a national programme of in-service training for learning-support teachers and resource teachers which will help them to set appropriate learning targets for children who have learning difficulties, plan individual programmes to address their needs and continually monitor children's progress. To date, three seminar days have been organised for learning-support teachers and resource teachers in all schools and one seminar day has been provided for principal teachers. I have also made resources available to organise seminar days on implementation of the guidelines for learning support teachers, published in 2000, for whole staffs in schools in areas designated as disadvantaged. The purpose of the seminars will be to ensure a whole school approach to tackling literacy difficulties. These seminars will include a presentation of the NAPS targets and schools will design a literacy framework for their school so that swift progress will be made towards the achievement of the targets.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_150">In consequence of the success of the reading recovery programme, which had been piloted in the Louth, Monaghan and Cavan area, I have now extended the programme to 13 schools in the central Dublin area. Reading recovery provides intensive individual support to children who are experiencing literacy difficulties. The further extension of the programme will be considered in light of its success in the 13 Dublin schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_151">In relation to adult literacy, my Department has taken the following steps which will ensure progress towards achieving the relevant NAPS target: investment in adult literacy has expanded eighteen fold from €1 million in 1997 to €17.9 million in 2003, and participation in VEC literacy schemes had increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 23,973 by mid-2002. My Department is implementing a quality framework and nationally certified staff development programmes. Research on assessment, and international co-operation are also being pursued, the use of TV and radio has also been piloted and mainstreamed, with the third series of "Read Write Now" attracting an average weekly audience of 146,000 in 2002. In all cases, the TV programme has been backed up by free learner support packs and a freephone helpline provided by the National Adult Literacy Agency. Videos of the first and second series have been sent to literacy schemes, training centres, public libraries and video outlets. Family learning programmes, literacy and language for non-nationals, programmes for special needs and for Travellers have also been expanded; and a workplace literacy programme has been piloted successfully and is being extended to all local authority areas, in co-operation with LANPAG, the Local Authority National Partnership Board. The promotion of workplace literacy is a commitment in the new Programme for Sustaining Progress.</summary>

Where the college requires a grantholder in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant to relocate from his/her residence in order to undertake a placement of not less than one academic term/semester, the non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid for the duration of such placement.

          <p eId="para_1611">The principal of the school attended by the person applied for extra resources for him in respect of specific learning disability. In general, schools are expected to provide for children with this type of difficulty by means of their learning support service. In certain cases, this may be deemed insufficient and extra resource hours may be allocated. My Department's Circular 8/02 stipulates that resource teaching for 2.5 hours per week may be allocated to children whose test results fulfil the following criteria for specific learning disability. Such children have been assessed by a psychologist as: 1. being of average intelligence or higher; and 2. having a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics which places them at or below the 2nd percentile on suitable, standardised, norm-referenced tests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612">Children who do not meet these criteria and, who in the opinion of the psychologist, have a specific learning disability are more properly the responsibility of the remedial teacher and/or the class teacher.</p>

Arising from these concerns, arrangements were made for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, to carry out a review of a further 788 applications for such support on hands in my Department.

          <p eId="para_1627">In late 1998, my Department announced that primary school children with special educational needs would have automatic entitlement to additional resources. Shortly after that, circular letters to schools were issued, describing the roles of resource teachers and special needs assistants and quantifying the level of resources to be allocated in respect of each category of disability. The current versions of these circulars are 7/02 and 8/02.</p>
          <p eId="para_1628">When a school principal receives a professional report that indicates that a child may be eligible for additional resources, she/he makes application to the special education section, using forms SER 1 and SER 2. The professional reports are retained in the school. However, the school principal signs a declaration stating, among other things, that the application has been discussed with the parents/guardians of the children involved and that the application is based on relevant assessment reports that are available for inspection by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1629">Before Christmas, a survey conducted by the Department's inspectorate indicated that there was a significant number of anomalies in the applications for extra resources.

          <p eId="para_1633">The main objective of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school, and who might have difficulty in making a regular attendance. My Department strives to achieve this in the most efficient and cost effective manner. As a result, buses are normally required to operate a number of runs at both primary and post-primary level. This is to provide a basic service while achieving optimum value from scarce resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">The travelling and waiting time for pupils on services to the Thomastown primary schools is within my Department's guidelines of a maximum of 1.5 hours daily. I have asked, however, that the matter be reviewed and the Deputy informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>

The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects, including a project for permanent accommodation at Scoil an Choróin Mhuire, that could not be included in this year's programme.</p>

Following a European wide tendering process, eleven consortia submitted tenders for the public private partnership consultancy assignment to assist and advise the Departments PPP unit with two pilot projects, a bundle of five post-primary schools and the Cork School of Music.

          <p eId="para_1771">The total consultancy contract is €494,793, excluding VAT, of which approximately €220,000 is in respect of the Cork School of Music project and includes additional consultancy work in respect of the re-financing of the senior debt on both the schools bundle PPP and the CSM by the European Investment Bank. In addition, the Department engaged Jordan Akusik to act as acoustic advisers for the evaluation of the final three short-listed bids for the CSM project at a cost of €3,174. The consultancy tender was output-based, requiring the team to deliver nine outputs ranging from advising on the appropriate procurement mechanism to putting in place an appropriate service monitoring mechanism for when the projects were operational and which would have regard for the education specialists to concentrate on their core functions within the schools-college. As all of the outputs regarding the CSM project have not been completed, the consultants are still available to the Department and the total cost of the contract has not been paid.</p>

Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. In relation to conditions at schools generally, I should point out that all primary schools are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure. In addition, my Department has in recent years given approximately €90,000 in grant-aid towards health and safety works at the school in question.

          <p eId="para_1838">I propose to take Questions Nos. 285, 287 and 288 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1839">The widespread availability of affordable broadband access remains a key information society priority for this Government and is a key tool for ensuring Ireland's international competitiveness. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate and the widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1840">Whilst investment in and provision of advanced communications infrastructure and services, including broadband internet access and mobile technologies is primarily a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to accelerate and promote investment in telecommunications infrastructure. These programmes have been designed following consultation with, and obtaining the support of, the various development agencies: IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_167">These investments will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities, improve Ireland's international competitiveness and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_168">In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-99, and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value, both public and private funding, of €70 million were supported and are now completed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_169">Under the National Development Plan, 2000-06, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_170">A first call for proposals was run in 2000, and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million. Projects funded under this call include: the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Nevadatele, the extension by Esat of its national network and the acceleration of the Esat roll-out of DSL in 40 locations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">Under a second call for proposals held in 2001, €3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">This will be of benefit to both the business sector and domestic users. I also understand that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area and have DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of "always on", low cost and high speed internet access over the coming years to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €60 million. Construction of networks has commenced in Cork, Galway and Mayo and further projects will commence once contracts have been completed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_174">The contract signed with Global Crossing in 1999 has greatly increased the levels of competitively priced international connectivity from Ireland to Europe and the United States and has been a key factor in assisting IDA Ireland attract foreign direct investment in the information communications technology sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_175">My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and Wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions are currently under way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">WLAN is a technology that was originally developed for in-house use, such as office local area networks but is increasingly seen as an alternative technology in the delivery of broadband services. Five projects have been recommended for funding of €260,510. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">There have also been some recent significant regulatory developments to improve access to the information society. On 21 February 2003 I issued policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulations, in accordance with section 13 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002. They focus on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat rate internet access nationwide.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">These policy directions, together with a report on the public consultation process, have been published on my Departments website. The text of the policy directions, together with the reason(s) for their introduction, have also been published inIris Oifigiúil, in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1846">I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 292 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1847">I refer the Deputies to my reply of 29 January 2003, in which I set out the initiatives that have been taken at EU and national level to protect the marine environment from pollution from ships and particularly oil tankers, including the measures that were introduced following the oil tanker <i>Erika</i> catastrophe in December 1999, which polluted almost 400 kilometres of the French coastline. The <i>Prestige</i> incident, which occurred off the coast of Spain in November 2002, has added further impetus to the drive to improve arrangements for transporting oil. I have strongly supported measures adopted by the Council of EU Transport Ministers committing EU member states and the Commission to undertaking a number of new measures. These measures, which are now the subject of examination at official working group level, include further accelerated phasing out of single-hull oil tankers, proposed banning of heavy fuel oil from single-hulled tankers in EU waters, further strengthening of port state control provisions, and, where possible, implementation earlier than had previously been planned of aspects of the measures which followed the <i>Erika</i> incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1848">Discussion is continuing at official working group level with a view to adoption by transport ministers at Council on 27 and 28 March 2003. As part of the group, officials from my Department are currently examining the detail of the proposals, including assessing the possible effect of phasing out smaller single-hull tankers from the provision of necessary oil supplies to this country. Ensuring that our coastline is protected from marine pollution incidents will remain a priority for me.</p>

          <p eId="para_1850">I have not yet made any submissions in relation to the law of the sea. This issue has arisen at European Union level in the context of the discussions at the transport council conclusions following the <i>Prestige</i> disaster in November 2002. The commission has indicated that it is examining the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea with a view to proposing possible amendments. These would then have to be considered by EU member states. Ireland will consider its position on this matter as part of this process, having regard in particular to the possible effects on shipping traffic off our coastline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1851">Some member states have set in place procedures to control single-hull oil tankers of more than 15 years of age within their exclusive economic zone and some vessels that were considered dangerous have been expelled. However, a number of member states have expressed concern about the legal basis for such measures and their compatibility with international law. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg is the only body competent for interpreting the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

          <p eId="para_1853">My Department has for a long time played a pro-active role in raising awareness on safety issues. Each year a safety awareness programme is undertaken in conjunction with a number of State agencies and other bodies. The marine safety working group, which comprises members of these agencies and bodies and is chaired by the coast guard, meets regularly throughout the year to co-ordinate efforts in this regard. It is envisaged that the maritime safety directorate, established last year, will build on these activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1854">One of the strategic objectives of the Department's strategy statement for 2003-2005 is the continuous improvement of marine safety culture and awareness. To achieve this objective the directorate's business plan for 2003 has set targets including a safety awareness programme aimed at children and key risk groups, the establishment of a directorate website to provide the public with access to safety information and the development of a template for a consultation forum to facilitate debate on marine safety issues. These and other measures, such as reviewing the relationship between the directorate and other agencies and groups involved in safety awareness programmes, will be developed further over the remaining years of the strategy statement. The directorate has also recently organised a number of information seminars around the country promoting new passenger boat regulations and safety issues generally on passenger boats. The regulations came into effect on 1 January 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1856">Overall responsibility for marine pollution prevention, preparedness, response and management is assigned to the Irish Coast Guard. This includes responsibility for dealing with all aspects of oil pollution of the sea and coastal areas, and in particular: supervising the planning and implementation by local and harbour authorities of arrangements for the protection of coastal amenity, fishery or wildlife areas; the removal of oil from the coastline; and in the event of a major pollution incident, the direction and co-ordination of the on-shore response.</p>
          <p eId="para_1857">The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 provides the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with the legislative power to require harbours and ports, oil handling facilities, and maritime local authorities to submit contingency plans based on realistic risk assessment for approval by the coast guard. Templates for these plans have been provided to the harbour and port authorities. These contingency plans are part of the overall national plan, also required by the Act to which I referred, which is being prepared by the coast guard. The coast guard maintains national stockpiles of pollution response equipment at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dublin. However, no country has sufficient State equipment to respond to every pollution emergency. There are commercial companies who will provide equipment on request and guarantee it will be on-site within 12 to 24 hours. Furthermore, Ireland has been invited to accede to the Bonn Agreement between north European countries, which provides for mutual support in marine pollution incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1858">Ireland is also a member of the EU pollution management committee, which can provide experts and facilitate support, for example pollution recovery vessels, drawn from other EU countries. The coast guard can call on its marine pollution response team in major emergencies. This team is made up of coast guard and marine safety directorate surveyors from my Department and local and harbour or port authority personnel. This team has managed emergencies very competently in the past. Marine pollution response in Ireland is continuously developing and co-operation between harbours and ports and local authorities and the oil companies is strongly encouraged and facilitated by the coast guard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1862">I propose to take Questions Nos. 294 to 296, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1863">As I said to the Deputy last November, there have been some developments in the area of offshore petroleum exploration and production. I granted Enterprise Energy Ireland and its co-venturers Statoil and Marathon a petroleum lease for the Corrib gas field on 15 November 2001. I issued subsequently all the necessary statutory approvals and consents for the development of the field. The development is at present on hold pending the determination by An Bord Pleanála of the planning appeal in relation to the terminal for the gas field. The target date for first gas is early 2005, subject of course to the decision of the planning board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1864">Last November saw the issue of the second petroleum lease under the 1992 terms to Ramco Seven Heads Limited and its partners. The Seven Heads group has submitted a plan of development accompanied by an environmental impact statement for my approval and I hope to do this shortly. The plan of development has a target of first gas for late 2003. Finally, Marathon proposes to drill a well later this year in the south west Kinsale Greensand region to access gas that was not being drained effectively by the existing wells.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_181">In general, offshore exploration has been going through a difficult period in Ireland, as it has been in other countries in north west Europe. Since 1998 there has been a steep decline in exploration activity: exploration licences have declined from 32 in 1998 to seven at present and there is a commitment for only one further exploration well in 2003. However, I am assured that although these areas off the west coast have all the problems associated with frontier areas, there is considerable untested prospectivity there. This is evidenced by the very encouraging news from Enterprise Energy Ireland's Dooish well off Donegal. The well penetrated a substantial column of hydrocarbons. However, before the nature and size of the accumulation or the possibility for any commercial development can be assessed a considerable amount of analysis of existing data together with much further appraisal work will be required. Drilling and appraisal operations will resume in May 2003. In addition, there is a commitment for an exploration well which is likely to be drilled later this year in the Erris Basin off the north west coast.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_182">Given the serious decline in exploration, my concern to push ongoing exploration activity to the highest extent possible has prompted the Porcupine Basin licensing initiative. I published on 6 November a notice setting out details of the licensing process to be followed in the initiative. The area comprises the entire Porcupine Basin, excluding the two areas currently licensed, split into four tranches based on a detailed technical evaluation of the basin's prospectivity carried out by the petroleum affairs division of my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_183">With regard to non-petroleum minerals, no new economic deposits have been discovered in recent years. There have been some encouraging results, however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, County Meath – Tara Mines Limited – and Galmoy, County Kilkenny – Arcon Mines Limited – has discovered additional resources with the potential to extend the life of those mines. A good zinc prospect area near Pallas Green, County Limerick, also has the potential to host an economic deposit and exploration is continuing. The acid test of commerciality with any new discovery is whether, having made a find, the explorer is then prepared to invest in planning for mining and so makes the necessary applications for permits to me, to the relevant local authority and to the EPA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_184">New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of prospecting licences, of which there were 351 current at the end of January 2003. An application for a licence from one company new to Ireland is currently being processed by my Department.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1880">Details of the current legislative proposals for my Department as outlined in the Government's legislative programme published in January 2003 are as follows.</p>
          <p eId="para_1881">Bills before the Dáil and Seanad: The Opticians Amendment Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] has completed all stages in the Seanad and will be introduced in the Dáil shortly. The Committee Stage for the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] is scheduled for 5 March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1882">Bills, the heads of which have been agreed and texts are being drafted – publication expected in late 2003: the heads of the Adoption Information, Post Adoption Contact and Associated Issues Bill, which will address the information rights and search and re-union services for children adopted and children raised in care, have been agreed and the text is being drafted. I expect that it will be published in late 2003. The heads of the Health and Social Care Professionals Regulatory Bill have been agreed and drafting of the text is under way. This Bill will provide for the statutory registration of health and social care professionals for the purpose of ensuring a quality service for the public. I expect that it will be published in late 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1883">Bills, the heads of which have yet to be approved by Government – heads are being prepared for the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and International Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions Bill which will provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and International Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. I expect that it will be published in 2004. Work is under way on drafting heads of a Pharmacy Bill which will update and rationalise the Pharmacy Acts 1857-1977 with a view to publication of the Bill in 2004. Heads are also being prepared for the Health Complaints Bill which will provide a statutory framework for handling complaints within the health services. My Department has also commenced preparing heads of the Medical Practitioners Bill which will consolidate and update existing Medical Practitioners Acts 1978-2002 with a view to publication in 2004. Work is also under way on preparing heads of a Nurses Bill which will amend the Nurses Act 1985 as recommended by the Commission on Nursing. I expect that it will be published in 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_186">Heads are being prepared for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (Corporate Status) Bill which will alter the corporate status of the VHI. I expect it will be published in 2004. My Department is also preparing heads of the Irish Medicines Board (Amendment) Bill which will transfer the functions of competent authority from the Department of Health and Children to the board, for the Misuse of Drugs Act and for medical devices. It is expected that publication of the Bill will take place in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">In addition to the foregoing, I am proposing as a matter of priority, to introduce legislation to amend the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 in order to bring its provision into compliance with EU Technical Standards Directive No. 98/34. I am also proposing to introduce legislation on the advertising, sponsorship and sales promotion of alcohol advertising.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_188">The health strategy acknowledges the need to clarify and simplify eligibility arrangements and sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlements for health and personal social services. As part of the implementation process, a review of all existing legislation relating to eligibility for services is on-going in my Department. The outcome will inform the approach to the drafting of a new legislative framework clarifying eligibility for services.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1885">As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment lies with the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including those services provided in the Western Health Board area.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_189">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments. In the short-term, additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which €4.698 million was to fund an Initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The additional funding of €628,000 allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, includes €533,000 for an orthodontic initiative in the board.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">Last year, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received €465,000 for the treatment of patients in this way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_191">The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the staffing complement in the orthodontic department currently consists of one consultant orthodontist, three orthodontic specialists, one non-specialist dentist and one trainee orthodontic specialist who has a part time commitment to the orthodontic department. Since 2001 progress has been made by the board in recruiting an orthodontic specialist and two additional specialists commenced duty with the board on completion of their specialist training last year. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has further informed me that the number of cases awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment, as at 31 December 2002 was 1,715. This is in comparison to a corresponding figure of 2,392 in 1996, 3,642 in 1997 and 4,003 in 1998. The chief executive officer of the board is satisfied that the staff in the orthodontic department are committed to maximising throughput in the unit, consistent with maintaining high standards and quality assurance of the treatments undertaken and has reported that at the end of December 2002, there were 1,496 cases in orthodontic treatment in the board's area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives and structural changes that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times for treatment and positively impact on the future delivery of orthodontic services in the longer term.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1895">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1997 and 2002, an extra €188 million revenue and €139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of €327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year, further additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to €340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1896">This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services.

        <summary eId="sum_197">Information in respect of the end-2002 position is currently being compiled by my Department. Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the therapy professions, both at local and national level. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, made an important contribution to meeting the staffing requirements of the health services in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified therapy staff, in particular the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive by the Northern Area Health Board on behalf of all health boards in 2002. Increased attractiveness of employment in the health services has been achieved through such measures as pay enhancements, developments in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional development as a result of the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professionals. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to the recruitment and retention of therapy professionals. The introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications are other initiatives that have been taken to help meet the human resource requirements of the health services in these areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_198">Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff over recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In a human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The implementation of the action plan for people management, which I launched in November 2002, also has a crucial role to play in boosting the capacity of the health services to retain scarce skilled health and social care professionals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_199">The proposed introduction of a grade of therapy assistant into the health services was among a number of recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on various health professions. This new grade is intended to complement the roles of the major therapy professions and its development and introduction will be progressed by my Department as part of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">This initiative will form part of the overall move towards building on skill mix in the health service as set out in the modernisation process for the health service under Sustaining Progress, the proposed new social partnership agreement for 2002-05. As outlined in Sustaining Progress, skill mix is at the core of the requirement for the redesign of jobs, development of new ways of working and the determination of the quality and cost of health care.

The Deputy will also wish to know that additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health related support services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. In particular €14.6 million has been invested in health-related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €3.3 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age.</summary>

In this context, a cross departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF-mandated review of active market labour programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme which should be finalised shortly.

          <p eId="para_1937">Charges can be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay care. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges. Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 where the patient receives "shelter and maintenance" rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_204">In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_205">As the Deputy is aware, the Ombudsman, in his report on the nursing home subvention scheme, asserted that, under the Health Act 1970 any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to the provision of this service by a health board. As my Department advised the Ombudsman in its response to the draft report of the Ombudsman, its view is that the Health Act 1970, as amended, distinguishes between eligibility for a service and entitlement to a service, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. This view is supported by legal advice available to my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_206">The health strategy acknowledges the need to clarify and simplify eligibility arrangements and sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement for health and personal social services. As part of the implementation process, a review of all existing legislation is ongoing in my Department. The outcome will inform the approach to the drafting of a new legislative framework on entitlements. I expect that this review will be completed in the current year and that proposals for reform will be submitted to Government.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1941">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and are entitled to a full range of services without charge, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants' services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants' services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service. Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants' services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants' services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge where patients are admitted either as day patients or as in-patients stands at €40 per day, up to a maximum of €400 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of €40 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1942">Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment. Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain, without charge, drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with haemochromotosis.</p>

      when the refund of money for overcharged prescriptions will be made to a person (details supplied) in County Clare under the drugs payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2001">The drugs payment scheme, DPS, which replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and Drugs Refund Scheme, DRS, in 1999 was initially introduced on an administrative basis with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced at a later date. The DPS provided that families only had to meet the first €53.33 a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The DCSS threshold was €40.63 a month per certified individual, and for the DRS it was €114.28 a quarter for each eligible person and dependants.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_214">Regulations fixing the threshold for the new scheme at €53.33 per month could have been made in July 1999 under section 59 of the Health Act 1970 but as Government approval had been obtained to amend that section and it was envisaged that the amending provision would be enacted very quickly, it was decided to defer making the regulations until the Act was amended. However, amendment of the Act was delayed. Following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's Office in October 2000, regulations to fix the threshold at €53.33 per month were made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act, coming into effect on 1 March 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_215">The aggregate financial benefits for patients under the DPS are clearly significantly greater than the old schemes. The total patient benefit under the DRS and the DCSS was €95 million in 1998, the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS subvention to patients was €140 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to €178 million in 2001, an increase of 87% in three years. As claimants derived greater overall benefits, as reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at that time.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_216">My Department has reviewed the position in relation to this question. The Government has authorised my Department to put in place a process for assessing applications for refunds from persons who may be owed money arising from the introduction of the DPS. There are significant administrative issues to be resolved before a process can be put in place. My Department will address these issues in consultation with the relevant bodies. When an appropriate procedure is agreed, applications will then be invited through public notice, and each application for refunds will be considered under the terms of the agreed procedure. It is intended that this issue be dealt with as quickly as possible.</summary>

Following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll out of the national programme. In this context, the chief executive officers are making the necessary arrangements to have an external review of phase one carried out this year and are considering appropriate governance structures for managing the national programme.</summary>

Charges for care in a health board institution are made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_2053">Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 provides that in-patient services also includes care provided in a convalescent home.

Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, payment would cause undue hardship.

The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance, community employment, jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</p>

          <p eId="para_2072">BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with its phase one covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. By end December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2073">Recently I announced the extension of BreastCheck to three more counties. I am committed to its extension. Approximately 19,000 women in the 50-64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_2074">In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway, at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid-west and north-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_2075">A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will meet BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_220">Following such extension, and when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service can be delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the relevant services in her area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2125">The estimated costs, tender price and predicted completion date for the Dublin Port Tunnel are a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and Dublin City Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_2126">However, I am informed by the NRA that the Dublin Transportation Initiative, DTI, in its final report dated 1994, identified a tunnel from Whitehall to Dublin Port as the preferred option for resolving Dublin Port access problems. The estimated cost of this proposal which was a single bore tunnel only was €104 million. The Dublin Port Tunnel developed from this proposal. However, the current tunnel is very different from that originally set out in the DTI strategy. It is, for example, a twin bore instead of a single bore, it extends to Santry instead of Whitehall, and is much deeper where it passes under houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_2127">The original tender price was €449 million in June 2000. Together with land and property compensation utilities, supervision costs and other miscellaneous costs, the cost of the current project is €625 million at 2002 prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_2170">The Prison Service placed public advertisements in October 2001 seeking suitable sites for the location of a juvenile detention facility for young offenders aged 16 to 17 years, as part of the process of implementing the Children Act 2001. Submissions were received by the Prison Service on foot of these advertisements. In addition, other sites in State ownership, including all prison properties, were assessed with detailed feasibility studies completed by the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works recommended that the site referred to by the Deputy was the most suitable location of those examined and, on that basis, a planning notice under part 9 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 2000 was served in December 2002. This involved placing public advertisements in newspapers as well as displaying notices on the actual site regarding the proposed development.</p>
          <p eId="para_2171">The Office of Public Works is preparing a report for my consideration on this matter which I expect to have within two to three weeks. It will take on board all comments and observations received in connection with this project. The Deputy will be aware that I have made it clear, in both Houses of the Oireachtas, that I have not yet made a conclusive decision on the location of the proposed development. I have, however, asked the Prison Service to review possible alternatives. I do not propose to comment further until this report is to hand and I have had a chance to consider it and all of the alternatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_2217">The Garda authorities keep me informed on an ongoing basis of the problem of joyriding. A number of strategies are in place to tackle the problem. Targeted operations have been put in place by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as potential hotspots for joyriding. Specialist patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these areas to deal with public order and joyriding incidents. The Garda constantly liaises with community groups and a number of projects in operation have proved valuable in dealing with offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_2218">The Garda and local authorities work together on estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding. Physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities. Cars without taxation and insurance are impounded by the Garda and removed to compounds. In the Dublin metropolitan region, there is a dedicated car compound located at the Talbot complex in Santry. Car compounds are provided at newly built divisional and district headquarters if there is enough space on the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_2219">In relation to abandoned cars, the Waste Management Act 1996 specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with the abandoned vehicles. The enforcement and implementation of these provisions is a matter for the individual local authorities. I understand that, in general, the local authorities that provide this service have entered into agreements with locally permitted operators to take the vehicles in question for dismantling and-or recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_2220">I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 2002, are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner. This is a complex issue which has resulted in tragedy for several families in recent times. While requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, this issue can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving both the community and relevant statutory bodies.</p>

This codification will draw on the valuable work of both the strategic task force on alcohol and the Commission on Liquor Licensing, and the recommendations set out in their respective reports. Preparatory work has started and I hope the codification exercise will be completed before the end of 2004. The Report on Admission and Service in Licensed Premises, published by the commission in December 2002, pointed to a need to strengthen legislative provisions relating to drunkenness and violent, quarrelsome and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. I decided that an urgent response is required after considering the commission's recommendations in this area. I intend to bring proposals to Government for the necessary legislative changes, including stronger penalties, as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_2234">I can inform the Deputy that the group in question submitted a staffing grant application to the child care directorate in March 2002. All applications are assessed initially against the programme criteria by Area Development Management Limited and are examined by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me. Support towards staffing costs is only made available to community based projects which can show that they address disadvantage and assist parents who are in employment, education or training. On the basis of the information available to it in relation to this project, the programme appraisal committee did not recommend funding of this project because it did not rate highly under the criteria in terms of tackling social disadvantage. It is open to the group to appeal my decision. It should submit any new or additional information in support of its application to the child care directorate in my Department for re-assessment.</p>

All statements relating to this investigation were forwarded to the coroner. At the subsequent hearing, at which 34 witnesses gave evidence, the jury returned a unanimous open verdict stating that the person in question died on 30 October 2001. In accordance with the provisions of the Coroners Act 1962 a coroner is a statutory officer exercising judicial, or quasi-judicial, functions, in relation to which he or she is independent. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the conduct of, or the verdict in, this case.</p>

          <p eId="para_2242">The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. It also enables judges to exercise their discretion, within the maximum penalties, by reference to the conclusions they have reached after hearing the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission, which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. The report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_242">Penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 range from the imposition of monetary fines to life imprisonment, depending on the offence and the circumstances of the case. Possession of a controlled drug without due authorisation is an offence under section 3 of the 1977 Act. Penalties for unlawful possession of drugs for the purpose of sale or supply range from imprisonment for up to a year and-or a fine on summary conviction, to imprisonment for life and-or an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment. I am satisfied that the existing penalties are adequate and appropriate to deal with drug possession. Although there are no plans for legislative change, the operation of the law will continue to be kept under review by my Department. Finally, in accordance with the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, funds have been made available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. It is understood that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</summary>

The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of €5,577,000 has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year. A proposal to establish a Garda youth diversion project in the Curragh Camp area has been received and will be considered when funding to establish further projects becomes available.

          <p eId="para_2282">I refer to the reply to Question No. 430 of 18 February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2283">The EU formally launched its global water initiative in Johannesburg on 3 September 2002, aimed at creating strategic partnerships to achieve the goals of the world summit on sustainable development in relation to clean water and sanitation. These targets include the halving, by 2015, of the proportion of the world population without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The EU water initiative will be under development until the end of 2003 and a progress report will be presented at the World Water Forum in March 2003. Its initial focus will be on Africa and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. In this context the EU has developed an agreement with Africa, Water for Life, through which it will help its partners to develop integrated water resources management plans by 2005 which will support achievement of the goals of the world summit. The EU position emphasises that cost recovery objectives in the context of water services should not become a barrier to access to safe water by poor people.</p>
          <p eId="para_2284">The World Water Forum provides a forum for broad-based discussion on water management issues by Government representatives, experts, stakeholders and non-governmental organisations. While its conclusions will not have formal status or binding effect, the forum provides an opportunity to reaffirm political will towards solving outstanding global water issues and identifying concrete actions for expanding co-operation and initiatives on water at various levels. In particular, the forum presents an opportunity to support a substantial follow-up towards implementation of the water-related targets set in Johannesburg in 2002. The plan of implementation adopted at Johannesburg refers to the need for action to provide safe drinking water in the context of poverty eradication, protection of human health and protection and management of the natural resource base of economic and social development. It acknowledges the need to adopt an integrated water basin approach, and for actions at all levels including through regulation, monitoring, voluntary measures, market and information-based tools, land-use management and cost recovery of water services, without cost-recovery objectives becoming a barrier to access to safe water by poor people.</p>

The Bills that have been published and are at various Stages before the Houses are the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999, the Patents (Amendment) Bill 1999, the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002 and the Companies (Auditing and Accounting Bill) 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2287">I also wish to progress a number of Bills, not yet before the Houses, for which the Government has approved draft general schemes. These Bills relate to employment permits, the protection of employees on fixed term contracts, the industrial and provident societies, safety, health and welfare at work Bill and redundancy. As approved by Government, the general scheme of a Bill to consolidate company law Acts and regulations and implement the recommendations in the first report of the company law review group is being drafted. In light of the negotiations on the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, I am considering the need for legislation to further amend the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 to take account of new procedures agreed with the social partners. In the context of the insurance reform programme, I am also developing proposals to establish a personal injuries assessment board on a statutory basis. I will also progress a programme of secondary legislation, including the transposition of EU directives, over the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_2301">The operation of the disabled person's grant scheme is under review in my Department. I envisage that the review will be finalised in the next few months, at which point I will be able to establish the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme. As the administration of the disabled person's grant scheme is the responsibility of individual local authorities it is a matter for them to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within the combined capital allocations notified to them by my Department for house purchase and reconstruction loans and disabled person's and essential repairs grants. My Department also recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the balance from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual Estimates of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_2302">The significant improvements made in recent years to the maximum disabled person's grant and the level of recoupment available have resulted in increased levels of demand for assistance. Expenditure on the scheme increased from €15.8 million in 1999 to €41.7 million in 2001 and the figures for 2002 are being compiled. In line with this increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased significantly from €6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost €31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. This very significant increase in the level of funding provided is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled person's grant scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2588">The Government's strategy has been to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time purchasers. There is clear evidence that this strategy is proving effective, as total new housing output in 2002 was over 57,600 units, an increase of 9.7% on 2001 and the eighth consecutive year of record housing output. This trend is being reflected in County Kildare, where indications are that housing output in 2002 increased by close to 30% compared with 2001. The local authority assessment of housing needs carried out in March 2002 indicated that the overall number of households on local authority waiting lists in County Kildare had increased by 27% on the 1999 figure. The provision of social and affordable housing in County Kildare is increasing to meet this need. In 2001, the housing needs of some 381 households were met under social and affordable housing provisions, compared to the needs of 141 households in 2000.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_249">The acquisition of land to meet local authority housing needs is a matter for local authorities. Funding can be met from local authorities' internal resources or from borrowings through the Housing Finance Agency. Local authorities may provide housing sites at low cost to assist persons in need of housing, including those taking shared ownership through a group housing project sponsored by a housing co-operative, voluntary body or local authority. A national inventory of zoned residential land conducted by my Department in June 2002 indicated that the availability of serviced building land in County Kildare kept pace with the record levels of house completions in recent years. There were 489 hectares of serviced residentially zoned land available in Kildare at the end of June 2002, with an estimated yield of 9,700 housing units. This is a significant increase on the survey conducted in 2001 when 328 hectares were available, with an estimated yield of 6,200 housing units. This would indicate that there is sufficient serviced land available to meet the housing needs of the Kildare region into the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2599">The local drugs task forces, other than Bray which is on its first plan, are implementing their second round of action plans. Over €14.5 million has been allocated to implement the projects in the plans of the 14 task forces since January 2001. Allocations are not made annually but on the basis of the plans as submitted by the task forces. Allocations are made initially to task force projects for a 12 month period, after which projects should be ready for evaluation. Once evaluated, successful projects are mainstreamed, enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies. Projects receive interim funding while awaiting decisions on mainstreaming. The procedures I have outlined will continue in 2003. The Deputy should note that in addition to the moneys available under the action plans, funding was provided under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in local drugs task force areas. Over €11.5 million has been allocated to projects under this initiative to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_2601">Regional drugs task forces are being established in the ten health board regions under the national drugs strategy. The strategy team which is overseeing the establishment of the regional task forces has prepared guidelines for their operation in consultation with the relevant sectors and agencies. The chief executive officers of the health boards have agreed that the existing regional drug co-ordinators will act as interim co-ordinators for the regional drugs task forces. Given their knowledge and experience of the local drug problems and their relationship with local agencies and groups, I believe that the co-ordinators represent a significant resource which will greatly assist the establishment and initial development of the task forces. The aim is to convene the first meeting of each task force by the end of March.</p>
          <p eId="para_2602">Each health board was allocated €50,000 by the Department of Health and Children in 2002 to help fund the establishment of the regional drugs task forces. There been have no further requests for funding, although health boards are examining the likely costs involved in administering the task forces for the rest of the year. The budget available to the task forces has not yet been finalised, therefore. It is proposed, however, that the task force action plans will be researched and developed in a number of stages. As the task forces will be primarily engaged in consultation and drafting their first action plans over the next year, the bulk of funding required for 2003 will be for administrative purposes. Funding for future years will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates.</p>

A range of other institutional structures is being put in place to support the implementation of the strategy. A technical advisory group has been established to assist in the development of the strategy's data strategy. This group consists of representatives of relevant Departments, the ESRI, the CSO and the Combat Poverty Agency. The social inclusion consultative group is being established to strengthen the involvement of the social partners in the NAPS process. The group will consist of representatives from the Departments, the social partners and anti-poverty experts. It is planned to hold the first meeting of the group shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_252">The first annual social inclusion forum, convened by the National Economic and Social Forum, was held on 30 January, with an attendance of over 300. The forum provided an opportunity for those working on the ground in the area of social inclusion to have a direct input into the NAPS process. The Office for Social Inclusion is engaged in the process of preparing the second national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, to cover the period from 2003 to 2005. This plan must be submitted to the EU by the end of July 2003. A public consultation process, arrangements for which are currently being drawn up in collaboration with the Combat Poverty Agency, will be a key feature of the preparation of the plan.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2614">The school meals programme provides funding for the urban school meals scheme, which operates in conjunction with certain local authorities, as well as individual innovative school meals projects in both urban and rural areas. In 2002, €2.02 million was spent on the school meals programme. It is estimated that some 380 schools, with a total of over 60,000 pupils, benefited from the urban scheme while 105 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which benefited approximately 11,000 children under other projects. My Department received an additional €2.35 million in the budget, which will enable me to enhance and expand this service. It is not possible to quantify the number of additional pupils who will benefit as a result. This is because the extra funding will be used not only to increase the participation rate but also to improve the meals provided in some instances.</p>

The qualifying age for old age pension was, over time, subsequently reduced to 66 years of age. The retirement condition now only applies to one year. The Government is committed, as part of An Agreed Programme for Government, to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension.

          <p eId="para_2640">The job initiative programme is one of a number of FÁS schemes in which lone parents may participate. Full-time employment is provided in the social economy for individuals who are over 35 and fulfil certain criteria under the programme. Lone parents qualify for the programme if they have been in receipt of one-parent family payment, unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, or a combination of these schemes, for a minimum of five years. Significant earnings disregards are built into the one-parent allowance scheme to encourage lone parents who wish to take up work. No similar disregards are applicable in other means tested schemes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_256">Lone parents are also eligible for the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department. The operation of the earnings disregard means that a lone parent may earn up to €293 per week and still retain an entitlement to some level of lone parent payment. Arrangements are in place thereafter whereby a lone parent who exceeds the earnings threshold may retain 50% of the payment they had been receiving for a further 12 months. The purpose of these arrangements is to provide a manageable transition from welfare dependency to employment. It appears that 410 recipients of the one-parent family payment are on the job initiative programme and, of these, 395 will benefit from the transitional arrangements available under the one-parent family payment scheme. The effects on lone parents of the increase in the job initiative payment are being examined. Any decision in relation to changing the one-parent family payment would have to have regard to the overall policy objective, which is to support and facilitate lone parents in taking up employment, thereby improving the financial position of them and their children.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2642">Changes in the back to work allowance scheme were made in the light of major economic and labour market changes and, in particular, the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993. The review also took cognisance of an independent evaluation of the scheme which recommended, in the light of the tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the long-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced. It was recognised in the independent evaluation report that a distinction was to be made between the self-employed and employee strands of the scheme. It was also noted that research showed that 54% of self-employed participants felt they would have entered self-employment without the aid of the allowance.</p>

It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the most vulnerable groups. The Department's jobs facilitators will continue to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants into self-employment and employment by providing them with assistance and information on an individual basis.

          <p eId="para_2644">The bereavement grant is based on PRSI contributions and is designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. The grant is payable on the death of an insured person or a family member, including a child under the age of 18, or under the age of 22 if in full-time education. The grant is not payable on the death of a person over these ages, unless they are qualified on the basis of their PRSI contributions. As the person in question had not paid contributions, it was not possible to pay a bereavement grant in her case. Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions, a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under this scheme, a health board may make a single payment to help meet once-off exceptional expenditure, for example, funeral expenses which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. Any change to the bereavement grant scheme will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

Under these arrangements and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to the patients either free of charge or at a reduced fee and the Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates. The dispute arose because dentists were imposing increased fees, which in some cases were considerably in excess of the agreed levels.

The cost to the patient will increase by 10% in respect of these treatments as will the contribution by the Department towards the costs of these treatments. This means that a patient will pay nothing extra for oral examination or scale and polish but will pay an extra €1.08 for extractions. In the case of fillings, my Department's contribution towards the cost of each filling will increase by 10%, for example from €26.54 to €29.20 in the case of a simple amalgam filling. The cost to the patient will be the normal private fee, less 15%, less my Department's contribution.

          <p eId="para_2655">My Department has no record of a claim for carer's allowance from the person in question. Carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the income of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner when determining entitlement. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The current income disregard for single carers is €191 per week and €382 per week for couples. In budget 2003, there was a further increase in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test. The disregard for single carers increased to €210 per week while the disregard for couples increased to €420 per week. These improvements take effect from April 2003.</p>
