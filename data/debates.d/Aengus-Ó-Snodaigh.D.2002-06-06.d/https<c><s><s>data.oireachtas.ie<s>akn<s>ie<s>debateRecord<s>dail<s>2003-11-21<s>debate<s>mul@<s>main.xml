        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. B. Smith:</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation. I compliment the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Noel Ahern, and his colleague in the Department, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on bringing forward this important legislation which is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The Bill is comprehensive, progressive and well balanced. It contains the appropriate balance between the needs of those providing rented accommodation and those who are renting such accommodation. The Bill provides a fair deal for all. It does not place unreasonable demands on landlords and it provides the basis for a fair deal for all tenants. This legislation can help to stabilise the entire rented sector which has not had stability in the past. The expansion of housing needs will continue to generate the need for more investment from the private sector and such investment expanding the housing supply will be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The Bill outlines in a proper way the minimum legal obligations of both landlords and tenants and incorporates the necessary measures to improve security of tenure. It also limits rent to market level and annual reviews at the most.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The legislation provides for the establishment of a Private Residential Tenancies Board and a new tenancy registration system. This will provide for a proper statutory dispute resolution service which can be effective. I welcome the statement in the Minister of State's contribution that the board will be in a position to review the effectiveness and the operation of the legislation. I hope that the mediation and arbitration approach, which is the basis for the workings of the board, will be satisfactory and will enable the effective and speedy resolution of disputes that may arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I recently attended a function of the Cavan Association in London and I was asked to raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, in particular the needs of some of our emigrants who are living in poor circumstances throughout Britain and in North America. Some local authorities have begun a process of providing housing accommodation for some emigrants who may wish to return to their native counties. My local authority is embarking on such a programme. Under the substantial local authority housing programme the Minister put in place over the past two years and which will be ongoing in 2004, I hope he will direct local authorities to provide some of that new housing stock for emigrants who may wish to return. We all know, particularly those of us who come from rural constituencies which were devastated by emigration in the 1950s, 1960s and in later years, that many of those people left these shores in difficult times. Many of them contributed handsomely to this country by sending home money to ensure that their younger siblings could be reared. They helped in a positive manner to ensure that some families had at least a basic and minimum standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">In his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, will he arrange for his Department to co-ordinate a programme throughout all local authorities, particularly those in rural areas, to ensure that progress is made in putting housing at the disposal of emigrants who may wish to return home? I hope the Minister will meet representatives of some of the voluntary associations in London and elsewhere which are trying to co-ordinate such a programme and that work on it can be speeded up and driven by him and his Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">In recent years there has been a welcome increase in the supply of housing. We all know there has been great pressure in terms of housing supply and in recent years the quality of local authority housing has improved dramatically. A person can drive into a local authority housing estate today and note the high standard of design. Such houses are probably of a better quality than the houses in private estates. As Deputy Johnny Brady said last night, great credit is due to the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Ministers of State at that Department for their progress in ensuring substantial funding was made available to local authorities to provide the largest ever housing construction programme, houses that are of an exceptionally high standard, both of design and quality of construction. I am aware the Minister has obtained substantial funding for 2004 to ensure that this house construction programme continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">For far too long the rights of tenants, particularly of houses, were practically non-existent. Fortunately, in recent years we have had very welcome advances in consumer rights, but the rights of tenants have lagged behind. The Bill address these deficiencies. Huge profits can be made from property and the tenants who generate these profits are fully deserving of their rights as consumers. The Bill provides for a more professional approach in the rental market, which is good for tenants and for the long-term stability of the sector, particularly for those who are able to supply such property. It will mean enhanced property standards and improved management and it will ensure an increase in the supply and quality of accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">A person should have a genuine sense of home in the place where he or she lives, regardless of whether it is rented or purchased. For far too long Ireland has adopted a Victorian approach to property rights. The system was weighed heavily in favour of the landlord. Tenants had to clock up 21 years in a property before they gained security of tenure. As a consequence of tenants having few rights and no security, Ireland has been out of sync with the rest of Europe. Across Europe renting is seen as a real option for the medium to long-term. An effective and law-based rental sector must be part of our modern economy, where there is more mobility.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">I support the comments of Threshold, the national housing organisation, which has broadly welcomed the measured proposed by the Bill. The legal rights of the tenant and the landlord will now derive from law as well as from any written or verbal tenancy agreement between tenant and landlord. A tenant will be entitled to quiet and peaceful enjoyment of his or her home. The landlord will only be allowed to enter with the permission of the tenant, which is right, and if he or she needs to carry out repairs or inspect the premises it will have to be by prior arrangement. If a property is put up for sale the landlord will be obliged to agree viewing times with the tenant. These are practical measures which are being put into legislation. Most reasonable landlords will have always lived up to those standards anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">We all know that, unfortunately, as well as bad landlords, there are troublesome tenants. Deputy Killeen referred last night to the major problem of anti-social behaviour, which occurs in many towns throughout the country. It is a problem that local authorities find difficult to come to terms with and eliminate. There are no easy solutions to this vexed question. This behaviour can destroy many lives in what would normally be quiet estates.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The system up to now has weighed heavily in favour of landlords. I do not know whether it was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, or the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who stated that this legislation marked the most effective overhaul ever of tenants' rights. He referred to the days of the land wars and struggle for tenants' rights led by Michael Davitt and others. It is ironic that the rights of tenants on land, which were well established more than 100 years ago, have never been properly established in law for housing. This Bill rights that wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The Bill was drafted after widespread consultation by the Department and the Minister. I do not see how any sector, whether landlords, property owners or tenants' rights advocates, could be unhappy with it. I welcome the Minister's statement that he will review and take into account submissions or recommendations from the tenancy board on the effectiveness and operation of the Bill. He has indicated that he has an open mind towards amendments which may improve the legislation. This is flagship legislation, which is long overdue and particularly important for a sector in which, unfortunately, basic standards have been lacking in the past. In recent years the standards of rented accommodation have improved dramatically, driven by the numbers of investors going into the market and the consequent increase in the amount of accommodation available. I commend the Minister and his Department for introducing this important and innovative legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan:</from>
          <p eId="para_18">That was a very progressive move. Deputy Brady asked me whether we would bring them back. There is no need – Fianna Fáil has already brought them back through a thousand different measures. Every day the Government brings in some replacement charge for something it does not provide. It has simply decided that in some amorphous area it must squeeze out of the luckless population money they do not have for something they will not receive. The emergence of the Bill at this time is of historical significance. The fact that we are back to discussing landlords and tenants, as the previous speaker recognised, is significant in itself. The fact that after 100 years or more we must again identify the rights of tenants is an indication of where we have gone in the past five or six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Twenty years ago everyone had the aspiration of owning a home of his or her own. It was the aspiration of every young person, every one of the new generation, but it is no longer the case. Now the younger generation can only view photographs of other people's houses because they will never own their own. We have gone back almost to the days of the workhouse. Local authorities are readily referring whole families to emergency accommodation and hostels – sometimes they must even sleep in the open air. The Minister of the day does not even know how many people are sleeping rough in this capital city.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">—I have to ask myself what country I have been living in for the past five years. I have tabled countless questions to both the current and previous Ministers asking what the Government intended to do about the housing crisis. I was told again and again that there was no crisis. The Government is like an ostrich that buries its head in the sand. If the Government continues like this the Ceann Comhairle will have to come to its rescue. It is leaving itself invitingly open to getting a sharp response from the electorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The House does not fully recognises the severity of the housing situation. Everyone knows there is a serious housing problem, as evidenced by the number of people on local authority housing lists and those in need of affordable housing. Instead of doing something about it, the Government decided to count them once again to make sure that some of those on the lists were not given a house by accident, had not won one on a television or radio programme or miraculously secured one by other means. It took a year and a half to count them and when this was done, the Government decided to look at it once again and produce more statistics. Now we must deal with the Bill before the House. I am saddened that we have come to this juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I listened with great interest to the submissions from the other side of the House. Many years ago I saw graffiti on the promenade in the exclusive confines of Dún Laoghaire. The slogan read, "Vote Fianna Fáil, the party that made meat luxury". This could be added to today and could read, "Vote Fianna Fáil, the party that made housing unattainable".

          <from>Mr. Durkan:</from>
          <p eId="para_48">I will discuss that again. The legacy of the Government is one of failure. It is a failure to recognise the needs of those who wish to be housed or even accept that a problem exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">It would be remiss of the House not to point out the problems that loom for these families. The policy has been anti-family. Young people cannot get married or enter into permanent relationships because they have nowhere to live. They are at the mercy of the housing market, a notional concept that is supposed to provide something when the Government fails to do so. While the voluntary agencies are doing their best, it is not their responsibility – it is the responsibility of Government to ensure that adequate housing exists to meet the needs of the people. If one looks at some of the election manifestos that have been touted over the past ten years, one will find plenty of references to meeting housing needs but no cases where the housing need has been met.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The response of the Government has been appalling and is highly unlikely to improve because the whole culture has been changed. We now have the emergence of new thinking where the rented accommodation is regarded as being much sought after. I have even heard this being touted as a positive thing. It is much sought after because living on the side of the road is the alternative. There are people living on the streets of this city. There are people in the province of Leinster who have to live in the open air. I have had to deal with one or two cases where young mothers and their babies have lived in the open air. It is extraordinary that this could have happened on the back of the Celtic tiger. Before now, I have never known it to happen in all my time in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">The duplex house is the most recent innovation to have been discovered. It is of no benefit to the tenant or person seeking a home, yet I have heard it being touted as the answer to Ireland's prayer. A duplex house is one house planted on top of another where there are outdoor stairways like those one would have seen leading to a grain loft in the old days. I hope this type of housing will be banned because that would eliminate the need for me to deal with the mothers of small children who visit my clinics to complain of injuries incurred by slipping on ice or being buffeted by the wind on the outdoor stairs. Such homes are entirely inconsistent with rural Ireland. Ireland is the least densely populated country in Europe and it must be asked why we would use such houses to solve our housing problems. If the Minister of State intends to do something for the people he should discontinue the construction of duplex housing. He should not presume that because we are from the country we do not understand such things. We are fully aware of them and know the effect they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">I do not see how the Bill will benefit those who cannot get affordable housing. While there have been people who have qualified for shared ownership or annuity loans over the past five years, the loan is often inadequate to buy a house and they remain on the list. When the possibility of an affordable house becomes available, the local authority assesses their income again to see if they can cut them off. It is a cynical exercise. The person may have qualified for a loan and then gone out and worked hard to earn more money to gather a deposit or do other things to achieve a home. Then the local authority changes the goalposts by lowering the income limits and disqualifies the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">While a number of issues need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency, the Bill is the ultimate in cosmetic surgery and has nothing to do with meeting housing needs. Unfortunately, this illustrates the serious problem of the ever-increasing growth of rented property. I refute the assertion that tenancy is the answer to our housing problems. Tenancy gives more power to big brother because the tenant must always be on the move. Tenancy has been put forward as a more economic means of housing people, but it is not. In my constituency the rent on an ordinary one-bedroom flat has risen to €800 per month in the past six years. That is the effect of the market. Other rental properties cost between €1,400 and €1,500 per month and the rent on some houses is €2,000 per month and more. Not all landlords are greedy. The majority are very good, have a conscience and take account of tenants' needs but the amount of high rent abuse is appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The margin on which the householder has to live is tiny when one takes into account the rent and the series of charges, including refuse charges, imposed by Government. I accept that these charges have to be made but the extent to which they are made and accelerated causes a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The Government recently discovered another means of hammering the poor unfortunate people who need a house. It is the development levy. There have always been development levies for water, sanitary services, roads and other services which councils might or might not provide to facilitate future development. In more recent times this levy has increased by multiples of five or six so that in some cases a home, either in town or country, is likely to incur a levy of €25,000 or €30,000. This is Government policy as enunciated through the local authorities and put into operation by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">How does the Government expect people to live or have a home of their own? It is obviously Government policy to ensure that they can never do so. At present it is estimated that a €300,000 house, of which there are not many, will incur a levy of €95,000 when one takes account of VAT, stamp duty and anything else the Government likes to take. The Government takes almost one third of the value of the house. This does not take account of the new levies, which will increase the Government's share even further.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Is the Minister of State shaking his head in disbelief? If so, he should speak to his party colleagues, who must have heard about the new development levies and the impact they will have on housing requirements.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan:</from>
          <p eId="para_59">This Bill has many beneficial aspects for tenants and landlords. One could hardly introduce legislation which would have the reverse effect. However, the sad fact is that it has been found necessary to introduce this legislation. Notwithstanding the merit of some elements of the Bill, it underlines the total abdication by Government of the housing area and the fact that Government is oblivious to the needs of the population, about 100,000 of whom the Government neither knows nor cares about. The Bill emphasises that future Government policy will be to ensure that we do not have a settled population to the same extent as in the past, that we have a more mobile population which can be moved around. This was the policy of the communists in the years following the Second World War when they pushed people into high-rise tower blocks whether they liked it and kept them there where they would be under state control. People lived in rented developments, they did not own their houses, would never own them and could never aspire to owning them. Their only salvation was to go to the Gulag.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">I hope the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will soon be visited by someone who will recognise the real housing needs of people and that we will move away from the present situation where housing is an unattainable luxury and the Government has no interest in doing anything about the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">His bitterness was clear in every utterance. He acknowledged that the Bill contained some welcome aspects but immediately moved to compare the situation in Ireland with communist countries following the Second World War. His bitterness was so evident that he could not deal with the item before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">He claimed that people cannot hope to own a home of their own. In 1993, 22,000 new houses were built. In 2004, the ESB figure for connections to new dwellings will be 66,000. The corresponding figure for 2003 is 62,000. These figures give the lie to what Deputy Durkan has said.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">His bitterness against this side of the House is so great that he could not join his colleagues in welcoming the Bill, as every speaker did unreservedly. Some speakers raised points they wished to debate and mentioned criticisms by interest groups, both owners and occupiers, and by organisations such as Threshold, but he could not welcome the Bill. He even attacked the Minister and said he hoped someone in the Department would recognise the real needs of people and deal with them. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, with his huge knowledge of inner-city difficulties and his experience of dealing with them is probably the best qualified person to be responsible for housing and urban renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">I compliment the Minister of State on introducing the Bill. He deserves credit, primarily because so many others have avoided this issue. Reasons have been given over many years for not dealing with it. Simple ones that spring to mind include the enshrining of the right to own property in the Constitution and the fear of tampering, which was always offered as a reason for not acting. There were many other issues involved, such as the commercial one, which led to the driving of people out of the rented market. The Minister of State has taken on these issues and has made a very good shot at rectifying the problems that exist by putting in place rules and regulations. The latter are badly needed because all the other problems associated with the difficulties and abuses of existing schemes have arisen due to the lack of regulation and control.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">It is correct to state that this is the first major Bill to deal with residential tenancies since the foundation of the State and probably long before that. It deals with many of the issues house owners and tenants will face, as well as many of the issues raised by representative groups such as Threshold, to which all speakers have referred, probably because it lobbied us all. It also deals with the concerns of many other smaller interest groups who try to care for the less well-off and who need accommodation. The questions of security of tenure and rent review must also be considered and regulations and guidelines have to be made to address them. These matters have been avoided for far too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">The Minister had to cross departmental lines when drafting the Bill. I am glad that he took the advice of the Attorney General when doing so because the last thing I want is legal challenges. These were threatened or referred to on occasions in the past year or two.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">It is important to point out that the Bill benefits both landlords and tenants. There are great benefits to those who provide rented accommodation and this is how it should be. People on all sides should get a fair deal. There is a tendency to take an extreme view in favour of one side or the other. Some refer to all landlords as money-grabbers, rackrenters, etc. Deputy Durkan stated they are trying to bleed the tenants of their last euro. However, the survey carried out in Dublin showed that 61% of all rented accommodation was owned by landlords with a single dwelling for rent. Of course there are landlords with many properties, but this statistic must be acknowledged. The landlords deserve the same respect and State protection as anybody else providing a service. I will refer later to some of the abuses that have taken place on both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Another extreme view is that all tenants are careless, negligent and do not want to pay their rent. This is incorrect. We need to realise the importance of the rented sector. It plays a massive role without which we could not cope. It is important, therefore, that we take a fair and balanced approach to it. Too often an extreme view is taken, which is of no help to anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Unlike other European countries, there has been a reluctance to recognise the need for rented accommodation in Ireland. This may be because of something in our psyche or because of our 800 years of occupation. There is some snobbery involved because in certain social groups one is asked if one is renting or purchasing. A view obtains that if one does not own one's own house, one is not of equal status to some others. This is rubbish. We should accept that there is a need for rented accommodation and help in every way possible in this respect. In Cork city, for example, there is a huge demand for rented accommodation on the part of a transient population linked to University College Cork, the Cork Institute of Technology, the major teaching hospitals, such as Cork University Hospital, and other facilities. We must meet this demand and do so in a proper fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">I do not like to see whole streets taken over simply for rental purposes. Sometimes this can lead to a ragged look, especially if landlords have not maintained their properties to a high standard. I hope this will be tackled in the Bill. The State and the private sector must make a joint effort to meet the needs that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">One difficulty in dealing with the residential tenancies issue arises because of the changing economic climate, particularly over the lifetime of this Government and its predecessor. It is a fact that up to the mid-1990s, we exported up to 40,000 people per year. We found proof of this at the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday when we dealt with the issue of the pre-1953 insurance stamps. Of the claims that were made – there were ten times more than expected – 50% were from the United Kingdom and only 33% were from this country. We effectively exported 67% of the claimants at one time or another. The trend was reversed in the mid-1990s and this created a difficulty in terms of planning for the then Government. The private building programme, which was then completing 22,000 new houses a year, will this year complete 62,000, although a figure of 58,000 was quoted. Last Monday, we had a briefing in the Cork region by the ESB, which has its homework done, and it stated it would be connecting 62,000 houses next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">There has been a radical change in the housing sector and, although one may complain about the nature of the change, it is a fact of life. An opportunity has been provided to young people to house themselves. In addition, local authority programmes are in operation. Various other groups must be considered and Deputy Durkan referred to one which I believe should receive more help, namely, the voluntary and co-operative sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I am involved with a very small group called Skiddy's homes, or Skiddy's charity, as it was originally called. It is the oldest charity in Ireland and the United Kingdom and it dates back 350 years. It is unique in that its bequest was to be divided equally between Catholic and Church of Ireland denominations. It provides 22 comfortable bungalows, mainly for elderly people without accommodation, for example housekeepers.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">I pay tribute to the work of the lady who ran the charity and who was its chairperson for the past 40 years, Mrs. Walls. Unfortunately, she died two months ago. She came from the minority section of the tenants but her leadership helped us provide the 22 bungalows. Many others would have similar drive, ability and leadership if they received assistance. I know the funding is available and we need to encourage this approach. I have no ideological hang-ups over the source of accommodation if it is suitable, of a good standard and affordable. We need to encourage this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Having accounted for various segments of the market, we are left with the most crucial sector, private rented accommodation. There may be a degree of snobbery at work in this regard – certainly there are constraints. We are unlike the Dutch and many other nationalities who rarely even consider owning property. They rent according to their needs which means a person might rent accommodation with two or three bedrooms and then move to a smaller place later in life. We must allow for the fact that we do not have this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The Minister has taken steps to rectify the matter of controls, which is one of the main difficulties in the rental market. On the commercial and business side of the market, regardless of whether one is a tradesperson seeking to rent a single room from which to work or a company seeking to rent a large complex, the system in place, including the legal framework, ensures one knows exactly what is expected of one, what one can or cannot do and the measures which will be taken if one steps out of line, whether legal action in the courts, fines or something else. People take this for granted, it is traditional. On the private rented side, however, there appears to be hang-up about having a similar system in place. The Minister of State is now addressing this issue in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">It is to be expected that aspects of the Bill will be criticised and alternative proposals will be made. I hope the work of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector has ironed out differences to the extent that the decisions made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, and implemented in the Bill, including the provision on the duration of rental contracts, will be pitched at the best possible level. While property owners and other representative groups will take different positions on this issue, we need to strike a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The commission was established with 18 members, which I considered a little unwieldy at the time. Although I did not believe it would work, with hindsight I now accept that the number of interests brought into play on this issue meant that the commission needed to have a wide degree of knowledge available to it. Its members have done a good job and I hope it will result in the successful administration of the provisions of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Various speakers criticised the rent subsidy scheme. Without wishing to wrong Deputy Durkan, I believe he referred to it in a scathing fashion. During my time as a member of a health board and a local authority, I dealt with this scheme on many occasions. Its introduction has been the single most important change in the rented accommodation market. It has had a major and positive impact on the market by allowing tens of thousands of people to avail of high-quality accommodation. Without it, these people would have had no hope of gaining access to such accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">In many instances, the rent subsidy scheme has provided shelter for young mothers who are left with little option other than to leave home for whatever reason. Before this scheme was introduced, many young mothers found themselves on the street or sharing a flat. It has also enabled people who are extremely unlikely to get local authority housing in many areas to get accommodation, including single males aged under the age of 55, a group referred to by Deputy Killeen. Of all the people on housing waiting lists, single males tend to have the lowest chance of getting accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The scheme has provided a source of income for people who let accommodation, some of whom are multiple owners. If all the conditions laid out in the Bill are met, we should have no complaint about this. As I stated, a survey has found that 61% of landlords in Dublin had single dwellings for rent. I presume a similar figure would apply elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">The criticism of the rent subsidy has ranged from the extreme and ludicrous to proposals for workable change, which probably should be accepted. Some people, including earlier speakers, argue that all funding under the scheme should go towards new housing. I have defended this scheme when members of parties from across the political spectrum made the same argument in the chamber of Cork City Council. Although the €30 million or thereabouts paid out under the scheme would build a certain number of houses, what would we do with the thousands of people availing of the subsidy? Would we put them out on the road? This argument is untenable because it would leave 97% of the people availing of the scheme destitute and without housing. The rent subsidy was introduced for people who are entitled to housing but cannot be housed by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Others, including Deputy Seán Ryan in his speech last night, argue that the scheme is being abused. My reply to them is simple. Abuse takes place across the spectrum, from schemes for business to social welfare. We should take action to rectify the abuse, rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water. When the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Coughlan, took action on this matter, she was fiercely criticised by Opposition speakers who stated the scheme was being abused. We should deal with the main form of abuse, which is rent increases by house owners I would be delighted if we could use social housing or social economy schemes to try to create some kind of purchase scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">Má smaoinítear ar stair na tíre, ar an easpa stádais a bhí ag tionóntaithe i gcónaí agus go raibh na cearta ar fad ar thaobh na dtiarnaí talún, tá sé do-chreidte gur seo mar atá cursaí ag an bpointe seo. Tá na cearta ar fad ag na tiarnaí talún go fóill agus tá roinnt mhaith droch thiarnaí talún sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">It is incredible and does not say much for successive Governments that the rights of the majority of tenants are virtually non-existent, by which I mean that the average tenant, who does not have security of tenure, can be evicted without reason from his or her home by a landlord. The legal position is that a landlord can serve a notice to quit, go to court and get rid of a tenant for no reason. It is in the context of bringing about change to this position that I welcome the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">A great deal has been written about this legislation since it was published, which I welcome because it has given much food for thought and has been a great guide to me in formulating my approach to the Bill. I am referring to people such as Fr. Séamus Murphy who has produced a position paper on the Bill. He refers to it as a tentative first step. I am also referring to groups such as Threshold. The introduction to its position paper on the Bill states:</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Threshold broadly welcomes the Bill published on 4 June 2003. However there are ambiguities, omissions and weaknesses in the Bill, which must be corrected if the legislation is to result in the promised "major and overdue advancement of tenants' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">That is what we must assess. There is no doubt that it is long overdue, but is it a major and significant advancement of tenants' rights? There is a danger that in its present form it is not but it could be if appropriately amended. Threshold suggests that one obvious way to make the legislation more effective is to include a general anti-avoidance provision to ensure that the acquired rights of tenants are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">There should also be obligations on landlords with regard to minimum legal standards. The chair of Threshold stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_100">A small minority of full time landlords are engaging in scaremongering and sensationalist arguments around this Bill in an attempt to undermine some of the fundamental rights enshrined in it. It's about time that people trying to make homes out of rented accommodation were not regarded as ‘income sources' who can be evicted with four weeks notice at the whim of an unscrupulous landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">While many landlords behave reasonably, it is essential that all should be made to do so if tenants, particularly the vulnerable 56,900 recipients of social welfare allowances, are to get a fair deal. I support that summary of Threshold's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">This Bill is long overdue. For decades there has been serious neglect of tenants in the private rented sector. The Government, in this Bill, is proposing a major reform of the law governing landlord-tenant relations in residential premises. I so not see my role on the Opposition backbenches as opposing measures for the sake of it. When I see something that is necessary and worthwhile, I support it and acknowledge the necessity for it. However, where it requires amendments or changes, I will argue strongly for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">The Irish tenant's lack of rights and legal protection should be a source of embarrassment to every Member of the House, and certainly to successive Governments, to the point of being shameful when compared to the tenant's status in other European Union jurisdictions. In that context, this Bill has been introduced not a moment too soon. There is a growing number of people, the majority of them poor, vulnerable and on the margins of society, whose vulnerability has increased due to the non-expansion of the public housing sector and the incredible house prices in this State. In the twice weekly property supplements, schemes are being advertised in which prices for houses start at €1.35 million. The average house price has been steadily increasing and is well over €300,000 in Dublin. Many people, therefore, are entirely dependent on the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Leases are normal at the expensive end of the rented sector. Such leases usually ensure a balance between landlords' and tenants' interests. In particular, a lease provides security of tenure for the duration of the lease. Security of tenure is what has been lacking in the rest of the private rented sector, where the great majority of the poorer and more vulnerable tenants are. The Bill can be seen as an attempt to provide security of tenure if only for a renewable four year period for tenants with six months continuous tenancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The all important factor in the private rented sector is security of tenure. If a landlord can evict a tenant more or less at will, as is the case at present, it follows that a tenant is in no position to resist, for example, demands for rent increases or infringements on other alleged rights of the tenant. If a landlord can get rid of a tenant for any or no reason, the tenant's other legal rights are largely irrelevant because the absence of security of tenure renders them ineffectual.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">In recent years tenants have acquired the legal right to a rent book. Travelling around Dublin one might not believe it but tenants also have a legal right to have the structure and exterior of the premises properly maintained by the landlord and, although I have raised many such cases at city council level, a legal right to certain minimum standards of sanitation and cooking and other facilities. The problem is that the landlord can make it clear to a tenant that any attempt to enforce such rights will be met with a notice to quit. I have seen this happen on many occasions in the centre of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">While a notice to quit does not of itself legally compel the tenant to vacate the premises, the message is clear. The tenant must put up with what they have or they will end up in court, where they have no protection. A landlord who goes to court to evict a tenant will invariably succeed in acquiring a court order for eviction by the sheriff. Knowing this to be the case, the tenant cannot fight for the above-mentioned rights since doing so might lead to loss of the tenancy, which would be self defeating. The harsh reality is that it is often not in the interests of the tenant to co-operate with the local authority, even when that authority is trying to protect the tenant's rights. The tenant knows that the landlord ultimately holds sway and has the courts on his or her side.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Approximately 82% of Irish dwellings are owner occupied. As a result, there is only a limited understanding of the plight of tenants in private rented accommodation. Many tenants do not know their rights and others are often in despair when they discover there is no way or protecting them. A tenant who lacks some reasonable measure of security of tenure is vulnerable to all sorts of illegal exploitation by landlords and cannot fight it. The State must step into the breach and change the law to ensure tenants can vindicate their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The objective thing would be to say the solution lies in an appropriate balance of rights and duties between landlords and tenants to ensure fairness. Even in that context there will always be unscrupulous landlords and obviously some irresponsible tenants. No law can guarantee that there will not be conflicts. What can be pursued, however, is a reasonable legal provision that allows tenants to hold their own against unscrupulous landlords and ensures effective redress against irresponsible tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">A tenant has a right to a home. A person who has no security of tenure for a reasonable period is not much better off than a person in a homeless shelter since he or she is always on the verge of homelessness. This is especially so if the tenant has dependent children. A tenant, therefore, should be able to exercise his or her rights. It is in the interest of good Government that both landlords and tenants be able to vindicate their rights. It is bad policy to assign legal rights to a category of people and then fail to ensure the exercise of these rights does not lead to loss of the very interest on which the rights in question are grounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">The obvious solution is legal provision to ensure that no tenant may be evicted where a court finds that, on the balance of probabilities, the landlord seeks possession arising from a desire for revenge against a tenant for demanding their rights or for drawing the local authority's attention to the fact that the landlord failed to register the premises, thereby breaking the law. The report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector proposed doing just that but the Bill does not provide for it. Failure to get to grips with the issue of registering is a major shortcoming in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">However, I want to be objective and refer to some of the Bill's positive elements before pointing out its weaknesses. Tenants in continuous possession of a premises for six months without receiving a notice to quit will be entitled to three and a half years security of tenure which, while fairly limited, is an advance on the current situation. This amounts to four years in all and renewable for further periods of four years. When established, the Private Residential Tenancies Board will be a second step forward with the power to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The board will be able to set up tenancy tribunals with the power to summon witnesses, hear evidence and determine cases. It will replace the District Court and small claims court in dealing with landlord-tenant disputes. There are weaknesses in all the aspects to which I will refer, but they are progressive steps forward in a limited sense. A third step forward is that rents cannot be set, whether at the beginning of the tenancy or in subsequent revision, at higher than the market value. Rent reviews shall not occur more than once a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I want to refer to the concept of the market rent because it is a major shortcoming in the Bill. The concept of a market rent is vague. The specialist powers the board will have may give it some effectiveness. Only time will tell how that concept of market rent can be exploited by landlords to their benefit and how effective the board can be in ensuring what is intended is what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Only time and experience will tell if the Government scheme will work. It would be foolish to think that one piece of legislation will reform the private rented sector once and for all. The Bill should be seen as cautious, limited reform. The Minister should study carefully the various position papers and analyses of the Bill. I have read four or five of these, all of which concentrate on certain aspects and certain weaknesses in the legislation. I am sure I will have an opportunity at a later stage when we attempt to amend the Bill to put greater emphasis on these weaknesses.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_46">
          <from>Mr. Finneran:</from>
          <p eId="para_115">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation and I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the Government on bringing it forward. Legislation to protect tenants has been discussed for the past 20 or 30 years but no one has taken the bold step to do something about the issue by providing protection in legislation. Different Governments over the years toyed with the idea but they did not bring forward the necessary legislation. The Minister of State is to be complimented on his initiative in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 is a milestone in the area of private rented accommodation. The general concept of housing in Ireland down through the years has been that people bought or built their own house. Approximately 80% to 85% of people lived in housing they owned themselves. This contrasted with other European countries where a far greater percentage of people lived in rented accommodation. In many jurisdictions there is protection in legislation for tenants and landlords. We must remember that there are two sides to every story. Therefore, any legislation must be balanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">It is generally accepted that, up to now, the balance was not in favour of tenants. They had little or no protection under the existing rules. Tenants were the poor partner in any arrangement entered into. Under this legislation protection for tenants is being written in law. They have the right to a four-year agreement, following an initial six-month probation period and the protection that rents cannot be increased except on an annual basis. There is also the Private Residential Tenancies Board on which has been conferred powers and functions, albeit of a limited nature, to resolve disputes. The way forward for many years has been to take every matter to the law courts. I am pleased the Government is moving away from that in a whole range of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">If we look at the other side of the coin to the insurance industry, the take of the legal profession has been a disgrace in that 40% of awards went to the coffers of the legal profession, thus driving insurance costs through the roof. Up to now tenants going to court had no protection but under this new arrangement they have enormous protection and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Much debate has taken place in recent years about the provision of housing and housing generally, whether in the public or private sectors. Ireland's housing market has been a phenomenal success with close on 60,000 houses being built in 2002. Apart from housing being made available to those who need it, the important issue is the social housing content. For every 100 houses built in any town in Ireland, 20% is available to the social housing programme, either by direct payment to the local authority or the provision of 20 sites or 20 houses. The reforming legislation is having a positive effect on the provision of housing, particularly for those in the social housing area.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">I have heard derogatory comments on the housing market and what is being provided. As one who has kept my feet on the ground over the years, through the local authority system, I see a massive change in the type of accommodation available to those who, in the past, would have been classed as local authority tenants, people who would go on local authority lists and wait to be housed. Year after year the local authority of which I was a member built 20 to 30 houses annually while there were 500 on the list. This made no attempt to address the serious housing problem. Thankfully we are moving towards a resolution of that issue. On the local authority side we are building 100 plus houses annually and under the social housing programme that number is being quadrupled. That is the type of approach I am pleased the Government has overseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">During the 25 years I have been a member of Roscommon County Council we have not been allocated the same grants from Government that were allocated in 2002 and 2003 towards public housing. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, on securing this funding from Government and allocating it to the much needed local authority schemes which remained on the shelves for many years. It is obvious that his own experience at local authority level in Dublin played a major part in his thinking. I compliment him on his positive intervention in the whole area of housing, social and affordable housing and local authority housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Recently there has been some debate on rent relief and rent subsidy. It is a good scheme and one that must be maintained. I agree with some of the statements that it gives an unrealistic lift to the cost of rental accommodation. That needs to be addressed, but certainly the scheme must be maintained. It is the only major protection, particularly for young mothers who may have to leave with a child or several children. This scheme enabled them to get into decent accommodation. In circumstances such as that there was little or no protection if they had to go on the open market. They were never the first choice of landlords because they did not have the financial wherewithal or experience of the rental market and ended up in sub-standard accommodation. The rent scheme allowed them to get properties in the private sector market. That scheme will have to be maintained in a manner that gives the necessary protection and an opportunity to those end up on the street, following whatever disputes or problems have arisen to cause them to leave home and seek alternative accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">There are two sides to every agreement. The Irish Property Owners Association has some reservations about the legislation. It was deeply involved and played a positive role in the discussions at the commission on rental accommodation. I understand it has a representative on the <i>ad hoc</i> private residential tenancies board. From the information available to me the Irish Property Owners Association practically signed up to the recommendations of the commission but sees anomalies and changes that were not included in the report. Much that it signed up to in that comprehensive package was not palatable to property owners compared with what they had been accustomed to in the past. Having said that, the association signed up to it and had included in the package the whole area of letting of residential accommodation, given that they are involved in the same tax treatment and reliefs as other businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">That is very important and its position should be no different from that of any other business. It points out that the one-size-fits-all approach may not be the most appropriate measure and says this would not be the case in any other European state. It adds that there are tenants who would like flexible arrangements. Have the Minister of State or his officials looked at that question, or is there a need for further discussion on whether there can be any provision for such people? I am neither well enough versed in, nor do I know enough about, that area to comment with any authority on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The association also raises the issue of the troublesome tenant, about which I do know a little. How much protection is there in this Bill to deal with such a person? I know of many cases in my constituency where the local authority had to deal with this and found it very difficult to address anti-social behaviour in housing estates. We cannot ignore this problem and previously the local authority was not in a position to address it successfully. I would appreciate a comment on this from the Minister of State, either at the end of the Second Stage debate or at the end of one of the later Stages. He might outline how he sees this position differing from the structures available to the local authority system at present. Does he feel that there is enough protection there for the landlord and for other tenants who may be in that block, house or whatever? These are simply a few of the concerns that have been raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">This legislation, however, is very welcome and it brings the tenant and residential letting and housing in the private sector into the 21st century. It will be particularly helpful in the social and affordable housing area where it has a welcome knock-on effect. If we are to move, as we seem to be moving, towards a position where private rented accommodation will become part of people's housing needs in the future, it is important that we have sufficient safeguards, checks and balances in the Bill. This is a milestone in that area. As I know from my own family and many others with whom I have contact, people today want to have the flexibility in the early years when they are climbing the career ladder to be able to move at fairly short notice. Many such people do not consider buying a home at an early stage. It is important that this type of legislation is enacted but it is also important that there is a flexible arrangement for these people. That is one of the points which the Irish Property Owners Association has brought to my attention. Maybe the Minister of State will comment on that at the end of this Stage or some other Stage of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">It goes without saying that many landlords in the past have not met decent standards or even a moral obligation in the properties they have rented and the way they have treated tenants. It is sad to have to say that but that was, and probably still is, the case for some unscrupulous landlords. It is vitally important that this type of legislation exists to ensure that such people do not get away with abusing the rental sector by leaving people in poor or unhealthy accommodation. Happily, as a result of what is happening here that will change, there will be protection and landlords will have to conform to minimum standards and tenants will get their entitlements, whether in sanitary or cooking arrangements, or whatever else is necessary, and have some sort of tenure. Four years is a reasonable period.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister of State and the Government on their initiative. In the past 20 or 30 years many Governments have talked about this but have not brought forward the necessary legislation. Now we have it and it will protect tenants and provide a forum for dealing with disputes. It is a major step forward and will stand the test of time but, if not, any anomalies or difficulties that arise can be dealt with at a later stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_47">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_129">Tá áthas orm go bhfuil seans agam labhairt faoin mBille seo. Tá tábhacht ag baint leis. Maidir leis an reachtaíocht tá sé soléir, ní hamháin go bhfuil sé ag teastáil ach go bhfuil géar riachtanas leis. Chomh maith leis sin tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh na forálacha leathan agus iomlán agus níl sin éasca. Tá Páirtí an Lucht Oibre sásta glacadh leis mar chéad chéim.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this legislation and the attitude of the Labour Party is that it is a first step. We support it on Second Stage as my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, said and we will put down several amendments on Committee Stage which we hope will bring the legislation along. The concept of a housing market is included in the Bill in so far as it refers to the establishment of a rent in terms of the market. I have difficulty with the calculation of this because section 24(1) defines "market rent" as one which:</p>
          <p eId="para_131">the willing tenant not already in occupation would give and a willing landlord would take for the dwelling in each case on the basis of vacant possession having regard to–</p>
          <p eId="para_132">(<i>a</i>) the other terms of the tenancy terms, and</p>
          <p eId="para_133">(<i>b</i>) the letting values of dwellings of a similar size, type and character to the dwelling and situated in a comparable area to that in which it is situated.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">This is a fairly unqualified definition of "market rent". It is interesting that it departs from other legislative uses historically. For example, the original tenant purchase schemes introduced in the 1970s took account of length of tenancy and so forth. The Bill does not refer to non-market conditions, as it were. This raises a point which needs consideration which I bring up by way of being helpful when it comes to housing legislation, namely that the Bill does not take account of the life cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Many references have been made to the European private rental sector market. Even accepting the concept of the market where it exists, the European private rental sector market accepts and acknowledges the changing nature of tenancy through the life cycle. The concept of a probationary period of six months followed by three and a half years' security to be followed in turn by a further four year period could be interpreted by the unscrupulous as giving a landlord the right to keep controlling the kind of tenant wanted. It would give a very limited version of security to the tenant <i>in situ</i> and in compliance with most of the conditions through the life cycle. If we are to move towards a regulated rental sector that enjoys the security of the European model, it must have a consideration of life cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">While I hope we will have other opportunities of discussing housing in general and do not want to stray from the terms of this legislation, general points have been made by previous speakers about the volume of supply, as it were, into the housing market, which in turn, it is assumed, translates into the volume available in the private residential rental sector. I question some of these assumptions. It is appropriate to put on record what is happening in the private rental sector and, for example, to examine the proportion of gross and disposable income for which rent accounts. Reference was made to young people seeking accommodation in Dublin city. I do not view with great credibility the figure of 61% of landlords having a single dwelling. I would like to see this figure re-examined. It certainly does not relate to Galway city, where I live.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">As for those on starter incomes in Dublin city, from my information and my experience in talking to people, I know of no case where the monthly rental income is less than 35%. It is usually above 40% of gross income. I can put that in real terms. Young professionals are on starter incomes of about €24,000, and there are no single occupancy dwellings available in Dublin city centre for less than €800 per month. It is not rocket science to work out the proportion of rental income to gross income. I am deliberately not picking lower salaries even though a great number of people are on salaries lower than the one I mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">People may suggest that one can find this here and that there in Dublin, but I do not have the time in this contribution to discuss all that. If one goes down that road, as many do, one then starts calculating social time, beginning with the time spent travelling to work. I have a view on what is happening in housing and I am encouraged to say a little more, as elaboration is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">When I started out in university as a young lecturer without security of tenure, it was difficult to get a mortgage. A loan was given at about two and a half times one's gross income. As I say, I am encouraged to discuss this because people may want to question some of the figures I am using. I can give accurate figures, some of them based on my own experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">When I was a young lecturer it was possible in Ireland, and is not possible now, for a person to get married and rear a family on a single income. Most of us who were progressive agitated for the right of both partners to be in the work force if they so chose. Now there is no choice. Mortgage slavery began to get worse. There are people who like that. A retired senior civil servant told me less than two years ago at the official opening of a museum that he thought it great that his children would pay more than €250,000 for a house. I had a good hard look at him, because what has happened in the housing market has torn the heart out of the economy. This man was one of those people who enjoyed a very large income and wanted to earn a great deal more after he had officially retired. He saw nothing wrong with speculation in the housing market. I see a great deal wrong with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">I would like to discuss housing legislation more generally but I have a number of important things to say about the legislation before us and want to make it clear that my views are not abstracted. I refer to a time in Ireland when people were free to exercise a choice to have a relationship with their families and so forth. It was also a time when people could return from work before seven or eight o'clock and have time for participation in their community. That does not happen any more. It was a time too when one did not have to start early in the morning and look for a place for one's children in a country which is not committed to child care. If people suggest there is something wonderful that must not be interfered with regarding speculation in housing, that is not true. There is a lot wrong with such speculation.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">People on both sides of this argument should also remain calm regarding law. There is no absolute right to property in this country. Mr. Justice Kenny established that. If the kind of legislation on the cost of building land proposed by my own party and voted down twice had passed into law, it would have had the effect of reducing the gross price of a house by about 30% to 50% minimum.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">There is another side to this. I now see a new stage where people coming to retirement age and to a certain stage of their own mortgage commitments have to enter into a second level of indebtedness to keep the racket going, for racket it is. I accept that people say that 61% of landlords with houses to rent in Dublin have only a single dwelling. That is the figure being quoted. I would like to know more about that. I would like to see an analysis of who is buying houses from plans. In Galway city, where I know the facts, people buy property by recycling rents, powerfully assisted by the changes in the taxation code.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The contributors to this debate on the Government side ignored the life cycle aspect and the impact of seasonal factors. How is the market to be established under section 24 if seasonal factors are reduced as grounds? Galway, Cork and Waterford cities as well as other places are relevant in this regard. In Galway city there is a student population present for part of the year. Where there are hospitals, there are nurses and doctors. There is a tourist factor and so on. I refer to these because I can see people driving a coach and four through section 24.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The Minister of State may agree with me on housing speculation. If we have no difficulty about accepting the 61% figure, then I suggest that the figures be published when the registration is complete and we will see who owns what and the circumstances of that ownership, in which market and under what conditions. I genuinely welcome this legislation as a first step. I am not underestimating any of the difficulties that may arise. Among the difficulties that arise is that there is not an unqualified right to property in the Irish Constitution as interpreted by judicial decision. As I understand it, there is, unfortunately, no right to shelter, except in the European legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I wish to tease out the different rights to shelter, the right to make a home out of rental accommodation. Is there such an aspiration? When did it happen that one's right was defined solely in terms of ownership? Is there not something about the nature of the Republic and its Constitution if one has an absolute right to own something but no absolute right to shelter if one is homeless and no right to security of accommodation if one is renting? These are not academic matters, they are matters to do with the debate about rights-based legislation with regard to housing and sooner or later they will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I hope at a future date to write in more detail about the mentality of those who took some of the largest salaries from the State, decided then to half dump themselves on the half State, then go on to the fully commercial sector and then, for good measure, set up a kind of defence of the speculative role in housing. At the moment I am being strictly parliamentary by leaving it at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">If we are to be realistic about housing, the real test is to ask what proportion of one's gross and disposable income per month is given for accommodation costs in the rental sector. Is this disassociated from the rise in the cost of housing, both first-time and second-hand housing? It is not disassociated from it. I would be glad to be proved wrong in my belief that the concept of market value for rent is inexorably connected to the cost of housing. There has been a slight drop in rents in the private sector in Dublin in the past 12 months, but taken over a five year period or longer, there is an established connection. In a six year period the cost of housing in Dublin has risen more than 200%. It is nine times the rate of the increase in inflation, five times the increase in earnings and four times the cost of building. That is a significant contributory factor. This is behind the interpretation of market value.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">There is another set of problems. The right of renewal cuts across the legitimate expectation of responsible tenants who are secure and looking forward, beyond the period of four years. It is perfectly understandable that there are people who are not sucked into the ownership syndrome and who may want to remain as responsible tenants. I believe there is a genuine attempt in this legislation to move towards a model of responsible tenancy where the responsible tenant is an asset when a property is being sold. At the moment the right of renewal as expressed is out of kilter with what exists, for instance, in German legislation. I question the probationary period of six months. That is capable of being abused. If the decision regarding the appropriate rent is to be based on what a willing tenant would pay for vacant possession and what a landlord is willing to accept, why is this so different from what is used as the model for rent subsidy?</p>
          <p eId="para_150">In Galway city, I am dealing with several cases in my advice centres where, because of the capping of the rent subsidy, people have been told that their accommodation is too expensive. The problem is that there are no cheaper units available. I have been in Galway for about 20 years and this is a side of the Galway rental market I have missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Reference was made to section 16(<i>m</i>) and the notion that the tenant must inform the landlord of somebody who is staying in the accommodation with him or her. I will not dwell on the more exotic interpretations of that section, as have other speakers. I suggest that, for example, if there was a death in a family and somebody wished to stay with the tenant during a period of grieving, the tenant should not be under an obligation to tell the landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">I regard as extraordinary the provision that if a baby is born the terms are automatically dislodged with regard to the number of beds on offer in the rental accommodation. Contrary to some speakers, I think Part 4 of the Bill is a genuine attempt to define anti-social behaviour and is to be welcomed. I agree that if this legislation is to work, the procedures must be both speedy and adequately resourced, as is the case with the Small Claims Courts. Anti-avoidance clauses and legal compliance will depend on the quality of the orders made by the Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Breen:</from>
          <p eId="para_154">I do not intend to speak for 20 minutes so there will be ample time for the Minister of State to reply on this important debate. I welcome the Bill, as does the Fine Gael Party. It is a long overdue development in housing legislation. Fine Gael has been calling for Government action in light of the significant changes in the housing situation, particularly as a result of the Celtic tiger economy of the 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Deputy Gregory referred to the fact that 82% of those housed are owner-occupiers, which is a very high percentage of ownership. Ownership of houses is much lower in Europe. The pattern of housing has changed with the development of urban sprawls. The need for reform of the private rented sector has long been recognised. The Bill is published against the background where the percentage of the housing stock available for rent has risen from 8% to 13%. This percentage increase is all the more noticeable because of the rise in the total number of units.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Exorbitant house prices are a feature throughout the country, including in my constituency, where a three or four bedroom house costs well over €200,000, a huge amount of money. There are many absentee landlords who have bought multiple houses for letting, creating problems for those who would like to buy and leaving the rental sector as the only realistic option for them. Home ownership is the ultimate goal for many people but they have to put it off to a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The Government's record in housing is poor. Before the budget last year, the first-time buyer's grant was abolished, a huge blow to many couples. Fine Gael collected over 100,000 signatures in opposition to this measure from those who were put out because the grant was abolished. Now development charges are being introduced, placing even heavier burdens on young people who want to build houses, adding between €8,000 and €9,000 to the cost of a house in a rural area.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The average house price in Dublin is €300,000 and in my constituency it is well over €250,000. At least 100,000 people are paid a rent subsidy by health boards and tenants enjoy little security of tenure. Many policy decisions on housing were framed on the basis of poor information and the latest Estimates add to the situation by stipulating that tenants must be living in a house for six months before receiving a subsidy, making the situation for many people intolerable. The <i>Housing Statistics Bulletin</i> stated that 5,581 people are homeless and if one walks the streets of Dublin, one will see many homeless people. There is also evidence that homelessness exists in areas outside Dublin – people are sleeping rough in Ennis.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The Bill is the only decent measure the Government has introduced in housing in the past seven years. Fine Gael views the Bill in light of the need for proper recognition of rights and responsibilities. We understand that a vibrant rental sector that is attractive as a medium-term option is vital to the economy. We must ensure the rental sector is fair to landlords to boost supply as well as fair to tenants to maintain demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Some changes will be necessary on Committee Stage. The composition of the Private Residential Tenancies Board should be spelt out clearly in section 147. The board is central to ensuring the spirit of the Bill is adhered to and that neither tenants nor landlords can abuse perceived loopholes in it. The Minister is free to choose whom he wants as long as they are deemed to have adequate experience in the area and there is an equitable balance between men and women on the board. That will not ensure a balance between the interests of landlords and tenants. The Fine Gael spokesman on the environment, Deputy Allen, has proposed a balance of five landlord, five tenant and five impartial representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Section 148(2) allows the Minister to make subjective decisions to remove a member of the board at any time. This grants him great power over the functions of an independent group, a variance from what is expected from the legislation. Coupled with section 192, the Minister has effective control to rewrite the day-to-day workings of the Bill subject to his own interpretation.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">Section 125 of the Bill refers to the publication of the register, but it will not contain information on the identity of landlord or tenant or the amount of rent payable. Full taxes are not paid on rental income by some property owners and this Bill does not address that. Students often pay rent to middle men who demand cash to avoid paying tax. The Bill, with some changes and hard work, will be a giant step forward in this area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_51">
          <from>Mr. Ferris:</from>
          <p eId="para_164">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and will address a number of issues regarding its content. The changes in eligibility for rent supplement will cause serious hardship for many people in the private rented sector. The changes in rent allowances, announced in the Estimates, are reckless and will have a catastrophic effect on the most vulnerable, such as unemployed people living in private rented accommodation for less than six months and for those whose accommodation is linked to their employment. Such people will lose their job and home.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Ministers cannot even agree on whether rent supplement is a housing measure. On Wednesday morning, the Taoiseach failed to answer a question from my party colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, on the following matter. During a debate in the Dáil last week on a Sinn Féin Bill to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, vigorously defended the Government's housing record by stating: "The general strategy for realising the overall housing policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves with the aid of available fiscal incentives, and those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing." Two days later the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, when announcing the changes to the eligibility criteria for rent supplements stated that rent supplement is "not a housing measure". The Taoiseach was unable to tell Deputy Ó Caoláin which Minister was correct – the Minister of State with responsibility for housing who claims rent supplement is a housing measure when he needs to patch up this Government's scandalous housing record or the Minister for Social Welfare who says it is not a housing measure when she needs to excuse a housing cutback which hits the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">This cut will have a real and damaging effect on those attempting to leave abusive homes, single parents and those stuck in grossly over-crowded situations which have been condemned by Threshold and others such as the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland, One Parent Exchange and Network, the Irish Refugee Council, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, Age Action, Children's Rights Alliance and Cherish. How can this Government not see the dire consequences of this decision?</p>
          <p eId="para_167">It is outrageous that it should choose to attack rent allowances again this year. The cap on rents at €107 for those in receipt of rent supplement will also cause great hardship because it is virtually impossible to find accommodation which costs less than that per week. It is pushing landlord and tenant agreements under ground and will force people to falsify documents, with the aid of landlords, to indicate that they are paying less than €107 per week for their accommodation. What this provision will do is to force decent, hardworking people, those caught in the poverty trap, to criminalise themselves in order to obtain accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">This Government has done nothing about the housing crisis during its term in office. This measure will, I have no doubt, bring about an increase in homelessness because the most vulnerable people will find they cannot get into the private rented sector. For some the choice could be one of remaining in a violent home or living on the street. People caught in abusive and violent homes will tolerate such circumstances rather than become homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">As my party colleagues stated, Sinn Féin welcomes many of the provisions contained in this Bill. There is no getting away from the fact that it is deeply flawed in its failure to address the issue of fair rent. Security of tenure provisions will be compromised because a person living in the private rented sector for four years will be liable to eviction without reason in the first six months of his or her second tenure.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_170">I thank Members for their comments. There has been great interest in the Bill with more than 50 Members contributing to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">While the Bill, which is based on the commission's report, strikes a fair balance, I am open to people's views and detailed matters can be examined on Committee Stage. There has been a positive reaction to this Bill inside and outside the House. One of the values of having it published during the summer was that it enabled great debate on it outside this House, as many Members have acknowledged. We now have the views of concerned people on both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">There has been some criticism of the Bill but most people have been fair and balanced in their views. People recognise it is a step forward. The reforms provided for will have a positive effect in terms of promoting harmony, stability, professionalism and investment, something which is extremely important, despite what some say, in the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Members have made some very sound points and political ones also. Others have made some off-the-wall points. Deputy Durkan is not present and, while I regard him as a nice man socially, some of the comments he made this morning were off-the-wall. Twenty minutes later I am still unsure whether it was landlords or tenants he supported. I generally listen and do not interrupt but much of what Deputy Durkan had to say was so off-the-wall I could spend my 15 minutes replying to him alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Some Members have criticised the Government for being slow to provide local authority and social housing, yet many of them served on local authorities until recently. Some local authorities have been pathetic in delivering houses. It is easy to say the Government should allocate the money to provide such houses. The Government has provided the money by way of a four year multi-annual programme. I could embarrass many people. Deputies were members of local authorities which received money for the provision of houses during the last four years, yet many of them built only half what they intended to build. Rather than slagging me off, people should, through their local councillors, put pressure on local authority management to deliver what they are required to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Deputy Brendan Smith and others made an interesting point this morning about elderly emigrants. A number of local authorities try to ensure that senior citizen accommodation is provided to such people. A current Member of this House is an active member of a housing association which concentrates on that area. It is right that we should take care of emigrants returning from abroad after 50 years. The pre-1953 social welfare scheme mentioned this morning received much criticism in recent times from some of the liberal media complaining that expenditure has worked out at far more than we expected. That is correct and I do not apologise for that. Many emigrants who left Ireland in 1954 or 1955, who have not worked here for six or seven years and who sent money home during their years abroad, live in very limited circumstances. It is a good that, following 50 years, we are paying them a half pension under the pre-1953 provision. I do not apologise for doing so. Of course other people who do not need the allowance have claimed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Many Members raised the issue of rent regulation. The commission examined that matter and felt that rent control had many disadvantages and that market rent was the way to go. We can discuss that again later.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Those of us on the Government side have been trying to concentrate on the supply aspect. A good supply of rented accommodation ensures that market rents are more reasonable. Deputy English said last night that there are houses in his constituency which cannot be let, and I heard what Deputy Michael Higgins said on that. I have met at least two landlords in my constituency over recent weeks who complained to me that this year they failed to let the houses they would normally let to students. I did not shed too many tears for them, so be it, but it will be good to get to a stage where supply equals demand because it will allow people to look for better standards of accommodation. We all know that in recent years when there was a shortage of supply, some landlords took advantage of that and demanded very high rents even though they were providing inferior quality accommodation. If the balance goes the other way, I will not shed too many tears but I do not want to see a situation where there is over-supply and no demand. We want to try to get some balance in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Rents have come down a good deal in Dublin in the past 18 months. Rents that were €2,000 a month are probably down to €1,600 or €1,700 and those that were €1,600 are down to €1,400. Rents of €1,200 per month are probably still at that price because the rent allowance or whatever is acting as too much of a support. Supply and demand are coming into equilibrium and I welcome that because we will be able to do far more in terms of standards when that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Local authorities have been very lax regarding standards and indeed registrations. I was a member of a local authority when that system was brought in – I believe Deputy McManus was Minister of State at the time. I saw it as a huge revenue source for the local authority I was on at the time but it has not become that because local authorities, for whatever reason, did not see the benefit of chasing landlords for what was then the £40 per unit. There is a reasonable number of houses registered in some local authorities – Dublin and Galway – although one large county, which I will not name, has only one registered let house. That is a joke.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_181">Local authorities have failed to impose the standard and they have failed to bring in the revenue. That is difficult to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I would like to clear up a misunderstanding about penalties for non-registration. There will be a double fee of €140 for late registration. That is not a fine but some people appear to have confused it with the penalties for non-registration which are much higher. If a landlord is convicted of the offence of not complying with a requirement to register, the penalty will be a fine of up to €3,000 or six months imprisonment. The late registration fee and the sentence for nonregistration are two different aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">At the outset I mentioned some provisions on data exchange. They remain to be added on Committee Stage. Some Deputies raised the issue of access to data by the Revenue Commissioners. I want to stress that there is no question of information being kept from the Revenue Commissioners. That is not my intention. The details of the data provisions to be included on Committee Stage are being finalised and they will be available. They are likely to enable registration data to be provided to the Revenue Commissioners on a case by case basis where required. However, the Revenue does not require us to put such a clause into legislation because its powers generally are dealt with in taxation legislation and any wider power that might be considered necessary for the Revenue Commissioners to access data on rented accommodation would be a matter for consideration in the context of such legislation. In addition, a Revenue powers group is examining all those aspects and it may seek extra data from us. I assure the House I will have no problem in getting the tenancies board to supply necessary data to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Many speakers mentioned the six months tenancy period. This issue was discussed at length here and in the commission and it is easy to make a case either way. It was a judgment call by the commission which recommended it as a balanced period. I am not suggesting that logical arguments cannot be made, and I am sure they will be made again on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">A number of speakers mentioned, and Deputy Gilmore suggested, that landlords might terminate tenancies during the six months probation period to get higher rent from new tenants. That does not make sense because under the Bill the landlord can seek the full market rent from an existing tenant at a yearly review. That is the maximum that will be paid. There is no value in a landlord trying to get one tenant out and another in who might be an unknown quantity when the rent they get is the same. I do not see the logic of that and we should not put out misinformation in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">A number of other points were raised which I will not have time to deal with, but mention was made of the SWA rent supplement scheme which provides income support through the welfare system for eligible persons who are unable to afford rent. Rent supplement claimants will benefit from the reforms in this Bill in the same way as other tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">It is important to refer to what has been said in recent weeks because there has been some comment on that. From a housing perspective, I am concerned that some of those comments may have caused unnecessary fears. Most commentators appear to have ignored the assurances given by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, when announcing these changes. The details of these measures fall to be specified in regulations which will be brought forward by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The Minister reinforced those assurances in the House this week. For example, she stated specifically that there would be exceptions for the homeless and people at risk of becoming homeless, and that nobody would be made homeless because of the changes, but we all live in the real world. We all move around our constituencies and we know what is happening in terms of rent allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">This is a very necessary measure which has been of great benefit over the years but there are almost 60,000 people on rent supplement. We talked about the cap introduced last year which was intended to keep a lid on things but this year alone the cost of rent allowance increased by €76 million, a 30% increase. That does not make sense. It is obvious that many people are using the rent allowance facility but how can we look at a spend of an extra €76 million this year? We are now giving approximately €330 million as a subsidy to landlords which in some cases is for very low quality accommodation. We know the system is being abused and now there is greater supply, much of which in the past year has gone to rent allowance people who, in many cases, were adequately housed but who availed of the opportunity because accommodation is now available. We cannot justify a 30% increase in one year and it is reasonable that some measure be taken while ensuring that genuine people are looked after. That is what we are trying to do here.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I have made no secret of the fact, even in my own constituency, that the State and the taxpayer is ploughing a fortune into the regeneration of certain areas like Ballymun and inner city areas. A key part of that was to ensure a social mix in Ballymun. We wanted to bring in private tenants to provide a social mix, because up to now there were 6,000 units of local authority housing and suddenly all these private apartments were being occupied by people on rent allowance. Where is the social mix? I am concerned about this and I make no secret of the fact that I have asked whether we can limit the number of people on rent allowance in areas where there are already too many.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">It has been an interesting discussion. I could keep on talking about this for hours because the problem with listening to the contributions of about 50 Members is that many points are made and I cannot answer all of them. However, we can consider them again on Committee Stage. I was a bit upset at some of the comments of the Irish Property Owners Association. I want this legislation to be balanced, not strongly in favour of one side. As I said in my opening speech, during my life I have been both a tenant and a landlord, although I am currently neither, so I hope I am being balanced. I would prefer if this Bill had been introduced a couple of years ago. I look forward to Committee Stage, on which we can consider these points in more detail. Many points were made about our housing programme, investment and so on and I have good answers for all of them so I am sorry I do not have time to go into more detail. I thank all the Members and everyone who was involved in the preparation of this Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Mr. Killeen:</from>
          <p eId="para_193">People on all sides acknowledge that the national task force on medical staffing was made up of eminent medical experts. It is probably at this stage that any agreement dissipates – there is certainly not a lot after that. The point was made in the report that the task force took no account of industrial relations issues or political considerations. This is presented as a positive thing, but anyone who has had the opportunity of considering the report will have come to the conclusion that it is one of the negative aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">To be fair, the task force was required to present its report against the background of the European Working Time Directive, the unacceptably long hours worked by non-consultant hospital doctors, considerable publicity around waiting lists and other weaknesses in the health system and the expenditure of €9.3 billion annually, which is more than the full income tax take in the State. It was presented with a difficult job. However, despite the constraints and the difficult background, much of what is contained in the report is positive. Such negatives as there are can be worked through by the project teams. It is true that in the case of one of the pilot regions – the mid-west – it is not at all clear what criteria were used in designating whether hospitals should be general or local. That is a sticking point for Ennis, because on further examination of the report it does seem that Ennis meets the criteria for a general hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I find it extraordinary that so many consultants, GPs and medical personnel are now vehemently opposed to the report, despite the fact that members of their own representative bodies were the very people who drew it up. The task force claims to have consulted widely, but that is not the view of people in the two pilot regions and in Ennis and Nenagh. If the level of consultation I am told about is correct, it was certainly not enough and people are quite right to complain about its quality. The task force people will say they offered the opportunity of consultation and it was not taken up. There is also a dispute about the number of people dealt with in the accident and emergency unit of Ennis General Hospital. The figure provided by the task force was 15,000, while the annual report of the health board says there were more than 22,000. This is a major discrepancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The Hanly report says there are two consultant cardiologists in the mid-west, but as far as anybody there is aware, there is only one. Certainly, when one considers the study's <i>modus operandi</i> and the fact that 350,000 is the designated population for a region, it does seem that an area with a population of more than 100,000 ought to qualify for general hospital status. It must also be pointed out that Ennis hospital has a wonderful record. More than 95% of people who present at the accident and emergency unit are dealt with without ever going elsewhere – they are either dealt with on the spot or admitted. The number of acute medical admissions, excluding geriatrics, is running at more than 2,500 per year, or 50 per week, which is a substantial number.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">There are grave concerns at Ennis hospital and in the area about the proposals for accident and emergency services, which I share. I raised these concerns on day one with Mr. Hanly when he outlined what was involved in the report. On the other hand, some of those who have spoken on the issue have been extraordinarily alarmist. There is grave concern among hospital staff that the hospital's reputation is being damaged and undermined by some of the comments. This makes it hard for those of us who are serious about having the best level of service to address these difficulties. It is important that we obtain a good outcome from this report and from the Minister, Deputy Martin.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">There is unanimous agreement in Clare, in the health board and right across the region that the case for including 24-hour accident and emergency services in both Nenagh and Ennis is well established. I urge the Minister to include the upgrading of accident and emergency services when he announces the development plan for Ennis hospital soon. The arguments about the distance of people from the hospital, the proximity of Shannon Airport, the industrial base in the area, the requirements of the national spatial strategy and the fact that Ennis is one of the fastest growing towns in the country, are all well known and it is quite clear that they were not properly taken account of in the preparation of the task force report.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The lessons of history suggest that the Hanly report could replace the Fitzgerald report as a template for health service development. The latter was completed in 1968 and was formally revisited two or three times in the mid-1970s and again in the mid-1980s. It was never quite adopted but has always hung over the development of services, making it difficult in the areas which were under review. I have taken a look back at various studies. The 1928 Government commission and 1933 hospitals commission were strongly critical of the small county hospitals on the grounds of inefficiency and unsafe practice. However, the people have long since voted with their feet. They have used the services of the local hospitals because they believe them to be top class. More and more, particularly over the last ten years, people have come to the view that the services in Ennis hospital are up there with the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">For the record, Mr. Fitzgerald did not even propose a regional hospital in Limerick. He proposed two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway. He wanted 12 general hospitals and said that Ennis hospital should have its role changed to that of a community health centre. At least in the Hanly report there is a stronger emphasis on the development of hospital services in Ennis and there is to some degree a template for going forward. However, unless the project team examining this in the mid-west, along with the others involved, reject the proposal for 24-hour accident and emergency services and ensure that the service is provided, this report will not be acceptable. It can be done relatively easily. I have also seen figures which suggest that it can be done much more cheaply than is proposed in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The report sets enormous challenges for the development of health services in areas such as the provision of equipment and personnel for ambulance services and the recruitment of consultants. It goes some way towards addressing costs. Doing nothing is not an option. The deadline for the working time directive is closing in and there is no doubt that changes must be made. Everyone that has looked at this acknowledges that the only prospect of addressing the difficulties within the timescale of the working time directive is to improve services at all hospitals, including Ennis and Nenagh. This can only happen if they are retained as acute hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Unless a clear outcome is reached quickly on the mid-west and eastern region, the Hanly report will replace the Fitzgerald report and will hang negatively over the health service. We need to establish exactly what can and should be done. We must accept that the experience in accident and emergency departments in large hospitals is extremely negative for everybody using the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">We need to face up to the implications outlined on page 118 of the task force report on capital costs. The State is not in a position to provide the funding that would be inevitable in capital terms alone were the Hanly report to be proceeded with. The State is certainly not in a position to provide the alternative services proposed within the timescale indicated. It is not in anybody's interest to do this at any stage. The implications of this part of the report, where it is made clear a number of costs are excluded, must be examined carefully by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The project team that is to consider how the report can be implemented will quickly find that the cost of improving services at Ennis and Nenagh is several times cheaper than doing what has been proposed. Everyone realises that if the number of consultants is to be raised from 109 to 305, there must be places to locate them and their patients. Only 10% of this number would provide these services at no capital cost at Nenagh and for €15 million in capital costs in Ennis.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">Bigger is not always better. Over the years we have concentrated on critical mass issues, especially in the greater Dublin area. The Hanly report will have a negligible impact on Dublin because so many options are available. I am sure the Minister of State's brother, the Taoiseach, would agree and, as he would say, it is down to the demographics and the geographics. He has used this phrase that encompasses much but answers little.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">There has been a national health strategy, the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly reports and we have even had the Government boasting about the €10 billion that is to be spent on the health service, yet it is worse than what he had many years ago. It is an appalling vista for the taxpayer and patients that, while a great deal of money is being invested in the service, nobody knows exactly where it is going and we are not getting value for money. The patient is not being put first.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan:</from>
          <p eId="para_210">It proves the point that the Government should have reformed the service before it started spending money. Despite the input of additional funds, public services in the country are creaking. Fine Gael strongly advocates reform. There have been enough reports and we want to see action rather than words. The Hanly report is another action away from the Minister for Health and Children taking action. When will we have the Martin report? The national health strategy was supposed to be the greatest ever report. How many more reports will be written on the health services before we see action?</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The working time directive, which is to be implemented, will cost an enormous amount of money to implement. The capital investment needed in regional hospitals has not been provided for in the Estimates. What will we do in the meantime? People will be frightened about the prospects for their local services, especially accident and emergency and maternity services.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I am most familiar with St. Luke's General Hospital, as is the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The hospital has done an excellent job and has reduced its waiting lists. It has increased its activity and 24,500 admissions were made to the accident and emergency department last year. It is a huge throughput. People can go the hospital's medical assessment unit and get a bed. A large number of patients can be dealt with in short periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The geographical area identified in Hanly cites a population of 250,000 and this will certainly have an impact on a hospital such as St. Luke's. I want to see the report being well thought out. I do not want to see a hospital lose some of its services because of the notions of a small group of people who did not consult everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I agree with Deputy Killeen, the general practitioners have a major problem in accepting that they were consulted. Despite the presence of the chairman of their organisation on the review group, I do not believe GPs were properly consulted. If certain services in Nenagh, Ennis or other hospitals are closed, what will be the new catchment areas that will form the new and better services according to Hanly?</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Minister for Health and Children needs to take on the power of the professional bodies. Medical guidelines laid down by medical personnel across the professions call into question whether this report is interested in all parts of the country and not just the large population centres. I urge the Minister to think long and hard before undertaking the implementation of this report. He should take into account the concerns voiced by Members on all sides of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I thank my colleague for sharing time with me. Will the Minister of State inform us if the task force, especially Mr. Hanly, consult local communities on this issue? It seems that it only consulted the staff and consultants and this is a consultant-led report. This is the 148th report we have received. With a €10 billion budget this year, we want action rather than reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The national treatment purchase scheme is an area where money can be saved. Under the scheme, people have been sent to Manchester and elsewhere and anyone who receives treatment is naturally delighted to get it. How much economic sense does this make when the same treatment could be carried out in Monaghan General Hospital where the theatre and staff are available? We want value for money rather than money being wasted for political purposes.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford:</from>
          <p eId="para_219">Monaghan hospital is not even allowed to be on-call. Before the Minister took the hospital off-call, it gave Northern Ireland based patients the same treatment now being carried out in Manchester. This is how bad this failure has been.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">There is no proper debate. How can I make a reasonable comment on the Monaghan General Hospital issue in the five minutes allocated to me? The Dáil took a week's recess some weeks ago. Why was the Hanly report not discussed on those three days? We have only been allowed to make statements. We are not allowed to ask questions and there is no opportunity to vote. I would like to see people that have been vocal on the report in their constituencies voting here in the way they told their constituents they would. Deputy Hoctor will be aware that I do not refer to her, rather to her famous ministerial colleague who tried to shaft her. The Minister said this was the map of the way forward for acute hospital services and would deliver all necessary facilities and that local hospitals would continue to provide the great majority of treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The following case was brought to my notice this morning. A 97 year old lady was brought to Monaghan General Hospital where she was told she had to go to Drogheda to have her finger looked at, but after waiting a considerable time in Drogheda she was told nothing needed to be done. She was lucky in having her family to look after her and guide her through the system, and the staff were extremely helpful in taking account of the trauma she was experiencing. How does this incident tally with the Minister's statement that all minor cases will be dealt with at local hospitals? Things do not work that way. That lady would not even be taken into Cavan hospital and she had to travel the 60 miles to Drogheda.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Drogheda hospital, where I was born, is an extremely good hospital but it is not capable of dealing with the overload being forced on it and on Cavan hospital. Monaghan hospital has been used as the template for the Hanly report and other reports. It has been closed down without preparation and without funding being provided for the other hospitals which are to provide the additional service.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">On 21 October last, a man was rushed to Cavan hospital with a severe chest complaint The consultant in Cavan is trying desperately to have him admitted to the Mater Hospital in Dublin and held him in Cavan hospital, at considerable cost, for three and a half weeks in case anything worse would happen to him. The man is now at home and his family are in desperation because they do not know what might happen from one hour to the next. Nevertheless, the Minister tells us how the systems are to be upgraded. Cavan hospital is doing its best, as is Drogheda. If we are to operate a Hanly report structure we must see capital funding for the regional hospitals before general hospitals are wound down.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">In January 2002, the Minister for Health and Children stood on a public platform and guaranteed that all the good things he is now promising to other local hospitals would be delivered to Monaghan if we would only have patience. Monaghan hospital was taken off call on 3 July 2003 and is still not on call, although the staff behind the scenes are delivering the best service possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">We do not need reports. We need common sense action led by the community and not by consultants, who do not give a tuppence and only wish to ensure that they have the best possible time. The Government must confront the consultants before patients die.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_65">
          <from>Ms Hoctor:</from>
          <p eId="para_226">Tá mé buíoch díot, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an seans seo a thabhairt dom labhairt faoi thuairisc Hanly. I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on the Hanly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Nenagh hospital, my local hospital, is a pilot site and, together with Ennis hospital, is under the microscope with the mid-west region's proposed participation in the implementation of the Hanly report. From the beginning I have recognised the benefits for Nenagh hospital in the recommendations of the Hanly report. The report set out to put in place upgraded services to improve patient care to treat the patient in the most appropriate setting, based on the recommendations of medical staff, that is, doctors, nurses, consultants and general practitioners. I believe this is the right way to move in identifying the problems, addressing them and working together with the medical staff to reach a solution which would deliver a world class health service to the patient swiftly, efficiently and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">In putting in place the reduced hours and enhanced services at the regional hospitals I call on the Minister to take cognisance of the importance of hospitals like Nenagh hospital, which currently serves not alone the fast growing population of 7,000 in the town of Nenagh, but the greater rural area reaching back to Riverstown on the Offaly border, Lorrha and Redwood on the Galway border and the large towns of Thurles and Templemore and their rural and often remote hinterlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Following the public meeting called by the town council in Nenagh, concerns have emerged regarding not so much what is said in the Hanly report as what is not said in it. I share the concerns of general practitioners and the public about the provision of a doctor for 24 hours and day, seven days a week. It is unthinkable and unacceptable that, in the long-term, a doctor would not be on duty at Nenagh hospital between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. The current provision of an anaesthetist on call overnight for accident and emergency in Nenagh is paramount and must stay. This is proved by specific cases of people who have been stabilised in Nenagh and kept overnight because they would not have survived the journey to Limerick in the initial stages of trauma. General practitioners need the assurance that they may admit a patient at any time of night if they so need.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Mr. Hanly's proposals focus on securing benefits for the centres of excellence in a large urban setting but due regard must be given to the rural population dispersed in the far-reaching countryside. Those in trauma a long distance away need the assurance of an accident and emergency service in Nenagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I welcome the concept of emergency medical technicians with advanced training. I call on the Minister to proceed with the training of such teams in co-operation with the unions, putting in place the advanced ambulance service and, at the same time, leaving accident and emergency services in Nenagh. The merit of the emergency medical technicians is not clear to the public or even to some medical staff and nurses. It is not until there is full confidence in the proposed enhanced ambulance service that it will be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">We hear on the grapevine in Nenagh that the rabbit will be pulled out of the hat and that the leader of the Labour Party will join our march next Saturday week in defence of Nenagh hospital. The Labour Party in north Tipperary has been known in the past for great talk and pathetic delivery. Mr. Barry Desmond, when Minister for Health, had an ideal opportunity to upgrade Nenagh hospital, as had his colleague, Mr. Brendan Howlin, but no capital investment was made by either of them. They are good to talk but poor on delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I acknowledge the investment already made by the Government in Nenagh hospital, with an additional consultant and a fine extension wing. The €5.5 million invested, and now visible in the comfort of the new extension, is indicative of the Government's commitment to Nenagh hospital. This includes the enhanced intensive care unit facility first introduced to Nenagh by the Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, and upgraded in 1998 when announced by his successor, Deputy Cowen. Provision of the much needed psychiatric unit in the next three years will be welcomed by the local people whose needs are being served in St. Michael's in Clonmel until the unit is finally in place. I welcome the Minister's recent approval of a new community hospital facility at Thurles which will replace the existing Hospital of the Assumption, and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who was to the fore in achieving this. Continued investment is needed to upgrade the services at Nenagh and to reduce our dependency on the larger hospital in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">While I fully acknowledge the need for specialist multidisciplinary teams it has been clearly stated by GPs, nurses and medical staff associated with Nenagh that the hospital is capable of enhanced treatment services with additional staff and equipment in place. The provision of a CT scanner and MRI scanner with the accompanying staff would give greater support to the medical and surgical facilities already in existence in Nenagh. I welcome the recognition given in the Hanly report to the identified need for this equipment and urge the Minister to accept that these are clearly needed at Nenagh hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">We are in earnest in holding on to what we have with a view to seeking funding for enhanced services at Nenagh. This would enable us to continue what is already being done in Nenagh with greater ease, swiftness and effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">We need the retention of the service of a doctor 24 hours a day, seven days a week to assure general practitioners that a patient may be admitted to Nenagh hospital at any time of the day or night. We need to retain our accident and emergency services as we know them and enhance our ambulance service by providing it with upgraded equipment. We want to keep our services in Nenagh. In retaining them we look to the Minister for enhanced services, including the CT scanner, the MRI scanner and cardiologists, so that the service currently in place in Nenagh may continue with greater effectiveness. I look forward to working with the Friends of Nenagh Hospital action committee, the project team and the Minister to solve the difficulties and deliver for greater patient care in north Tipperary and the mid-west region.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">There is a big difference between the two pilot areas outlined in the national task force report, namely, those of the Mid-Western Health Board and the East Coast Area Health Board. Loughlinstown Hospital is located within six or seven miles, or within half an hour, of St. Vincent's Hospital. The downgrading of Nenagh and Ennis hospitals would have a huge effect. We have all used the words "demographic" and "geographic" over the past week but I believe those who wrote the Hanly report, including Mr. Hanly, did not understand the demographic and geographic considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the famous Hanly report but I regret very much that the House is only having statements on it. Had there been a vote on the report's recommendations, it would have been interesting to see if Members on the other side of the House would have voted against them. I welcome the statements of Deputies Killeen and Hoctor on the predicaments in which they, as Government Deputies, found themselves. I hope they will continue to lobby the various Ministers concerned to ensure that the 24-hour accident and emergency services are maintained in both Ennis and Nenagh hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, will be given a key role in implementing the health reforms. I hope he will use his influence on the Cabinet sub-committee to reiterate his public criticisms and his expressions of concern, uttered on three occasions, regarding the downgrading of Nenagh Hospital. This is very important. Much has happened in the two weeks since the report was published.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The 215-page Hanly report was commissioned to put in place the framework for the implementation of the EU Working Time Directive in respect of junior doctors. It now appears that Mr. Hanly was given the task of producing the report in the certain knowledge that no extra funding would be put in place for the implementation of the directive. The funding to implement the proposals and create centres of excellence, as provided for in the recently published Estimates, is very paltry. Therefore, I cannot see how the recommendations can be implemented. Mr. Hanly says implementation should take place immediately, but if there is no money available this cannot happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">Paragraph 3.7.5 of the Hanly report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The conclusion that the full range of emergency services can only be provided in Major Hospitals may raise concerns about the access of patients to treatment in life-threatening situations. It should be noted, however, that many of the main life-saving measures in emergencies are not affected by the immediate proximity of a hospital. The critical concerns are early resuscitation and early access to skilled diagnostic, medical, surgical and anaesthetic care. This can best be provided in a consultant-staffed Major Hospital . . . .</p>
          <p eId="para_253">In other words, it states that proximity does not make a difference in terms of life-saving measures, yet it states that early access is important.

          <p eId="para_259">The Hanly report makes recommendations on the future of the health services for the next 20 years and more. Considering that the Cabinet could not agree on it, it will be very hard for everyone else to accept it as a blueprint for the future. While nobody could question the qualifications of those who produced the report, they have made insufficient reference to instances in which they asked customers or patients for their views. Fine words and rhetoric are coming from the health experts but there is no proof that they consulted any groups or organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">One must define clearly whether the projected health service will be for the health care professionals or for the patients who need it. The report states that compliance with the EU Working Time Directive and the move to a consultant-provided service "will require phasing out all non-training NCHD posts . . .  and ensuring that additional posts are not created purely to meet service needs." What is the point if it is not to meet service needs? This is the purpose of the health service. I am worried about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Local hospitals, such as that in Navan, have over many years and at a cost of millions of euro of taxpayers' money, established a long tradition of caring for the communities they service and from which they derive a large proportion of their staff. Many more voices than that of Mr. Hanly will be required to convince the people of Navan and other areas that the maintenance of their hospitals is not the best approach for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">It has been stated in public – I am inclined to agree – that because of the Government's record, the Hanly report will be cherry-picked by the Government to achieve what it wants to achieve, i.e. cutbacks in the health service. I assure the House that I, for one, will not tolerate any negative changes under the report until permanent infrastructure has been put in place and until the people are guaranteed a proper, efficient health service where it is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">We all strive for a better health service. As the Minister of State said, €10 billion is a lot of money, but we all know we are not getting value for it. In spite of what the Minster for Health might say, he is at fault. He is the boss.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">A 4% increase in the number of beds available in recent years represents a complete failure. No matter how much the Hanly report is talked up, it cannot take away from this.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I am talking about beds and service on the ground. I compliment the Minister of State on the amount of money that has been allocated, but he will agree that we are not getting value for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">We require root and branch reform of the health service, starting at the top and working down rather than in the other direction. The Hanly report is a challenge and an opportunity for us all, but without an understanding of this challenge or a willingness to accept criticism or genuine objections, health service reform will not stand a chance. I am not saying I fully accept the report but I realise it has some good proposals. My only hope is that it, like so many reports before it, will not end up on the shelf or in a bin because of a lack of political leadership. This would be wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I agree with the concept of health service reform. Hanly 1 is not the full answer. I want to see Hanly 2 and then we will decide if it is right or wrong. There is no point in publishing a report that says future reports will be published which will not focus on Dublin and the bigger regions but on the other hospitals in the country. This is not good enough. We cannot make decisions based solely on the first Hanly report. It has both good and bad recommendations. It has caused much fear because it is not clear or concise. It does not appear to be patient-orientated. We need to get the rest of the information before we start making any major changes or decisions to wind down or downgrade hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">If one were to ask the average person on the street to make a choice between a top class, regionalised health service, which we all agree would provide the best service once one reaches hospital, or local hospitals which currently provide a high quality service, he or she would choose a local service. We all say politics is about location, location, location – the same applies to our hospital services. When the work is being done for the second Hanly report, I will make a strong case for Navan General Hospital because it is in the right location.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Dr. Devins:</from>
          <p eId="para_270">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Hanly report or, to give its full title, the report of the national task force on medical staffing. The task force was established by the Minister because of the requirement in the European working time directive that non-consultant hospital doctors must, from 1 August 2004, work no longer than 58 hours per week on average. It is amazing that in this day and age, junior hospital doctors who are in effect doctors in training, are required to work excessively long hours, with some working in excess of 100 hours per week. No other group of workers would tolerate such conditions. Tiredness, with its potential for a serious mistake, possibly with fatal consequences, is the inevitable result of such long working hours. All Members of the House will welcome the reduction in non-consultant hospital doctors' hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">In addition to the need to reduce non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours, the need to change the method of delivery of our hospital service from a consultant led to a consultant delivered service has become apparent in recent years. The health care service must provide the best possible care to the patient who is, after all, the most important person in the health care system. The ready availability of a consultant in the specialty required by the patient is a <i>sine qua non</i> if our system is to be the best possible health service. The Hanly report lays down the template for best meeting both the aforementioned requirements and, as such, I warmly welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">In doing so. it is important to clarify exactly what the report states. There has been considerable discussion of the report in the media and a significant amount of negativity has developed. From some of the comments, it is patently obvious that the Hanly report has not been read by the people concerned, or else parts of it have been selectively used. The report explicitly states that a full range of hospital services should be available in each region. This means that patients will not have to travel outside their region for specialised treatment, other than for services provided at national level in accordance with best international practice. Let us compare this with the current position in which patients must travel to Dublin or Cork because the services they require are not available in their region. No neurologist is available in the North-Western Health Board area, which means patients must make a journey of 130 miles from Sligo, or more from Donegal which is even further, to see a neurologist in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Let us take the position of patients who suffer from multiple sclerosis. Is it fair to ask such patients to travel long distances to see their consultant? The first Hanly report is concerned only with two regions, the mid-west, that is, counties Clare, Tipperary and Limerick, and the east coast area centred around St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin. The current position in Limerick is that the county has no rheumatologist. If the Hanly report is implemented, it will have four rheumatologists. As a member of the Committee on Health and Children, I recently heard evidence from patients and consultant rheumatologists concerning the low level of consultant rheumatology posts. All those giving evidence agreed that the provision of even two consultant posts in rheumatology in Limerick would be a significant step forward. When the recommendations of the Hanly report are implemented, the mid-western region will have four rheumatologists.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The role of local hospitals will be enhanced, not diminished, if the Hanly report is acted upon. Instead of having only two or three specialties, an additional range of specialties will be available in each local hospital. Considerable debate has centred on the role of emergency treatment rooms which currently operate in some of our smaller hospitals. If patients are to have the best possible care when they are involved in a serious accident or sustain a major, life-threatening medical injury, the provision of immediate, highly trained care at the site of the emergency offers the best chance of survival. It is an essential requirement of the report that ambulance personnel with advanced training be available all over the country. In this regard, the implementation body the Minister is about to announce must insist that ambulance crew with advanced training and appropriate equipment are in place at the start of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Despite the considerable sums allocated to the hospital services, severe problems remain. This year, approximately €10 billion will be spent on the provision of health care. The time for reports is now over. The Hanly report, in conjunction with the Brennan and Prospectus reports, charts the way forward. While there will be problems along the way and local fears will have to be allayed, I strongly believe that the implementation of the recommendations of this report will result in a much better health service, which is something to which all of us in the House aspire.</p>

        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. Wall:</from>
          <p eId="para_276">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Hanly report. This debate is gaining momentum across the country, which is to be welcomed by all sides of the House. Concerns have been expressed in areas to which the report did not refer and about which it makes no proposals. This is regrettable and is leading to considerable confusion and contradictions in many areas. Following the events in Ennis, it is clear the debate will heat up when the second phase of the report is brought to fruition, and many similar demonstrations by concerned constituents will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Many of the supporters of the report argue that one must look at the overall picture. This is difficult when my concerns and those of the constituents I represent are not, as yet, in the picture. The report states that the task force makes no specific recommendations about the application of its proposed model to the rest of the country, but proposes that the organisation of hospital services should be the subject of a second report to be prepared as quickly as possible. In addition, it states that the proposals in the first report should be used to help inform the development of proposals nationally. This statement has led to a great deal of conjecture on how the greater Dublin area, with which one would align County Kildare, including my constituency, will be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Naas General Hospital has recently experienced drastic changes, all of which have been welcome. One could say a new hospital has been built on the old site. Problems have occurred, however, in obtaining funding to permit the new facilities to be used to their fullest. One cannot but express dismay that this should occur in circumstances in which Tallaght General Hospital, the sister hospital of Naas General Hospital, is experiencing overcrowded conditions and is unable to function properly due to lack of funding from the Departments of Finance and Health and Children. This does not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">If one were to use the report's proposals for information purposes for my area, one could only assume that Naas General Hospital, despite all the wonderful work recently completed on it, will not function as an active accident and emergency hospital. This is despite the fact that all the Dublin hospitals are warning the general public practically on a daily basis about overcrowded conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">With the second report not yet published, we must obviously discuss this issue in negative terms. As Deputy English stated, Navan General Hospital is in the same position as Naas General Hospital. The question of what will happen to hospitals in the hinterland of Dublin, in which large sums of taxpayers' money have been invested, remains a grey area. We do not know what will happen now.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Minister was chairman of the South-Western Area Health Board and he knows that Naas and Tallaght hospitals have formed a great relationship. Indeed, he was probably involved in forming it given the movement of consultants between the two hospitals. What will happen to that relationship? Will it continue? Will Naas hospital become part of the greater Dublin area, as Navan should be, to facilitate the growth in population in those areas?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Mr. Wall:</from>
          <p eId="para_283">Yes, but will it be part of the sector? St. Vincent's Hospital will be the central focus. What part will Naas play? Will it be just a daily hospital or will it be a full service hospital working within the sector of St. Vincent's Hospital? That is the concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The people in Kildare daily hear about the problems being encountered in St. Vincent's Hospital. It is unable to cater for the current population, let alone with extra numbers from other areas. We must examine what mechanisms can be put in place to provide an infrastructure that will cover areas such as Navan, Naas and Loughlinstown. This is what will generate much of the debate when the second report is produced. Given the population boom in those areas we will have to look at the greater picture rather than just focusing on the centre of the city. The outlying hospitals will have to be part of the function of the main hospital in the sector and not operate as just a daily hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">One has to agree with some aspects of the report. Nobody wants to see junior hospital doctors working 140 hours per week. That is not sustainable, as can be seen in other sectors of the public service, for example, in the prisons. There has to be a reduction in the hours. Life has to be more normal for junior hospital doctors. In doing that, however, we must also consider how to provide the number of professionals required to meet the recommendations in the report. How will that happen? They are not available at present. Take the example of nurses. There is a grave shortage of nurses. An assessment and respite unit in the local geriatric hospital in Athy has had to be closed and yesterday I received notification that the day care unit would also be closed due to the lack of nursing staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">One aspect of the report which is of great importance is in section 2.3. It refers to the setting aside of industrial relations and politics. I listened to David Hanly discuss the report. He had an excellent team and produced a good report. He was most forthcoming in providing information when he visited the parliamentary Labour Party meeting. However, one thing he said sticks in my mind. In reply to a question about industrial relations he said he knew nothing about it and did not want to know anything about it. He said he was asked to produce a way forward based on a greenfield site situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">It is wonderful to see what is contained in the report but what about the contradictory comments from the different medical associations which we saw in the media last week? Some were for it and some were against it. Industrial relations will be a major problem but providing the necessary professional staff will also be a problem. Each week Members of the House put down parliamentary questions to the various Departments about services such as speech and language therapy for children and adults. There are no therapists available. Nevertheless, this report says these professionals will be in every hospital. Deputy Devins told the House there is no neurologist in Sligo. Why? The Department has not provided one. Are we suddenly going to see all these people fall from the sky to make everything in the garden rosy? That will not happen and this is where the report fails. We do not have the professional personnel to fulfil what it proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I welcome the report. The only thing wrong with it is that it does not deal with the entire country. That is a mistake. As a result, there will be a recurrence of what happened in Ennis and Nenagh and is beginning to occur elsewhere. There are many good things in the report but they will be overlooked. However, we must look at the greater Dublin area and examine how places such as Naas, Loughlinstown and Navan can be interlinked to ensure that the services provided will be appropriate for the population, what can be done to ensure there are sufficient professional staff and, above all, how we will overcome the industrial relations problems this report will create.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. Finneran:</from>
          <p eId="para_289">As the Deputy elected by the people of Longford-Roscommon, I have overseen the largest investment in Roscommon County Hospital since it was built in the 1930s. The hospital's facilities are being refurbished and upgraded. The wards are currently being refurbished. There is a new extra department and screening room, upgraded theatres and a new, state-of-the-art accident, emergency and admissions department. There has been a 25% increase in staff and the number of consultants has doubled in recent years. A total capital investment of over €11 million has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Hanly report has many good points and if resources are made available for the recruitment of extra consultants, the provision of centres of excellence and extra services at all acute hospitals such as Roscommon County Hospital, it will be welcome. However, if the second Hanly report is produced and makes similar proposals which are to be applied to Roscommon County Hospital, this Deputy and the advocates of that report will be on a collision course. I will not accept the removal of any of the services that are being provided at present at that hospital, including the 24-hour accident and emergency service.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The people of Roscommon elected me to develop Roscommon County Hospital and I have discharged my duty in that regard. I will stand with the people of Roscommon and oppose any downgrading of the hospital that will diminish the health service to the people of the county. It should be clearly understood that if the second Hanly report makes similar proposals to those in the first report which attempt to remove existing services from the acute general hospital in Roscommon, I will oppose it and I will oppose anybody in this House who attempts such action.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCallananFF" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. Callanan:</from>
          <p eId="para_292">The main objectives of the Hanly report were to examine the best way forward for the health service and how to achieve a reduction in the working hours of junior doctors from 75 to 48 hours per week by 2009. The Hanly report suggests doubling the number of consultants, which would provide a better and safer service to patients. The report states that a number of major hospitals should become centres of excellence. This would mean patients from the west would no longer have to travel to Dublin for major operations as University College Hospital Galway would have all the facilities as a centre of excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">There would also be general and local hospitals. The report does not recommend the closure or downgrading of hospitals. There is much concern in my home town of Ballinasloe in regard to Portiuncula Hospital. Even though the hospital is not referred to in the report, the threat of the Hanly report is causing concern. I do not see any reduction in services occurring in Portiuncula Hospital, owing to the fact that it is a large hospital serving not just County Galway but a large part of the midlands, including Athlone.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Portiuncula Hospital is nationally known for its excellent maternity services, where up to 2,000 births take place each year. It has a very busy accident and emergency unit where many road accident patients attend due to the fact that Ballinasloe is on the N6. It is an excellent acute hospital with 17 consultants, three of whom are shared with Roscommon. It has a state-of-the-art intensive care and coronary care unit which was opened two years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">As a member of the Western Health Board, I promoted the purchase of Portiuncula Hospital by the board. I felt at the time that if the Western Health Board did not purchase the hospital it would be bought by a private concern for private patients only, and public patients around Ballinasloe could not avail of its services. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Martin, on providing more than €10 million to purchase the hospital, which now employs almost 650 staff. The hospital will not be downgraded and I as the local Deputy will promote the development of Portiuncula Hospital in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I thank the nuns in Portiuncula Hospital for the great work they did through the years to develop the hospital to the standard it provides today. They have served Ballinasloe well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Mr. McHugh:</from>
          <p eId="para_297">I wish to share my time with Deputies Gogarty and Crowe. If we were setting up a health service in the country in a scenario where there was no structure, no hospital or any other such health infrastructure in place, the Hanly report would have much relevance and a lot to recommend it. We could then divide the country into equal regional divides and work from there. However we are not living in that Utopian artificial health situation. We are living in the real Ireland where there is a health system of sorts. There are some very good hospitals which provide a high level of health service under difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The Hanly report missed that reality and, consequently, what could be termed very good rural hospitals are now under threat. The effect of the Hanly report recommendations is that all the investment that has been put into these rural hospitals over the years can now be designated as waste. The report is basically stating that medical practitioners in these rural hospitals are not capable of continuing to provide the high level of service to which the population in these catchment areas has become accustomed. The medical professionals in these hospitals find that insinuation highly insulting.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The Minister stated that the report is not about downgrading hospitals. If that is the Minister's view, he needs to give a solemn undertaking to hospitals that feel under threat that they will not be downgraded. While no model has been developed for the Western Health Board area, the clear indications are that Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, is in danger of being downgraded. This realisation has caused much anger in the area and, indeed, much worry has been generated among the public in the very big multi-county area Portiuncula serves. Is the Minister in a position to confirm the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, that no change will occur to Portiuncula Hospital under the terms of the Hanly report?</p>
          <p eId="para_300">As I said initially, if we had a greenfield site scenario countrywide, the Hanly report would be invaluable. While I have been critical of its potential to downgrade hospitals, I believe it has the potential to provide a framework in areas that lack hospital services. I refer specifically to Tuam, the commitment by the Taoiseach and the Minister to provide a hospital in the town, and the subsequent designation of Tuam as a hub under the national spatial strategy. One of the characteristics is that such a hub would have a local hospital. Now is the opportunity for the Minister to put his promises into action, develop a prototype local hospital in Tuam and use it to indicate what a local hospital can be, as envisaged by the Hanly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">No other study, report or assessment is needed to underpin the case for a hospital in Tuam. The Western Health Board submitted its planning brief for the Tuam hospital to the Department on 8 October 2002, and it has remained there since. No action has been taken and no response has been given. The Western Health Board submission on Tuam hospital, including separate submissions on a primary care unit, ambulance base and services for the elderly in Tuam to cover the catchment area of north Galway, south Mayo and west Roscommon, are all elements of a local hospital. These all point to the need for a local hospital in Tuam. I ask that the go-ahead be given to Tuam hospital. I ask the Minister to honour his commitment, and the commitment of the Taoiseach, to the region. The Hanly report is the vehicle for doing so.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty:</from>
          <p eId="para_302">My colleague, Deputy Gormley, has already alluded to many aspects of the Hanly report and how it will impact on communities throughout the country. We are aware of the debate in the pilot counties. The Green Party in Ennis has kept us up-to-date on the impact the proposals would have in that county. While the Hanly report is broadly welcome, I was particularly interested in reading it because of issues in my constituency. However, I am not the spokesman on health – Deputy Gormley has the major expertise on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I was accused some time ago by the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, of engaging in parish pump politics because I dared to raise the issue of Peamount Chest Hospital on the Adjournment. In the context of the Hanly report, given that I have just three and a half minutes, I want to use my time to focus on how Peamount could be destroyed and how it is currently being dismantled. There is a five year programme to create certain levels of improvement in some aspects of Peamount Chest Hospital. It appears that due to the intransigence and ideology of Comhairle na nOspidéal, and another person called Martin, the chest hospital option is being phased out. This is a lesson for the country as a whole in regard to the implementation of the Hanly report. Dr. Luke Clancy and others attached to both St. James's Hospital and Peamount Hospital have said patients could wait for up to four hours in an operating theatre, such is the level of work and bureaucracy that takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">We have already heard from some of our colleagues in Nenagh about how that hospital can be much more effective. Local hospitals can get work done much faster than hospitals in major centres because there are professional, dedicated staff and there is not the same workload of a general nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The same applies to Peamount. The chest hospital treats chronic sufferers of tuberculosis. These are not acute patients who can have high tech treatment and then leave. These are people who do not necessarily take their medication correctly. Some of them suffer from AIDS, are drug addicts or have other long-term disorders which render them unable to integrate properly into the community. It makes sense for such people to be treated in a hospital such as Peamount. This hospital has served people for decades. If it is not broken, why fix it?</p>
          <p eId="para_306">In the context of the Hanly report, Peamount Hospital is a shining example of how a local small hospital has built up expertise over the years, and this expertise is in danger of being dispersed. As Deputy Gormley pointed out in the press conference, if chronic sufferers of TB are not treated when their symptoms begin to flare up because of the dismantling of Peamount and the fact that the high tech facility in St. James's Hospital will not cater for chronic sufferers of TB, there is a danger that a nation-wide epidemic will occur. Given that the incidence of tuberculosis is on the increase, there is such a danger. There is a need to focus the expertise where it works and is cost effective. For that reason I reiterate my call to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to do all in his power to ensure the chest hospital is retained at Peamount.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe:</from>
          <p eId="para_307">Earlier this month in Dublin, 120 patients were left on trolleys in the five accident and emergency units across the city. In my constituency, Tallaght Hospital was one of the worst affected with almost 40 patients waiting on trolleys, 19 of whom were in hospital corridors and many had been lying there for days. I visited some of those patients. One man who had a stroke was left there for a number of days. He spoke about the indignity of trying to get to a toilet. While some people say it is not a great discomfort, when one speaks to patients it is an indignity. A lady with whom I spoke was on her fourth heart attack and was left lying there for a number of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Tallaght Hospital is supposed to be the flagship hospital but has been starved of funds and has had sections downgraded. Of those on the waiting list for Tallaght Hospital, 35% have been on it for the past two years. The list has increased by 25% since 1997. To many of those families, the Government's solution to the health crisis has been glossy reports and press conferences. We have had the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports and, the greatest solution of all, the Government's health strategy. Those people do not want reports, they want action and firm decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Minister challenged us to produce an alternative. There are a number of alternatives to what is happening. Sinn Féin seeks the phasing out of the two-tier system to be replaced by a national health service, free at the point of delivery and funded from general taxation. Government policy should be focused on that goal and in the transition period should seek to minimise inequities and inefficiencies in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">In Sinn Féin's pre-budget submission, published yesterday, we called for the establishment of a Cabinet committee on health to spearhead the phasing in of an Irish health service. The committee's first tasks would be to plan the transition, assess costs and savings in the short, medium and long-terms and commence multi-annual budgeting on that basis. We called for the acceleration of the renegotiation of the common contract for consultant medical staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The Government must ensure a fairer deal for public patients and an end to the exploitation of the two-tier health system. All new consultant posts should be exclusively in the public system. We urge the expansion of the medical card system to all those on or below the minimum age, those under 18 years of age, those in full-time education or those over 65 years of age. There should be a review of the national treatment purchase fund where taxpayers' money goes to the already heavily subsidised private sector for patients on public waiting lists instead of being invested in the public sector. Tax incentives for private public care and for the construction of private medical facilities should be abolished and the savings put into the public system. There is a need to look at how the health service could be improved through greater all-Ireland co-operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Hanly report. I have listened to the debate for the past hour and have noted the concern, and rightly so, for local hospitals and particularly those that have proved successful. At the same time I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. He has shown a commitment to the health service. Members will recall he was the Minister for Health and Children in the outgoing Government and that he expressed an interest to return to the same portfolio. I put that on the record to show he has a clear commitment to reforming the health service. On the afternoon of his press conference he made it clear the Hanly report would be controversial and would cause concerns but at the same time it was an effort to reform the health service. I fully support the Minister. I am aware that when it comes to the time for the Hanly report to take effect in my area I will have concerns too.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Since 1997, each year at budget time, the Government has increased the health spend and yet there are the same difficulties throughout the State. There are concerns about value for money and patient care. Clearly, to continue on the path of increasing funding without getting the necessary return would do no service to the community. In that regard reform is necessary and I support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">In the past we have tried to introduce certain reforms at regional level and this has caused huge concern. The public is accustomed to and has a love for its local hospitals. In that context it always fears downgrading is on the cards as soon as some reform is mentioned. I do not see it that way. I am fresh from a debate in my constituency where the National Cancer Forum prepared a report. It took four years to bring public opinion around to the view that reform in the shape of a cancer service to a region does not necessarily mean the downgrading of a hospital. For three years I was told that the effect of this major reform would be to reduce my local general hospital to the status of a cottage hospital. The proof has been that the cancer strategy is now operating effectively in the midlands and instead of 1,200 patients travelling each year to Dublin for treatment, 90% can be treated in my region. In the meantime the local general hospital has been upgraded and now has psychiatric and paediatric units.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">That the Minister is working to correct the flaws in the health service is welcome. It is important that he goes about his business with a view to improving the standard of service. A key part of this improvement is to be found in the Hanly report. I accept there are controversial parts in that report. Nevertheless the proposals contained in the report are wide-ranging and will make significant changes to the health service. I understand it will take many years to implement the report. It is not as if we can publish a report and expect immediate results. Many Governments have tried to tackle the issue of the delivery of a health service and many have increased the health spend but unfortunately the return has been minimal.

          <from>Mr. Moloney:</from>
          <p eId="para_322">Although the European working time directive requires us to lower significantly the number of hours that junior doctors work, we should do this anyway. A junior doctor works on average 75 hours per week. In some hospitals doctors work in excess of these hours. In delivering a health service how can junior doctors be expected to provide the best standard of care or complete their training in the best possible manner when they are overworked? The answer is that they cannot. This is why it is important that we move to reduce the workload. I do not hide behind that position to support the Hanly report. The only practical way to do this is by replacing the current approach with a consultant-provided service approach as the Hanly report points out.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">When we visited hospitals, especially those of us who have been members of hospital visiting committees, it was always stressed that consultants were required to be at the front line of hospital treatment. The current system whereby consultants work set hours with several junior doctors reporting to them does not provide the best service. This has been acknowledged throughout the service by practitioners and consumers. By increasing the number of consultants and making them work on a rota around the clock, we should see a great leap forward in the standard of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Patients, regardless of their ailments, want the best qualified staff treating them, and they will receive that through a consultant-provided system. The system could also foster greater team work among hospital staff as consultants will work together rather than on an individual basis as they do now. Similarly, junior doctors will provide a higher standard of service and will make best use of hospital resources in a framework that encourages greater co-operation between health staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Hanly report also recommends that a full range of acute hospital services should be available within each region which is important and why I fully support the report's provisions. It is good news not just for local hospitals but for everyone. The Hanly report also safeguards the future of smaller local hospitals and emphasises, as did the Minister at his press conference, that hospital closures are not on the cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">We also want to see a large increase in the number of services provided in a given region. In my midland area we often have had to make the case to attract various services and spend and lose time trying to organise, seek support and agree on the location of those services. It is important that patients should not have to travel large distances beyond their region to receive common specialist treatments. They should be able to receive all these standard hospital services and others, such as elective general, ear, nose and throat, elective urology, cardiology and plastic surgery, without venturing outside their region. I could go on about this but there will be debate on the necessity to improve the services in the regions for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Many told me, especially in the debate on the cancer strategy, that people from my region had to rely on public transport to travel to Dublin to secure services and to come home afterwards. That is why it is important that the benefits of the Hanly report can be transferred to providing services in the regions. There will be more regionally-based consultants and people will have to travel only a short distance instead of long distances to obtain local services. A positive aspect of the report is that the range of acute hospital services will be available to patients within their own regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">There has been much debate about accident and emergency departments in local hospitals which will continue to cater for 85% of the patients who now attend them. Most major trauma cases will not be affected by having to travel a little further to the region's major hospital but should benefit from having the complete range of qualified staff and the relevant equipment under the one roof.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I wish the Minister well and hope that, in the next few weeks and months, we will have debate and see the benefits of the Hanly report. I hope we will always have the courage to realise that if everybody supports reform, there will be benefits and in some cases disadvantages, but it is a far better approach than simply increasing the health budget. I welcome this attempt to reform the health service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry:</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I am concerned about Sligo General Hospital following the publication of the Hanly report which will affect the region. I give credit to the doctors and nurses and all the staff in that hospital for the outstanding work and service they give to a wide catchment area. I am concerned because the Hanly report catchment area is 350,000 people. Any impact of the report to the effect that its area of excellence would be incorporated with a population base of 350,000 would have a bearing on Sligo. I would like clarification on the definition of a region. The North-Western Health Board region is the closest to my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim where the population is 85,000 and that of Donegal is 140,000. On that figure alone we have a population base of 225,000. The population base of Mayo is 140,000 and Roscommon, 55,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Sligo General Hospital has surgical and general medical services. It does wonderful work and has many key specialist areas. However, it needs a neurologist immediately. This is critically important and is regardless of any implementation. I call on the Minister not to defer this and to appoint a neurologist for Sligo immediately where one is urgently needed. Given the level of specialty in Sligo General Hospital, it is not certain that the Hanly report will make an impact. I hope not because any general downgrading of the hospital will be fought tooth and nail and any Minister would implement it at his or her peril. The Hanly report proposes a trauma specialist service which would incorporate a full range of services in a regional hospital. It would deal with accident victims, all areas of specialty, regionalisation and the appointment of top specialists. That should not be done at the expense of the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Previous speakers have referred to the working time directive and the reduction of hours for medical doctors. We should not lose in Sligo because an EU directive is being implemented which means doctors must work less time. It is not our problem and the people of Sligo should not be penalised because there is a cutback. If that is the case, I call on the Minister to appoint more doctors. It is easy to cut back in any business. If one wants to cut down on overtime, one employs more staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">My main concern is about the demographics of the region. Sligo-Leitrim is one of the regions with the greatest population base of old people. It would be outrageous if older people had to travel to Galway to receive specialised service. There are two hospitals in the North-Western Health Board region, Sligo General Hospital and Letterkenny Hospital. In the context of the Hanly report, since there is a population base of 225,000 people in the Sligo region, we must have a clear statement that there will be no downgrading of that region.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">Ambulance services are essential and so is equality of response. I would be very concerned that in light of the Hanly report these would not be guaranteed. Some €15 million has been spent on a state-of-the-art facility in Manorhamilton. The Hanly report will have a huge impact. It is of major concern for Sligo. I would be very concerned that the implementation of Hanly will deplete what is a good service in Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The level of opposition to Hanly in understandable. I am amazed at the Government's decision on this after 148 reports. The problem with this Government is that nothing is being done. I will fight tooth and nail against any downgrading of Sligo General Hospital.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Dr. Cowley:</from>
          <p eId="para_352">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this very important matter. I am a GP and I am concerned about people's needs. That is why I became a Deputy, to try to push that cause. I got involved in a campaign for an orthopaedic unit in Mayo General Hospital and the first obstacle was put in front of me by the Irish Orthopaedic Association which said that to have a unit in Galway was sufficient, and that to have one in Mayo was ridiculous, because one would not get a proper service. It was the centralisation agenda, but that battle is now won, and the orthopaedic unit is on the way. If Hanly was implemented we would never get such units.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The Hanly blueprints will be used. There are two blueprints, one for the Mid-Western Health Board and the other for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The bottom line is that the blueprint will be applied, after the local elections, so that the urology unit sought by Deputy Perry will never come to Sligo unless Sligo is the main hospital. The centralisation agenda goes on all the time but it is not equitable. It is taking services out of areas and thus contributing to greater depopulation. It does not support any type of regional balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Hanly will do nothing for people on trolleys. The problem with the health service is not the lack of Hanly proposals but the lack of investment. We have recently put 6.7% of our GNP into our health services. Canada, for example, puts in 9.1%. It is questionable if we are even at the EU average in terms of such input. We are now talking about closing hospitals. We do not have enough hospitals. We have 14 hospitals per million of population compared to the UK, for example, which has 27 hospitals per million of population. We need to be improving hospitals rather than closing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The radiotherapy report reflects a similar situation. It is about centralisation but what about the people in the mid-west, the north-west and the south-east? These people need help as well. There are many reports, but reports are not the answer. We need proper investment in our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Hanly report is downright dangerous, and totally impracticable. It is dangerous because it ignores the most basic rule in emergency medicine, namely, that the most appropriate aid is given within the golden hour. That will not happen in Ennis. I was there recently. It is obvious that people coming from Loop Head will have to travel some 70 miles bypassing Ennis in order to go to Limerick. How long will it take them to travel 70 miles over bad roads to Ennis and then to Limerick? We are talking about at least an hour. Where is the golden hour there? There is no doubt that people are going to die. I have a lot of time for Mr. Hanly and I am sure he is a very good business consultant, but the hospital consultants and GPs are speaking out. One sees their criticisms in <i>The Irish Times</i> every day. They are saying that Hanly will cost lives and I agree with that. We do not have the GP structure in place. We do not have helicopter emergency medical services or proper roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I saw Ennis Hospital and it was just like Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar before the investment was made there. What the Ennis area needs is investment. Hanly is a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul, with Paul being the big hospitals and Peter the small hospitals which are being run down. When beds are closed, where are the patients to go? The 22,000 cases seen in Ennis will go to Limerick, but Limerick cannot even cope at the moment. There is no rationale in that. A person in the Ennis area with a ruptured spleen will die, because no matter how many first responders are there, that person must get the necessary emergency operation in Ennis rather than Limerick, because the person will be dead before arrival in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">This is impracticable because the consultants' contracts, and those of the people supporting the consultants, will have to be renegotiated. That is not an easy matter. There will be a cutback in the output of the medical schools with the new entry scheme. Even if all this could be sorted out, where are the beds? They are not there. We were promised 3,000 further beds under the health strategy. Their absence proves that the money was never put into the system. Had the money been invested, we would have the beds. We got only 330 beds. To borrow Frankie Byrne's phrase, has Hanly knocked at everyone's door? Remember that.</p>

        <speech by="#FionnaOMalleyPD" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Ms F. O'Malley:</from>
          <p eId="para_359">With the publication of the Hanly report we have crossed a Rubicon on health reform, and there is no turning back. I have just heard Deputy Cowley say that just because it is difficult it should not be taken on. The health system cannot remain as it is. The way in which it is currently constituted is unsustainable. Change is imperative, and the European Working Time Directive requires us to make the necessary changes. We cannot afford not to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">In discussing Hanly it is important to remember the terms of reference and to remain closely focused on them. The terms of reference include the devising, costing and promoting the implementation of a new model of hospital service delivery based on appropriately trained doctors providing patients with the highest quality service using available resources as equitably, efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">What we need to remember is that there is not a bottomless pit in terms of the health budget. It currently stands at €10 billion. That is generous by any standards and I have heard many Opposition Members agree. If we look at how much reform we have, the level of improved health care resulting from these enormous increases has been minimal. The good fortune the Minister for Health and Children currently enjoys in dealing with health reform is that he has proven beyond doubt that it is no longer a question of money but of the restructuring needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The national task force on medical staffing is by no means a panacea, and David Hanly himself would not seek such accolades for the report he has presented. However, it is a very necessary beginning and the keystone in the construction of an improved health service for all Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Criticism was made of the fact that political sensitivities, industrial relations issues and vested interests were, quite rightly, set aside in the production of this report. The report's proposals are aimed at delivering improved patient care. In order to produce an honest and objective report with medical and patient concerns to the fore, it is necessary to set aside all the political and industrial relations concerns. Naturally they cannot be ignored when it comes to implementation. Implementation will be a challenge because it is something that is difficult to deliver. However, that is not a sufficient reason to do nothing. I stated in the House on a previous occasion and I repeat it now that it will be the measure of the success of this Government if it rises to the challenge of health reform and it would be a disgrace if we fail to elicit better value for money for the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I attended a ceremony earlier this week where I was reminded of the words of John F. Kennedy when he spoke in 1961 of the four criteria by which the holders of public office would be judged by history. The question would be whether they were truly men of courage, judgment, integrity and dedication. Each one of us honoured with a seat in this House needs to be satisfied that we can answer those questions in the affirmative and none more so than Ministers. Government policy must never be sacrificed on the altar of the parish pump. It is understandable that Members of the House have the interests of their constituents and constituency at heart but Ministers are required to keep the long-term national interest to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The demands of this report will challenge the resolve of Deputies up and down the country and they will look to the commitment and leadership of Government to support them in dealing with the difficult local concerns they face. This report is a radical departure and people are worried about the local consequences. They need to be reassured that the new infrastructure will be supported by adequate ambulance services and the consolidation of accident and emergency at networks of excellence will provide an improved service throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Hanly report has recommended multi-disciplinary teams in the network hospitals of excellence. At present seriously ill patients have to travel to Dublin but that will no longer be the case. They will be treated in their regional centre by multi-disciplinary teams of consultants who will deal with most of the concerns, the only possible exception being neurosurgery, as I understand it. This reform will deliver a better service but it must go hand in hand with the recommendations of the other reports on the health service and in particular the report on the new GP service. The Hanly report is a brave step forward and I commend it.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore:</from>
          <p eId="para_367">I am glad Deputy Fiona O'Malley has reminded the House of the terms of reference which were given to the Hanly team. Listening to speakers from the Government side of the House who are now disengaging from the Hanly report, one would think that Mr. Hanly produced this report of his own volition. That is not the case; he did what he was asked to do. The Government asked him to re-mould the hospital services around the fact that from 1 August 2004, the EU working time directive will come into effect for non-consultant hospital doctors. From the very beginning he was given a job of work to do by Government which necessarily involved, as far as his terms of reference were concerned, the reduction in the number of hospitals, the concentration of services in major hospitals and the resultant rationalisation. Mr. Hanly is to be complimented on his work. I am sure he must be feeling a little sore at this stage that, having done the job he was asked to do by Government, he finds so many Deputies from the Government side, including Ministers, literally dropping him in the manure.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I am surprised Deputy Fiona O'Malley did not address the fact that the Hanly report examined two pilot areas in order to reach its conclusions. One of the pilot areas is the area for which Deputy O'Malley and I are representatives, the East Coast Area Health Board. Many Deputies whose areas have not yet been examined might wish to know what has happened in our area. Just one and a half pages of a 211 page report are devoted to the East Coast Area Health Board. That is the total description of the hospital services in that area. There are currently three acute hospitals there, St. Vincent's Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital in Dun Laoghaire and St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown. The Hanly report proposes that there should one major hospital, St. Vincent's, and two local hospitals, St. Michael's and Loughlinstown. The report states that the full range of emergency services can only be provided at major hospitals. It proposes that in the local hospitals should be what are called "nurse-led minor injury units" for an extended day, that is, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., depending on the volume of cases. For St. Michael's in Dun Laoghaire and for Loughlinstown hospital, it means in practical terms that the accident and emergency departments of those hospitals will close. There will be no accident and emergency service at all after 8 p.m. and during the day there will be only a "nurse-led minor injury unit", in other words, a glorified Band-Aid station. If the Hanly report is implemented, all the accident and emergency cases such as road accident injuries, accidents in school playgrounds, heart attacks, which give rise to patients being rushed to a hospital, will all be brought to St. Vincent's Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The constituency which both Deputy Fiona O'Malley and I represent will certainly note Deputy O'Malley's contribution in the House which shows she agrees with the closure of the accident and emergency departments at both St. Michael's and Loughlinstown. In the one and a half pages devoted to the East Coast Area Health Board, there is no analysis given of the accident and emergency cases distributed between the three hospitals. There is no explanation or justification as to why they should be concentrated in St. Vincent's in the first place, either for reasons of geography, medical care or whatever, other than the general statements made in the report. One wonders why this conclusion was reached, given the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I suggest an examination of a typical week such as the third week of October. I understand that the accident and emergency cases presenting to the three hospitals were as follows: 780 in St. Vincent's; 500 in Loughlinstown; 400 in St. Michael's. If there were more accident and emergency cases in St. Michael's in Dun Laoghaire and Loughlinstown together than there were in St. Vincent's, why are the accident and emergency services to be concentrated in St. Vincent's? How can anyone justify that between St. Vincent's in Ballsbridge and Waterford city, there will be no accident and emergency department in any hospital? Not only the entire population of Dun Laoghaire and south Dublin but the entire south-east of the country will have no accident and emergency service. If an accident occurs in Arklow or Gorey, the choice for the ambulance crew is between Waterford city or all the way to St. Vincent's in Dublin.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I did not realise geography was such a weak point on Deputy Conor Lenihan's part but if he has not noticed already, Tallaght is on the west of the city. He also has not noticed the distribution of major hospitals in Dublin which are situated largely around the M50 ring road, leaving a situation where the southern end of Dublin with Wicklow and the south-east does not have the service of a major hospital. Apart from the general rationale which is followed in the Hanly report, and which is questionable, the conclusion that bigger is better is not supported by the evidence he sets out himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Leaving the general argument aside, we should know what analysis was carried out when Hanly looked at the East Coast Area Health Board. Is there are longer report? Is one and a half pages the entire size of it? Surely there are background documents and reports on the East Coast Area Health Board, a summary of the discussions Hanly undertook with the consultants and management of the hospital services in the East Coast Area Health Board on which the one and a half pages are based. That summary and documentation should be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">If there is to be just one major hospital serving the East Coast Area Health Board, was the option of locating it other than in St. Vincent's examined? There are constraints in St. Vincent's with the amount of land available and difficulties with traffic and parking. Surely the option of Loughlinstown, which has 20 acres of land available located at what will be the major motorway junction on the southern side of the city, must have been examined? If it was, the considerations should be published. Was the option of distributing the specialties between the three hospitals examined and, if so, why was it dismissed? How did we end up with the conclusion that the hospital with less than half of the total accident and emergency admissions has been selected as the major hospital to serve the East Coast Area Health Board?</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Even under Hanly's own terms of reference to rationalise hospital services, the conclusions reached are not based on hospital requirements and the available evidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">That is what the Hanly report does. We cannot continue to pour more money as we have done over the last six years into a health care system that just gobbles up the money and returns nothing in reform, productivity or increased output. That is the bottom line in terms of health reform. There are vested interests and Deputy Cowley clearly represents the doctors and consultants rather than the constituents and patients of Mayo. He is playing out his own personal professional prejudices and pastimes of a lifetime as a doctor who tries to keep the doctors' racket going in this health system. That is all it is and some of the attitudes of these consultants are not dissimilar to the attitudes displayed by some taxi drivers when their monopoly was being threatened by deregulation and reform.

During the launch of the Hanly report in Government Buildings, the Minister and Mr. Hanly denied on three separate occasions and before anybody read it that the report was about downgrading. We then knew this issue concerned downgrading. One should try to tell a patient suffering a heart attack or a haemorrhage that the lack of an accident and emergency department to treat him or her does not equate to downgrading at their local hospital.</p>

What we have is a prototype of the report and we in the north-east have seen the results that has yielded. There have been roadside deaths and roadside births in Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">One only has to consider the plight of Christina Knox who, at 10 o'clock in the morning, was ten minutes away from her physician and an idle bed in Monaghan General Hospital, was transferred to another hospital and died 40 minutes later. We all remember the Livingstone tragedy.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">There were other tragedies in Dundalk. If the Minister persists with implementation of the Hanly report we will witness such tragedies in Nenagh, Ennis, Monaghan and south Dublin. This report condemns the people of rural Ireland because of their demographic and geographic locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Some time ago, the Minister asked for alternatives. The Minister's UK counterpart implemented similar changes in accident and emergency departments throughout Britain and in Northern Ireland. A decision was taken to reverse the downgrading of the hospital in Downpatrick and that hospital is now thriving. If the Minister is serious about examining alternatives he need only look at what happened in Bath in south England and the Mid-Argyll hospital in Scotland. They are now thriving hospitals which are serving their communities particularly well.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The Minister visited New York to see the effect of the smoking ban in that city. I ask him to examine how they deliver accident and emergency services in different states in America. It does not make sense that every broken finger or cut requiring six stitches should be treated in a regional centre of excellence. That is foolish.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Hanly would have us believe that he will provide us with neurologists, rheumatologists and geriatricians. We need those specialties anyway, irrespective of whether Hanly recommends them, but they are being offered as a type of <i>quid pro quo.</i> That is wrong and it is mischievous.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Another issue talked about is that of nurse practitioners. It takes seven years to train a nurse practitioner. We already have five nurse practitioners who have to work under the guise of a consultant. These are issues that are not thrashed out in the Hanly report. This is a half-baked report and it should be withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Minister is playing it cute by putting the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, in charge of the downgrading committee. It is a bit like asking him to fall on his own sword. I call on the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, to resist the temptation. He should not accept the poisoned chalice of the Hanly report and stick to his guns.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">With the publication of the Hanly report, the latest in a long line of reports initiated by the Minister for Health and Children, the time has come for all such reports to carry a health warning. There is a danger of failing eyesight from reading the closely worded print. There is a danger of inducing back pain from carrying two or more of these reports at any time and one gets a constant feeling of nausea reading the recommendations that we know will never be implemented. This Government is causing more health problems than it is solving and if these reports are meant to do anything, it is to create a sense of goodwill and confidence that has long been lacking in the health policies of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">We now have a Taoiseach who says that the implementation of this report and all other reports is a matter of demographics and geographics. They might as well be a matter of hieroglyphics because the reality is that no one can read the signals this Government is sending out. It is sending out two, three or four different messages, depending on which member of the Cabinet is talking and the time of day.</p>

The reality is that if we want to restore public confidence in the health service we should make it smaller and more local rather than opting for centralisation and rationalisation. The services should be made more attainable to the public. They need to have the confidence to know that if anything goes wrong, it can be dealt with most readily in their local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">That is not the scope of this report nor the focus of Government health policies. The reality is that we will end up with a health service consisting of one major hospital in each health board area, and possibly just one health board. If the Government thinks that is a strategy for inspiring public confidence in health, it is mistaken. I fear it will get the first indications of the degree of public confidence in its health policy next June and I, for one, will be interested in that result.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh:</from>
          <p eId="para_459">The implementation of the European working time directive for junior hospital doctors is long overdue and to the extent that the Hanly report provides for that, it is welcome. The fact that consultant-delivered rather than consultant-led services are provided for in the Hanly report, is also to be welcomed. Both of those changes are essential if we are to improve delivery of health care to patients throughout the State but the Hanly report goes much further. It contains a fatal flaw in that it links both these changes to the downgrading of the services delivered by local hospitals throughout the country. The report does not name the hospitals which will lose services. It does not even name the hospitals in the eastern region which will lose services, even though it will be piloted.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Minister for Health and Children stated on Question Time in the House on Wednesday that there is nothing new in the emphasis in the Hanly report on the development of so-called centres of excellence. We have to go back to 1966 to find the first report on Dublin which stated that there should be three hospitals on the northside and three on the southside but consider the disaster we have in Dublin because of that. The Minister is right. There is nothing new in that. It is fine in theory to suggest we should have centres of excellence but there is chaos in the centres of excellence we already have in Dublin. There is a lack of facilities in maternity wards which means they are not fully equipped to deal with the number of patients in them. These hospitals are supposed to be centres of excellence and they cannot cope but there are hospitals throughout the country which could cope very well. All that is needed is investment to provide services at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Deputy Conor Lenihan said we should not refer to hospitals in our constituencies and that we should know about all the hospitals in the country. I know about quite a few but the ones I know best are those to which I have brought my wife, my children and my father-in-law recently and every one of them is chaotic. The small cubicle my father-in-law was in in the accident and emergency department in St. James's Hospital contained two trolleys. There is chaos in what is supposed to be a centre of excellence. We are expected to close down more hospitals and send more patients to these centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The Pollock report published earlier this year on Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin highlighted a tenfold increase in patient numbers yet there are now fewer beds than when it first opened. The Coombe Women's Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street, which is not in my constituency, and the Rotunda Hospital are bursting at the seams. They are supposed to be centres of excellence but we have closed maternity units in other hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The aspect of the Hanly report which concentrates on centres of excellence will not work. It will cause chaos throughout the country. That part of the report should be shelved. We should implement the aspects I mentioned regarding the working time directive, which is overdue, and the principle of consultant-directed services should be introduced forthwith. The Government should live up to the commitments it made to the electorate to eliminate hospital waiting lists and deliver a health service. I would like to see that happen but I do not believe it will. It definitely will not happen if the recommendations in the Hanly report are implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">I dtús báire glacaim leis an seans caint inniu ar rud chomh tábhachtach agus atá cúrsaí leighis agus cúrsaí ospidéil. Nuair a bhí me ar lorg vótaí san olltoghchán, ní raibh aon ábhar a raibh níos mó cainte faoi ná cúrsaí leighis so tá sé tábhachtach go gcuirfimid an bhéim, mar a chuir tuairisc Hanly, ar na cúrsaí sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I believe it was the late Tip O'Neill who said that all politics are local. Like most maxims, when they are subjected to closer scrutiny, we find exceptions. Today might be an exception because it is necessary from one time to another to allow the national interest to transcend local interests in order that the locality may be better served.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The culture of a people is often manifest in its language and there is an equally important maxim in Gaelic which applies to the Hanly report. It is a beautiful phrase that urban and rural people in particular who are familiar with the thrashing of long ago will remember, "Ní neart go cur le chéile – without unity we cannot have strength". The old meitheal used to come together to help the farmer on the day he most needed help. It was about the integration of farmers and farm helpers at that time. The Hanly report is about integrating a network of local, general, acute and major hospitals to work for a better patient service in an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">It is time we congratulated the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his three junior Ministers, Deputies Brian Lenihan, O'Malley and Callely, on having the courage to bring forward this report. Every Government in the past has done its best to provide a hospital service with which the generality of people will be happy – one can never make everybody happy. All Governments, including the one led by Deputy John Bruton, did their best. I was amazed – and still am – to find that the whole income tax take is spent on health. There is not a penny left for education or social welfare – it all goes on health. The health budget next year is €10 billion. It is essential that we as politicians ensure we obtain value for money. That is why it is important for us to consider the area of health care in which the Hanly report may deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I was impressed by the contributions of two Deputies this morning – I am new to this business so I am not sure from listening to the Ceann Comhairle whether one may mention Deputies or not, but I presume one may praise them.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_471">I was mindful that the Ceann Comhairle himself is also a doctúir, so I am not sure where he stands in all of this. However, Deputies Wall and English, from the Labour Party and Fine Gael, both emphasised the good points of the Hanly report. That is what politics needs, an integrated approach among ourselves to obtaining a better health service. I congratulate the Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">There are five important areas. The first is patient care. As some people know, I come from a hurling background, and I have had occasion to require medical services after training sessions that started at 7 p.m. Two years ago a young fellow broke his ankle. He was to sit exams in two days. We were lucky to have an expert orthopaedic service to which he could be brought and that it operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In my younger days, when I played myself, that was not the case. There are cases of sportsmen from every background – rugby, soccer – who were unfortunate enough not to have experts available. The Hanly report at least tries to promote the availability of specialists 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If this was all that was achieved the approach of the report would be laudable.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The second area is that of contracts. Contracts that have served consultants and patients in the past may not serve them today. I am not <i>au fait</i> with the nitty-gritty of them but it is time these contracts were revisited, from the point of view of the consultants and of the patients. It is beyond time the appalling hours worked by junior doctors were investigated. This is unbelievable, but it goes unnoticed by many of us. Their working hours, by virtue of EU diktat and the Hanly report, will be reduced to what is fair and proper. I also note from the report that their training will be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Another vital area is investment in ambulance personnel. The availability of ambulance vehicles should be investigated as well as training so that we have medical emergency technicians who are trained to an advanced level to respond when necessary in the best way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The last important area, in deference to the Tip O'Neill philosophy of all politics being local, is development of services in local hospitals. That too will receive an injection of capital, which is important. I will go further and say that non-major hospitals should also be facilitated in developing expertise in their areas. It is vital that the taxpayer obtains value for money, that junior doctors are looked after and that patients and consultants are looked after.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I return to the Tip O'Neill philosophy in saying that I have been asked by many people in my own constituency what will happen to Wexford General Hospital. The answer is that Hanly has not referred to it. We must be careful that we do not enter the area of scaremongering. My colleagues from all parties in Wexford, along with Senator Jim Walsh, meet regularly with the South-Eastern Health Board. We are dealing with major issues in Wexford – 18 new beds and an accident and emergency consultant for our hospital. We are proud of the hospital's dedicated staff. At this point, however, Hanly has not referred to the hospital, and when he does we will have an input. All local interests will be involved in a proper analysis of the needs of Wexford and the surrounding area. That is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The challenge of the Hanly report is that politicians from all parties must insist on a better patient service. It should be about patients rather than politics, especially local politics. I hope the outcome will be good for patients. Deputy Durkan asked a most important question of Deputy Conor Lenihan, with some passion. It is important to realise how emotive the issue is. That is why I congratulate the various Ministers involved. Too often emotion obliterates sense. Deputy Durkan asked Deputy Lenihan to tell us which hospitals are to close. According to Hanly, no hospital will be closed. I am sure when Deputy Durkan goes back to his constituency he will be delighted to be able to say that.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Bruton:</from>
          <p eId="para_480">Most Deputies in this debate have been praising the Hanly report while looking for so many exceptions to it as to render it meaningless. My approach is different – I question the underlying assumptions of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The report does not set out in a convincing way the evidence on which its conclusions are based. The two key arguments in the conclusions of the report are: "There is convincing evidence that the best results in treatment are achieved when patients are treated by staff working as part of a multi-disciplinary specialist team," and "Studies have shown a statistically significant link between "high volume" surgeons in "high volume" hospitals and lower death rates in hospital." In other words, Hanly argues that big hospitals provide the best means of saving lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The report does not set out the arguments in favour of this conclusion. It mentions in a tiny footnote research by Batista <i>et al,</i> Chassin <i>et al</i> and Nuffield Institute for Health. Why is this research not set out in more detail in the report? Are the public and the Members of the Dáil not educated enough to read and understand the research referred to in this almost dismissive footnote? Are we supposed to accept it on authority from the doctors that this research is right and its conclusions are proven? This research needs to be summarised in the report and set out before the Dáil, because we are well capable of reading this research and deciding whether it shows that big hospitals save more lives than small ones. Let us have an evidence-based approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The report concludes that the European working time directive, which requires a dramatic reduction in working hours, can best be met by "the appointment of more consultants working in teams" and concludes that these teams can only be constituted in a smaller number of big hospitals. Again, I am not yet convinced by Hanly's argument in favour of a consultant-led service.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Hanly rejects using non-consultant, career-grade hospital doctors for reasons of medical education. Reference is made to "various expert reports" in the UK. Again, these reports are not set out for Members to read. It is assumed that we are not smart enough to understand these expert reports which argue on grounds of medical education that only consultants and not career-grade hospital doctors should be the leading providers of services in hospitals. If the evidence if produced, I am prepared – as I am sure many Members would be – to accept even unpalatable conclusions. Although everybody has praised the Hanly report, it only sets out the evidence, not the conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The report has failed to be realistic in dealing with public transport networks serving hospitals. Hospitals that are inaccessibly located in the middle of traffic-clogged towns are not suitable for dealing with emergencies. For this reason, I am puzzled by the rationale for choosing Limerick Regional Hospital as the major centre for that region. Anyone that knows where the hospital is located will know how difficult it is to get to it at rush hour, even from the centre of Limerick. I would have thought that traffic levels and the configuration of public transport networks would have been a key consideration in the Hanly report, yet it is not referred to, any more than is the national spatial strategy. This puzzles me. We should integrate transport and health policy in a single policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Hanly concludes by paraphrasing Mrs. Thatcher's famous "TINA" dictum – there is no alternative – by saying that it had identified no realistic alternative to its proposals that would safeguard patient care. While this may be true, it has not been proven beyond doubt. Having said that, it is now for those who oppose the report to bring forward arguments that contradict the two key assumptions it makes. They must also come forward with an alternative method for complying with the EU Working Time Directive as it cannot be avoided. So far, the opponents of the report have not done this. Deputy Finneran made a strong statement and one would assume that he would disappear from Fianna Fáil if the Hanly approach is applied in Roscommon. However, neither he nor any of the other Deputies making strong statements have suggested an alternative method for dealing with the problems posed by the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Without knowing much about it, I would prefer to see an approach that uses non-consultant hospital doctors rather than a consultant-led service. The consultant-led service approach is being dictated, in part, by the professional interests in consultant grades. There is a sense that no one but them has the qualifications necessary to provide the sort of service that ought to be provided and, flowing from this, services must be centralised in big hospitals. This House should subject such assumptions to acute forensic analysis. Unfortunately, the report has not given us the evidence that would allow us to do this. Hanly has not summarised the academic research that provides the basis for the conclusions of the report. This should be part of the report and part of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I also question the overall health strategy set out in the Brennan and Prospectus reports. These propose to establish a single semi-State body to run the health service throughout the country. The Government wants to use the CIE model to run the health service at the same time as it is proposing to dismantle CIE. If this comes to pass, the Minister will not answer questions for anything that is a matter for "An Bord Sláinte" and there will be political accountability at this level. Equally, as there will be no regional health boards, there will be no accountability at that level either. It seems to be assumed that politicians are not qualified to question health policy decisions and that only medical people have the appropriate gravity and knowledge to make them. I remind the authors of the Hanly, Brennan and Prospectus reports that we are elected representatives. We take responsibility for raising the resources spent in the health service. While I have no doubt that politicians will only make the right decision when they have first tried every possible wrong decision – that we are not all that courageous is a failing of our profession – at least we are accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I am worried that as a result of this combined approach, we will have a highly centralised and unaccountable health service that will present an annual bill to the Minister for payment by the taxpayer. We will not have genuine accountability. It stems from a sense within the medical profession that others ought not to question the resource decisions they take. This goes back to clinical decisions they make for individual patients. They seem to insist on retaining the freedom to buy the more expensive treatment even when a less expensive one is available. The sense that their professional freedom should not be questioned is also applied in the wider areas such as the location of hospitals, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">We need another debate, as this one is inadequate. The academic studies must be produced, either in the House or in the relevant committee, forensically examined and the researchers need to be questioned by Deputies. Perhaps when this is done Members will accept what is best for the national interest. To paraphrase Deputy Tony Dempsey, they will come together. While Members are prepared to come together and do what is right for the country and what is right for our regions as well as for our county or constituency, we need to see the evidence first. We must be convinced of the merits of it and we cannot be taken for granted by professionals who simply cite footnotes referring to expert research from other countries without producing the research.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I hope the Government will take this approach. This is a test for the Government and for political leadership in the country. If the Government fails to deliver on a comprehensive package and is blown off course by sentiments such as those expressed from the backbenches today, it will be a failure for politics and not just for the Government. Politics is being tested in this regard. In its present form, the Hanly report is not sufficiently robust and does not contain sufficiently well argued and demonstrably valid evidence to justify the political price it may be necessary to pay. We should be presented with the evidence before we are asked to pay that price.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan:</from>
          <p eId="para_492">Deputy John Bruton has given us much food for thought with his analysis of the Hanly report. He has been critical in a fundamental and constructive way and the Government will do well to listen to the points he has raised. The points I wish to raise are probably more political, but will have a certain level of fundamentalism attached to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">My first fear of the Hanly report is that it is one in a series of reports on the health service that has been built up in recent years. When it became obvious that a general election was in the offing we were told about a ten-year plan. Due to the fact that an election was coming the Government said it needed more money. The Government recruited 29,000 additional personnel in the health service. That is a lot of recruitment. It is almost like an employment agency. Were those recruited junior hospital doctors, consultants or nursing and medical personnel?</p>

          <p eId="para_495">If that is the case I find it hard to understand why we have longer waiting lists than ever. We have waiting lists for all services except maternity services and that is because the people who require those services cannot wait.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The Government continually complains about the extra money it has spent. On which part of the health service was the money spent? Was it strategically spent or was it just thrown at the service and someone told to do what he or she could with it?</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The Eastern Health Board was the biggest health board in the country and administered services to one third of the country's population. The Government divided it into three health boards and provided an Eastern Regional Health Authority, so adding another tier. I can offer assistance as to where the money went. That is where it went. The Eastern Health Board had a chief executive officer and three programme managers, who delivered the services. They were all accessible. One could ring them up, even at night, and speak to them. They could respond to emergencies as they arose and they often did. I compliment them on that. A new tier of administration was imposed on the system and five times the number of programme managers were put in place in each of the subordinate health board areas. Now, every time one rings them up one is told they are at a meeting. Meeting and exchanging views with each other on a daily basis is now their full-time occupation. The public no longer have access to the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">On top of this expenditure the treatment purchase scheme was introduced. We send patients to Northern Ireland, to Britain, whose health service shares many of our own failings, and to France in order to get services for which we have put structures in place in our own country. Given the amount of money we have spent on the health system and the number of reports that have been created over the years, it is paradoxical that we must send patients abroad for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">It is not enough to say we did not know the population was getting bigger or that we did not have time to plan for this situation. In the old days when there were several small hospitals throughout this city it was easier to get service than it is now. I disagree with the notion that big is always better and that establishing big centres is the way to solve our difficulties. We should have learned from our experiences in the years since big hospitals replaced little ones. I appreciate the need for specialist units. However, this does not mean that we should dismiss all the smaller regional hospitals and create two or three major hospitals to deal with all issues in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Deputy John Bruton referred to traffic. At a meeting in my constituency the other night some expert decided it would take 11 minutes to go from Naas to Tallaght. If it were that easy to calculate the time of that journey surely a commuter who travels the route every morning would have come to a conclusion in that regard a long time ago. Unfortunately none of them has done so. This is what I call a desktop examination of an issue. Someone looks at a map and, on the basis of what he sees, decides that a service can be delivered in a specified time.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Hanly report will cause the downgrading of many of our good county and regional hospitals to the status of local health clinics. I do not criticise health centres. In fact, much good could be done by upgrading local health centres but this issue is not addressed in the Hanly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Deputy John Bruton drew the House's attention to references in the Hanly report to various experts in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, who believe they see things correctly. I spent 16 or 17 years on the Eastern Health Board and I hope I learned something about the health service during that time. We were always very busy but there was democracy and a local input. Under the proposed changes there will be no democracy because there will be no accountability to this House or to the public who elect it. Deputies who ask questions about the health service will be told the Minister has no responsibility for that area. If the Hanly report is implemented – and I am not convinced it will be – strict provision should be made for the Minister to be accountable for the health service to the House and obliged to answer questions on the service in the House. If the Minister provides the funding for the health service he should be accountable to the House for the way the funding is spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his elevation to the pivotal post he has been given in the engineering of health services. I am not certain which position he is likely to take up, whether defending the embattled services at hospital gate level or assisting the people who wish to gain access to the service. However, military intelligence, expertise and hardware will be impressive in that area and I hope the Minister is successful in assisting in doing what has not been done so far, namely, making a health service available to the public as and when they want it.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Certain procedures cannot wait and need to be as close to the community as possible. For several years we have been treated to pie in the sky and told that certain centres of excellence would be in particular locations and that it would be possible to reach them in a certain number of minutes. We knew what we were being told was not true. In the interest of the health service and of the people of the country, I ask all who are involved in the service to see that people get access to it, which they do not get now.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I do not believe it is intended to implement this report until after the next general election. That is my political point and I know the Minister of State is surprised I made it. Money was poured into the health system before the last general election to give the public the impression that the Government had the means to solve problems and was about to do so. The Government failed but nothing more was said until after the general election. Once again a new report has been rolled out which will take ten years to implement. At least two general elections will have been held by that time. I hate to think what is likely to have happened to the poor people of this country by the time two more general elections like that of last year have been visited upon them.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">There are 166 Members in the House so the local pieces of the jigsaw will fit into the national picture. What happens if just a few pieces of that jigsaw are missing, such as Nenagh, Ennis, Monaghan or Roscommon? We would not have a complete picture. This is not the type of health service we want. Maybe Deputy Conor Lenihan would be happy with this but I guarantee him that the remaining Members would not.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Deputy Conor Lenihan referred to Sligo General Hospital and stated that the Hanly report presents no threat to it. This is exactly as it should be, and it should remain so. Let us consider the hospital in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, where I lived for 11 years. I know from experience the value of its accident and emergency service. Two years before the Hanly report was issued, the casualty unit in Manorhamilton closed and we now have a minor injuries unit. However, the ambulance service has not been upgraded to provide the required service for north Leitrim, nor have the roads and infrastructure been improved to facilitate better access to Sligo General Hospital. Therefore, people from Rossinver to Kiltyclogher to west Cavan now face a considerable journey on bad roads because of the failure to provide the necessary upgrading of the ambulance service. Is this to be a template for the future? Is Manorhamilton hospital to be a blueprint for what we can expect? It is no wonder that those from Loop Head, Kilrush and Ennis took to the streets in their thousands to demonstrate. They are afraid they will be left with an inferior service such as that in Leitrim.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I know we need reform in the health service and that the working hours of junior doctors must be reduced. Centres of excellence can and will contribute to a better health service. However, if we are to have them, we must have equality of access across the country to basic hospital services, particularly accident and emergency services. One might ask how this could be achieved. An answer might involve considering the Government's spatial strategy, for example. In County Mayo, Ballina and Castlebar are grouped together in such a way that they can pool their resources, expertise and strength to create a critical mass for development. Could the same not apply to Nenagh, Ennis and Limerick, for example? We are told nine consultants are needed to run a good and proper accident and emergency service. However, all nine do not have to be employed in Limerick on a full-time basis. Their contracts could stipulate that they work two or three days in Ennis or Nenagh. In other words, we should move the consultants and not the patients. Similarly, this might work in the case of Roscommon and Portiuncula or that of Cavan and Monaghan. We need some lateral thinking and should start from the premise that the service is for the patient, whose needs are paramount. Although top-class medical care is critical, so also is access. We need a balance between the two.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The real problem with the Hanly report, which is excellent in many ways, is that it is unbalanced. We are told we cannot accept it in part and that we must accept all or nothing. This makes no sense. We need to take what is best and discard the rest in the interest of patients. The report, like many other reports, is too centralised in its thinking. It is not true to say that bigger is necessarily better, yet this idea permeates the report. It does not strike a proper balance where access is concerned. We need a system that ensures that, whether one lives in Manorhamilton, Ennis, Monaghan or Roscommon, one has equality of access with those in Limerick, Cork and Sligo.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan):</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the Hanly report and to outline the Government's perspective on it. It is important to realise that the Government has a very definite line of policy on the health service, with two crucial pillars. One is to invest in the services and the other is to bring about significant reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">We have to recall the investment that has been made in the health service. The past six years have seen a huge increase in additional spending on health care, capital projects, staff, as Deputy Durkan mentioned, and the day-to-day operation of the different services concerned. An increasing number of patients have benefited from these additional services and it is worth recalling that the volume of activity in our hospitals has increased dramatically in recent years. There has been a huge increase in the number of treatments and procedures being carried out and this is the result of a very substantial increase in investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Of course the Government, under the Constitution, has to propose and agree the investments, through this House, but ultimately those moneys are voted by all of us to the health service. Deputy Tony Dempsey stated this afternoon that all the income tax receipts of the State are now committed to the Department of Health and Children. This is a matter on which we all have to focus our sense of responsibility. Of course we have had a very far-ranging debate, from the local to the national. As Deputy Tony Dempsey pointed out, all politics is local, a point later echoed by Deputy Harkin. Naturally, Deputies are concerned about the provision and range of services available in their immediate localities. Many of them have direct experience of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Unfortunately, Deputy Connolly opened a particular episode that was investigated in great detail. There were never the facilities in Monaghan Hospital to deal with the type of case about which such public discussion took place last winter.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">I very much welcome the fact that Deputy John Bruton, in his contribution, called for an evidence-based approach. One of the difficulties we have in debating health issues in the House is that the health service, historically, was not run on the basis of incentivisation but on the basis of block allocations of money by the Department of Health and Children to certain agencies. In other words, it is run they way the economy of the old Soviet Union was run. Deputies of all parties fall into the trap of thinking we can manage the service following political instincts, and I would not single out any Deputy of any party, from any era, for doing so. We have invested very substantial—</p>
