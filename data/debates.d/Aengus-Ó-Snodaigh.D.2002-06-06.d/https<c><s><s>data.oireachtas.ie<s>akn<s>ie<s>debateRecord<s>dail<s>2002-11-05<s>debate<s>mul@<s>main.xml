        </question>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">On 25 July the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I attended the plenary meeting to monitor implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. All the social partners were represented at the meeting and its purpose was a review of progress and plans under the broad headings of Social Inclusion and Equality. Action in these areas on a Department by Department basis, and under the NDP, formed a key part of the presentation to the plenary meeting. In addition, the extensive policy framework, which has been developed to deliver social inclusion and equality, was considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">As part of the formal launch of the talks on a successor agreement to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I also attended the PPF plenary meeting in Dublin Castle on Thursday last, together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. Again, all the social partners were represented at the meeting and its primary purpose was to begin the process of considering the nature and scope of a new agreement. A presentation on the economic outlook in the medium term also featured. The meeting also provided an opportunity for us all, Government and social partners alike, to outline the priority concerns which we will each bring to the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I emphasised, with my colleagues, the Government's continued strong commitment to pursuing our nation's wellbeing and prosperity through the process of social dialogue. To that end, I made clear that the Government is in absolutely no doubt that a renewed consensus in a new social partnership agreement is in the best interests of all our people. At the same time, I felt it necessary to caution against sectional interests being pursued at the expense of the wider community. I also reiterated my remarks at the PPF plenary in July when I said that I would be inviting organisations to participate in negotiations on a new agreement in the context that the Government will enter talks on the basis of An Agreed Programme for Government. I also made it clear that those organisations invited to participate in the talks do so on the basis that social partnership brings rights and responsibilities, that these are exercised in a spirit of mutual respect and respect for the primacy of the democratic process and that what is agreed must reflect the objective needs of the whole community and the necessary accountability for public policy and public funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The formal plenary meetings complement those which I hold with representatives of the social partners on a regular basis. In this respect, I met representatives of the main farming organisations on 5 July to discuss a number of issues of concern, including the decline in farm incomes, the proposed mid-term review of the CAP and the referendum on the Nice treaty. After the meeting the Government acknowledged that while farm families are experiencing income difficulties, we have no doubt that the expansion of the European Union will provide significant opportunities for Irish farmers and the agri-business sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">My Department exercises the main co-ordinating role for overall implementation of the programme as well as supporting a range of cross-departmental issues, such as public service modernisation, infrastructure delivery, social inclusion and the information society. My Department also chairs the national implementation body established under the adjustments to the terms of the PPF in December 2000. This body continues to meet as necessary to consider, in particular, the potential implications of any ongoing disputes of special national importance. It also provides  opportunities for informal discussion of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process, from the employer and trade union perspectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Deputy Rabbitte asked for my views on the prospect of another national agreement to replace the PPF. As I have said many times before, including my most recent remarks at the last plenary meeting, I believe the series of agreements we have had since 1987 have played a very significant role in the radical transformation of this country's economic and social fortunes in the recent past. The issues confronting all of us today, whether in terms of management of the public finances, competitiveness, social cohesion or environmental sustainability, are complex and interdependent and require a collective response. In this respect, I am encouraged by the formal announcements from the social partners at the plenary meeting on Thursday last that they will enter into talks with the Government on a new national agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The reality, however, is that general economic conditions are tighter now than they have been at any point in the last five years. The international environment has become dramatically more challenging in recent months and the outlook is, to say the least, uncertain. The competitiveness agenda has become much more demanding, as recent job losses have underlined. The inevitable impact on the public finances has become sharply evident in recent weeks and months. Therefore, it is important that realism should guide us all. As I said at last week's PPF plenary meeting, we have it in our own hands, to a large degree, to determine how the economy will perform in the coming years. However, in order to secure an agreed outcome, it will be imperative that expectations should keep in line with current economic realities. This is the key challenge now being presented to the process of social partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">The National Economic and Social Council is in the final stages of completing its three yearly overview of economic and social developments and policy. I expect that the key recommendations will be agreed within a matter of days, followed shortly afterwards by finalisation and publication of the detailed strategy report. This report, with the Government's programme, will act as a guiding strategic framework for the negotiations on a social partnership programme to succeed the PPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">In addition, the council is undertaking work on the following three reports: the management of public expenditure; regional development in a cross-Border context – a case study of the north west – and a review of strategic options in taxation and social welfare. Soon after completion of its strategy report, the council will define its work programme for the coming years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Will the Taoiseach outline his assessment of the importance to the economy of the successful completion of another agreement? Does he consider that one will be achieved, given  the glacial nature of the recent confrontation between the social partners? Does he agree that the current structure of the agreement is capable of dealing with the range of complex circumstances that now apply? Does he also agree that the true state of the public finances should be made available to each partner before negotiations on a new agreement commence? Will he indicate the reason, following a request by my party under the Freedom of Information Act, only one Department has replied under the terms of the Act within the 28 day deadline set down? Two weeks after the deadline eight Departments have failed to respond. In fairness to all the parties it is necessary that the true state of the public finances be available to them before they enter into serious negotiations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_29">There are a number of answers in reply to Deputy Kenny. The concept of social partnership is vitally important to the economy. Likewise, if we are to continue to make progress, as has been done in good times and bad, such a system is necessary. Social partnership has been of enormous benefit and allowed us to get over what seemed to be insurmountable difficulties. The last agreement had four pillars operating and the others had three pillars. The process with its dialogue and quarterly reports was always useful and that is no different now in more difficult times.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">With regard to the structure of the partnership, each agreement has been arranged differently. The plenaries are a constant but the type of report differs. The PPF consists of an enormous amount of sub-groups and it was the same in Partnership 2000, but not in earlier programmes. It is my view that the present one has been too cumbersome due to its many working groups. This point was cited by the social partners themselves as it takes an enormous amount of their effort and resources to service them. I agree with the general secretary of ICTU, David Begg, who said that we would be better to take a number of strategic and important areas on which to focus rather than taking 170 as we did in the last programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">In terms of the information available, as I said in my reply, a presentation was made last week by the Department of Finance on the economic outlook. It was full and complete and is available. I understand Deputy Kenny is talking about what is available under FOI. I will ask my colleagues about it and make the presentation available to him, if he has not already received it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_32">Does the Taoiseach agree that we should not be in our current economic position and that we would not be in it if the Government had properly managed its affairs on behalf of the nation? How does the Taoiseach propose to negotiate an agreement with workers given that his Government has frittered away a €4,800 million surplus into a €1 billion deficit?</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Does the Taoiseach agree that at the conclusion of a new agreement, it will be necessary to implement quality public services and deliver all the commitments in the Government's programme in terms of the national health strategy? Does he further agree that there is a great deal of unease and concern and that the talks are being undermined by growing union discontent about redundancy payments, and will he make a statement on the matter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_34">I will make my replies in reverse order. The issue of redundancy payments has been debated in this House a number of times. The trade union movement has made clear that it is looking for a substantial change in their structure. The Minister, Deputy Harney, has already presented the interim report and said that the detailed discussions on that will hopefully come to a satisfactory conclusion. An updated scheme of redundancy payments will be implemented as part of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Deputy Kenny is correct in regard to the difficulties with the financial situation, which is now more difficult than it has been in the past number of years, and certainly more difficult than it was in 1999 when the discussions for the last talks took place. I do not believe the Government is responsible on the whole for that. The Government played its part but this position has been the result of the domestic and international situation, about which the Deputy will be well aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">We were able to continue to maximise and improve public services at a fast rate when the economy was growing at the order it was but that has declined over the past two years. The economy grew by 12% during the first quarter of last year, 9% in the second quarter, 3.8% in the third quarter and 0.1% in the final quarter and that trend has continued so that economic growth this year will be around 3% of GNP and more than 4% of GDP. That has meant that we cannot continue providing public expenditure increases in the order of 20% because income has only risen by 4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">We have to alter our course. It was right when the economy was strong to put resources into building public services because they had been allowed to suffer over many years. However, this can only be done when resources are available and that was the case. For example, five years ago we were spending €3.7 billion on health whereas now we are spending €8.5 billion. Nobody will argue that the 122% increase in health spending, the 186% increase in capital infrastructure spending or the average increase of 91% in spending on public services was unjustified over that five-year period. The reality was we had resources to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The position is different now. The international climate is different and competitiveness has become a key issue again. Our export markets are not performing as well as they were because the economies of the countries to whom we export are not growing at the same rate they were. We  have to trim our own sails and cut back public expenditure to more realistic levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">With regard to Deputy Kenny's question on borrowing, on budget day last year the Minister for Finance estimated a small surplus for this year, which will not happen because revenue continued to decline during the year, including in the latest figures published yesterday. This means the figures outlined by the Minister for Finance on budget day last year for a small surplus this year, a deficit of almost €3 billion next year and an increased deficit the following year could be higher. That is a fact of life which we must manage. The economy is in a more healthy condition than those of many other countries and the important thing now is that we manage it for this period as prudently and carefully as we can until international markets pick up again so that when things turn, as they always do, we will be ready to take off again.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">If it is the case that the Government wants another social contract, why did it take a position at the opening of the national pay agreement talks that was described by the vice-president of SIPTU at his conference in Galway last weekend as not only taking the trade unions aback in terms of its bias but it also so took aback IBEC that it had to amend its statement to the effect that it was seeking a pay pause? He told the conference they had not taken that position in private discussions, but that as a result of the position taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, they were now seeking a pay pause. If the Taoiseach wants an agreement, is that the best way to leverage the parties towards one?</p>

          <p eId="para_47">Last week marked the start of the discussions. It is vitally important for every side to outline a frank position. It is not correct to say anyone amended their position. As regards  the Government side, I set out a fair position of what social partnership has done over the past 15 years and what it has achieved through all the programmes, including the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, PESP, the PCW, Partnership 2000 and the PPF. I outlined where we are now and the difference compared to where we were three years ago in the autumn and winter of 1999 when we negotiated the PPF. I also set out the financial position. The Government side outlined where we were on public service pay during the discussions. We reiterated the position that the cost of benchmarking of up to 25% back to December of last year, to which we are committed, was approximately €290 million. It will cost approximately €230 million to €240 million to pay this on an annual basis. It will cost €1.1 billion to meet benchmarking alone on a full year term before we come to a round. These figures are in addition to a public service pay bill which is already €12 billion. When I put the figures in this form, it made people sit up. However, they are not new. That is the factual position. We must deal with these issues in the negotiations. As Deputy Kenny said, it is better to be frank in such discussions. I took the opportunity to outline the difficulties in order that we can have meaningful discussions in the next number of weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">Individual groups who have difficulties with trade unions and management will always use free collective bargaining to resolve these issues. As always, I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy on the broader question of social partnership. Irish workers are working because of social partnership. We now have 1.75 million people in work, 600,000 of whom joined the workforce in recent years. The current agreement is well on the way to achieving the target increase of 24% or more in take home pay. The tax burden of workers has been reduced, their facilities are better and their future, in most instances, has continued to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">The old way was to make sure they participated in social partnership in some other country. As always, I disagree with the Deputy's concept. The fact that Irish workers have more security and are able to move forward, even in more difficult times, is better than the previous position. Of course, I do not deny there are individual cases where employers exploit or create difficulties.  These must always be addressed which is the reason we have State mechanisms to do so.</p>

I congratulate Deputy Rabbitte on becoming the second party leader, after myself, to be elected by the full membership of his party. I join him in appealing to other parties to widen their democratic base by allowing the election of their leaders using this system.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The Taoiseach stated that all social partners attended the recent meeting. The environmental social partners did not attend the meeting because they are not allowed to do so. This position should be reviewed given the crisis in the area these groups represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">With regard to the balance of payments, which is obviously a central point of discussion at the partnership talks, has the Taoiseach considered recent proposals to broaden the tax base as a way of bringing about more agreement among the social partners, for example, by raising corporation tax to 17.5% as favoured by CORI, the ESRI and my party? This would still ensure Ireland remains very competitive. Has he considered another CORI recommendation, namely, the introduction of a land rent tax? I ask him to examine proposals to introduce a tax on currency transactions, which are supported by many overseas development bodies, and to levy eco-taxes which have been discussed but not acted on. Is the Taoiseach bringing these to the negotiating table and is he going to bow to the wisdom of dropping the special savings scheme given that it costs €500 million a year? That money is going untaxed. Will the Taoiseach ensure that everybody takes considerable action to bring about agreement?</p>

Alternative ways of broadening the financing mechanisms will hopefully be discussed, which is what has happened over a number of programmes with good progress being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I do not know to what extent there can be consensus on broadening the tax base, but it is desirable that it happens beyond the extension of rates as the Deputy mentioned. Ways must be sought of looking at tax shelters, allowances, exemptions or systems which allow people to profit themselves but not the Exchequer by sheltering their taxable income. Those ways will hopefully come up in the discussions. They will certainly come up in the preparation of the budget with regard to the ongoing fiscal position, particularly in terms of the environmental taxes which Deputy Sargent  has raised a number of times. As always, the Minister is looking at bringing those forward and is supportive of a number of those issues. However, no decisions have been made as yet.</p>

The revised national anti-poverty strategy and the new terms for that over the next few years are designed to deal with the issues raised  by the Deputy, the objective of which is to try to help the people concerned. Figures will show that the numbers in real poverty have been halved in the past five years. It will be more difficult to continue to reduce those figures at the rate they have been reduced. When the figures for this year or for the past five years are benchmarked against figures for previous years, the Deputy will appreciate the enormous progress that has been made.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">The decisions that will form budget 2003 have yet to be taken. The Book of Estimates is being prepared and can be debated when it is published. To answer the Deputy's question fairly and squarely, the position is that as far back as June, based on figures for the first  half of the year, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance believed that the outcome for this year would be in line with budget day targets which would be achieved from the revenue side provided the Government could control the expenditure side, by adhering to the 14.5% figure, which we are endeavouring to do, admittedly with difficulty in spite of the adjustments made, having regard to the 19.6% figure revealed in the figures published yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I do not want to return to the argument about what happened mid-year. Public expenditure increased significantly this year and what happened cannot be declared a cutback. In some areas, health in particular, figures were adjusted from one Department to another, but there has continued to be an enormous increase in public expenditure. There will also have to be an increase in public expenditure next year, but it will have to be at a far more moderate level if we are to remain competitive and to keep matters in order, which would be the wish of the Government and, I am sure, most right thinking people.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">As we move towards the end of the year we have to continue to keep expenditure as tight as possible. We must note the reality of the base figure and realise that we are achieving income increases in the order of only 4%. The tax receipts published today were 2.3% higher than for the corresponding period last year compared to a budget target of an increase of 8.6% for the year as a whole. The year-on-year VAT income shows an increase of 12%, income tax is down by 9.3%, corporation tax is up by 7.3% and excise duties are up by 8.6% for the ten month period. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, it is a long way short of what the expected figures were for this year. As is normal, unless there is some immediate change in the international position – which I do not foresee, nor is it forecasted by the Government or independent bodies – the base figure we have now will continue into 2003. If we are to remain competitive we will have to adjust to that position. That is the position we will have to look at in the four weeks between now and the budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Can we take it the Government does not support the IBEC position of a pay pause in the private sector? In the context of the Taoiseach's belief that his Government bears no responsibility for the deterioration in the public finances, does it mean that he will focus on strictly non-pay items in a new social contact? Is the Government prepared to introduce legislation to amend the Redundancy Payments Acts, which go back to 1967? The Taoiseach concedes that the rate of job losses now is about twice what it was this time last year and many workers are being thrown out of work on a basic redundancy of a half-week's pay per year of service plus an additional week's pay. The same applies to trade union recognition legislation, where trade unions do not have the right to representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">The Taoiseach gave a commitment to Deputy Sargent that he is always prepared to review tax shelters and breaks etc. Will the Taoiseach's review include the revocation of the measure that he introduced to benefit Mr. Ken Rohan, a supporter of his party? Is he prepared to review the legislation relating to tax exile status which he introduced in 1994 to make it easier for those living abroad and not paying tax here to visit more frequently, bestow requests on the natives and spend time at race meetings? Is he prepared to ask the Minister for Finance to look at industries that are entirely tax exempt and whether industries, such as the bloodstock industry, might not be able to bear a modest tax without the stallions following their owners abroad?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_65">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_112">Sixteen investigations into company law related matters have been initiated by the Tánaiste since she entered office in her previous term as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and  Employment. In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Tánaiste, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday, 10 June 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited section 8 inquiries are continuing. A further interim report was presented to the High Court on 24 July 2002. It is anticipated the final report will be submitted to the High Court in the first half of 2003. As in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the question of whether the reports are published is entirely a matter for the High Court. The High Court ordered the publication of the Ansbacher report.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Eleven investigations were initiated by the Tánaiste under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 and five of these have been concluded. Of the five investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. The file in one case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The Department is considering whether this report should be referred to other authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Four investigations under section 19 are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"><i>Additional information</i>Reports in respect of two of these four investigations are at a very advanced stage of completion. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June 2002. The High Court ruled on certain constitutional issues which had been referred back to the High Court by the Supreme Court. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on these latter investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to €9.6 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is  being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this €9.6 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 – National Irish Bank at €4.8 million and Ansbacher at €3.5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001. In respect of the Ansbacher investigation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented a motion to the High Court in July 2002 seeking to have Ansbacher and seven other companies dealt with in the inspectors' report made liable for the costs of the investigation. Consideration of this motion is ongoing before the High Court.</p>

When is the NIB report likely to be concluded? Has the Minister a view on who should pay the costs of the Ansbacher Cayman report, which came before the House in July?</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_122">With regard to the Anbacher (Cayman) Limited report, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented a motion to the High Court in July 2002 seeking to have Ansbacher and seven other companies dealt with in the inspectors' report made liable for the costs of the report. The seven companies are Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Guiness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Guinness Mahon and Company Limited, London, Henry Ansbacher Holdings plc, Cement Roadstone Holdings plc, Bank of Ireland Private Banking Limited and Irish Investment Bank. Consideration of the motion was deferred to October 2002. The costs of the report are estimated at €3.5 million approximately.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">The matter came before the courts on 14 October 2002. John Gordon SC for Ansbacher told the court that Ansbacher believed the Minister should also seek costs from the Central Bank and wanted the court to join the Central Bank as a third party to the Minister's motion. Ansbacher argued that it had taken over the Ansbacher bank only in 1988 but that the Central Bank had been aware of problems in the bank 15 years before that and was among the entities criticised in the inspectors' report. The question of the inclusion of the Central Bank came up for hearing on 1 November but I do not yet have information on that. The Minister maintains that the costs should be paid by Ansbacher.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">I welcome the fact that the Minister is pursuing costs in this matter and I hope the same will happen with the other reports. The Minister of State's reply did not give much more  information than the Tánaiste gave on 21 March, the last time she answered questions on this matter. That is a long time ago and little progress has been made. Does the Minister agree that these inquiries are taking a considerable period of time and are incurring more costs than is necessary? Does he accept that the costs incurred to date are enormous and that action needs to be taken by the Department and the courts to bring the inquiries to a conclusion as soon as possible?</p>

          <p eId="para_125">The costs are substantial and amount to approximately €9.6 million at present. However, it is important to remember that the costs will be sought from the companies that are involved.</p>

      the level of the most recent annual block Department grants to industry allocated to IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise development scheme; and the effective cost per new job created in each of these areas.
      [20443/02]

        </question>
        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_127">I assume the Deputy is referring to grants to industry allocated to these agencies as set out under subheads C2, D2 and G1 of my Department's Vote and as published in the Revised Book of Estimates for 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">The allocations set out were as follows. Under subhead C2, for IDA Ireland grants to industry, the allocation was €87.398 million. The cost per job created and sustained by IDA Ireland over the seven year period 1995-2001 was €13,375. Under subhead D2, for Enterprise Ireland grants to industry, the allocation was €76.595 million. The cost per job created and sustained by Enterprise Ireland during 2001 was €8,977. Under subhead G1, for county enterprise boards, the allocation was just over €14 million. In 2001, the latest year for which figures are available, the average cost per job created by the county enterprise boards was €4,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">It should be noted that the actual payment of grants is a function of the demand by companies for financial support, that is, it is demand led rather than supply driven. During the course of the year it became apparent that, owing to the slowdown of the economy, the actual draw down by indigenous and FDI companies would be less than the original provision and that demands elsewhere in the economy might require the transfer of some portion of these funds. The need also to invest substantially in research, technology and innovation led, in the case of Enterprise Ireland, to some of these funds being transferred for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Accordingly, in the case of IDA Ireland, the allocated amount for grants to industry currently stands at €74.398 million and in the case of  Enterprise Ireland the corresponding amount is €69.395 million. Some of IDA Ireland's and Enterprise Ireland's expenditure would also be met from its own resources by agreement with my Department and the Department of Finance. When 2001 outturn figures for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are compared with 2002 allocations the actual levels of grants to industry for these agencies remain constant.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_131">Much greater funding is being made available to international inward investors while similar funds have never been offered to Irish businesses. Surely now is the time to create a level playing pitch when encouraging economic development and job creation. More than €13,000 is required to create a job through IDA Ireland compared with just under €9,000 per job through Enterprise Ireland. It should be a prerequisite that agencies ensure matching funding for job creation, particularly if the cost per job is cheaper, as it is in the case of Irish companies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_72" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_132">It is a fact, as the figures show, that the cost of job creation through IDA Ireland is more expensive than through Enterprise Ireland. That is because foreign investment is more expensive to attract. However, a significant number of prestigious jobs have been created in this economy in recent years as a result of international investment. While the cost of jobs is higher, the level of investment is considerably higher as well. It is not correct, therefore, to say there is any discrimination against Irish enterprise or any effort to pay less to Irish enterprise. It costs less for Irish enterprise to create jobs. However, the trend has been downward in the past number of years both in the case of Irish enterprise and foreign investment. That is a welcome trend. The cost per job has reduced, in the case of Enterprise Ireland, from €14,867 in 1988 to €8,977 in the five year period up to 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">There is no question of discrimination or of an inadequate amount being made available through Enterprise Ireland.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_134">A total of 80% of jobs in the State are created by indigenous industry employing ten or fewer people, a fact recently stated by the ESRI. If that is the case, the cost difference, as outlined by the Minister, is more than €4,000 per job. The facts speak for themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">The cost per job to Enterprise Ireland has never been an issue. The Deputy is wrong to assume the level of finance for job creation by Irish companies is less than it should be.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">The main features of the reform programme for the insurance industry, which the Tánaiste announced on 25 October 2002, are: the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by the Tánaiste, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; the publication of an action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and the publication of the report of the implementation group of the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">An indicative, non-exhaustive list of tasks for the interim PIAB was attached to the press release about my reform programme, which was issued on 25 October 2002. The interim PIAB would clearly be free to add to that list in drawing up its work programme. The question of powers, as opposed to tasks, will come into play when the PIAB is being set up on a statutory basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_139">It is an appalling state of affairs that a major enterprise centre in Dublin, the Liffey Trust, which burned to the ground recently, had no insurance cover. It sustained about 250 jobs and 40 businesses. Its founder, Mr. Séamus McDermott, has said that he could not secure insurance for the building, which will cost €7 million to replace. Perhaps the City Enterprise Board and the Minister of State's Department will have to find some of that funding. It is appalling that we have reached this juncture in dealing with insurance matters. Does the Minister of State agree that the key responsibility for this rests with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney? For five and a half years she has dithered and done nothing about the most important problem facing the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">As I told Dublin City Council yesterday, it is time the Tánaiste resigned over her handling of the insurance industry, which constitutes a desperate state of affairs. I am a director of a number of small business centres in Dublin, a number of which are faced with the same difficulties in obtaining insurance cover. Every headmaster and school board of management has the same problem, as do parents of young drivers. The insurance issue is affecting the economy across the board, yet the Tánaiste has spent almost six years doing nothing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">At the very least, the Tánaiste should ask the Equality Authority to investigate premium costs for young drivers. As a result of the first report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, chaired  by Ms Dorothea Dowling, we know that young men and women are being ripped off in a grotesque manner. The Tánaiste should order the Equality Authority to investigate this matter and produce a report on it urgently.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_142">It is the responsibility of every enterprise to ensure it has insurance cover. Nobody can offer any excuse for an enterprise which does not ensure it has basic insurance cover. While we all sympathise with the loss suffered by the Liffey Trust, it is highly irresponsible for any enterprise, be it public or private, to leave itself without some basic insurance cover.</p>

A clear timeframe for its implementation has been set out. A clear set of objectives has also been set out concerning a significant number of the MIAB's 67 recommendations. I am satisfied that the Tánaiste's efforts will yield results in helping to tackle the very high insurance costs about which we are all concerned. Some enterprises find it extremely difficult to get insurance.</p>

It is a ludicrous target to have set. When will the Personal Injuries Assessment Board be established on a statutory basis? Does the Department have any views or policies on the recent proposals from the Irish Insurance Federation, which I think are reasonable, regarding a book of quantum affidavits, and the Bacon report for the Bar Council, which has also suggested important legal reforms?</p>

The Deputy will agree, however, that for the first time the root causes of high insurance costs have been identified. These are now the subject of 67 recommendations. The stakeholder responsibility has been identified and an implementation timeframe set down. My Department's officials are working  to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis. A number of other initiatives are also under way, including the study being undertaken by the Department and the Competition Authority. The specific areas mentioned by the Deputy are covered in the recommendations. The action plan will address the issues he has raised.</p>

      her views on comments from the Insurance Industry Federation indicating that insurance costs may not be reduced in the light of the reforms that she has initiated; the action she intends taking to compel the insurance companies to compete and reduce premia as a consequence of her initiatives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_152">The Tánaiste announced a programme for fundamental insurance reform on 25 October 2002. While EU law would prevent the Tánaiste and the Department from compelling insurance companies to reduce premia, it has been made clear that there is an onus on the insurance industry to ensure the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">On the question of competition, the Tánaiste expects the study to be undertaken jointly by the Department and the Competition Authority to provide important pointers as to the reasons there are not more foreign insurers willing to underwrite insurance in Ireland.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_154">It appears the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment allowed insurance company mergers to take place without a whimper. This has created deep-seated unease among consumers because of the small number of companies now quoting for insurance – only four compared to 17 or 18 previously. In the reform package she announced on 25 October, it was indicated that a Personal Injuries Assessment Board would be established, but that will not happen for 18 months during which time an interim board will operate. In other words, in that time, nothing will happen to reduce the cost of litigation or bring awards into line with those in our neighbouring jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">In her press release the Tánaiste indicated she would bring about a 31% reduction in insurance premia over three years. How will she achieve this? Did she have any discussions to reach agreement with the Insurance Industry Federation for a <i>quid pro quo</i> concerning the various measures it should take in response to her initiatives?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_156">Neither the Tánaiste nor the Government as a whole can force the insurance industry to set its premia. In addition, this country cannot hold back the worldwide rationalisation process in the industry which simply mirrors what  is happening here. The reason there is not more competition here is that it is not a profitable market for the insurance industry. The initiative being taken by the Department and the Competition Authority will examine the reasons the insurance market has not been profitable, and tackle the problems involved in line with the MIAB's 67 recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">A specific timeframe for delivery has been outlined on which the interim PIAB will deliver over the next 18 months. It would be incorrect for the Deputy to suggest otherwise. The stakeholder responsibility for delivery, and the associated timeframe, is clearly set out in the action plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The insurance industry has been asked to respond to those initiatives, particularly that being taken in respect of the cost of claims, including processing, legal and medical costs etc., which are all being tackled. The action plan, as the Deputy stated, suggests there has been a 31% increase and underlines the assumptions on which this figure is based. Therefore, there is no reason to believe we cannot achieve that reduction of 31%.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">In addition, in the area for which I have responsibility, namely, health and safety, it is quite clear that there is a very considerable level of fraudulent claims being made in this country. We, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, intend to bring about a number of immediate initiatives to deal with fraudulent claims and, in particular, to deal with claims in the area of public liability which, as we have seen with some recent very high profile cases, are causing insurance costs to be much higher than they should be.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_160">The Minister of State has indicated that the Minister received no agreement whatsoever with the insurance companies and that, in return for the reform package and measures the companies were seeking from the Oireachtas in terms of legislative and health and safety changes and legislation to deal with fraudulent claims, which I support, they have promised to do nothing. In other words, we are getting nothing in return, except the Minister urging the insurance companies to do X, Y and Z. This is the most politically naive act on behalf of the Minister and the Government that I have seen in my time in the Oireachtas, to expect a major reform package to be put in place and not to get any return at all or any deal with the insurance companies in response to the measures urgently required to reduce insurance premia to consumers, motor owners and businesses. She did not even get a measure of solidarity from the insurance companies that they would, in turn, spell out exactly in a proper timescale what action they would take to meet the objectives of a 31% reduction in premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The Minister, in speaking about insurance companies reducing premia by such figures, is in cloud cuckoo land when there has been no deal made with them whatsoever and no guarantee  that she will get any action from the insurance companies arising from this reform package. Would the Minister of State agree that it is the greatest form of political naivety to expect the insurance companies to act at the urgings of a Government or a politician at a time when this House is expected to make certain legislative changes they seek in order to reduce the cost of litigation, claims, compensation awards, etc.? Would he agree that if we bring in those measures they will effectively tell the Minister and the Government to go to hell?</p>

          <p eId="para_162">Premia in the future, as in the past, will be determined by a combination of the underlying claims experience and the competitive conditions that apply. Even the persuasive powers of somebody like Deputy Hogan would not be sufficient to overcome that fundamental point.</p>

The fact is that Ireland is the most claims conscious society in Europe. There are much higher levels of damages being paid out in Ireland because of our legal system and we must change that.</p>

      <b>Mr. Morgan</b>
      asked the

      the number of employment task forces in which her Department or the agencies responsible to it have been involved; the locations of the task forces; the accumulated costs; the number still operating; and the audit which has been done to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of jobs saved or created and costs incurred.

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_170">Since mid 1997, 19 task forces were established under the aegis of the Department to address major company closures and job losses. There is a tabular statement to accompany this reply which lists the task forces in question and it will be included in the Official Report. The Laois task force is the only one listed which is still  operational but it is expected to complete its work within the next few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">These task forces addressed a wide range of issues and focused in particular on attracting replacement industry; assisting the expansion of existing industry and the provision of advice on alternative employment opportunities; training and re-training for workers affected; and infrastructure. State development agencies, local authority and local industry, and worker interests generally constituted the membership of task forces. Follow-up action on the task force reports has been pursued by relevant Departments, State agencies, local authorities, county development boards, and private sector and other interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The administrative costs of task forces and the implementation costs of task force recommendations were generally met from the overall Estimates resource allocations to the agencies and other bodies involved, for example, Departments and local authorities, and from private sector funding. A figure for the accumulated costs of task forces is not readily available.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">A cost-benefit evaluation of these task forces has not been undertaken by my Department. However, based on the operational experience with task forces, the general conclusion is that, overall, they provided an effective co-ordinated response to major company closures.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The State development agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies, including the relevant county development board and county council, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. This existing co-operative framework has been enhanced with the establishment of county development boards on which the State agencies are represented, and can be used effectively to address major job losses in the regions.</p>

Does he agree that we need to support and reward indigenous industry when it engages in research and development strategies which will develop long-term sustainable employment and training and development, and that this approach would be much more effective in preventing the need for all of these so-called task forces in the first instance?</p>

          <p eId="para_237">As I said earlier, a cost-benefit evaluation of these task forces has not been undertaken by my Department, but there was a report from all the agencies such as FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the county enterprise boards and Shannon Development. All these are involved at ground level, and have been so involved over the past number of years especially. They have been very successful in finding alternative jobs such as in the case of Drogheda and also in Dundalk, where there is a new business park, which is being set up by the Dundalk Institute of Technology and the IDA  and which involves FÁS and all the local agencies. These local agencies understand the problems at local level. They have the experience and knowledge of what is available in the areas and can have a "hands on" effect. That is the way to go forward. It has proved successful in many areas throughout the country. When task forces were first set up some years ago, experts were brought in without the agencies being actively involved, but over time it has been seen that these agencies understand and know the problems in the localities and have proved very effective and successful in recent years.</p>

      <b>Mr. Penrose</b>
      asked the

      the number of deaths and injuries reported during 2001 as a result of accidents in the construction industry; the numbers reported to date in 2002; the figures for the equivalent period in 2001; when the promised amendments to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, will be introduced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [20365/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_244">Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health – known as  the health and safety authority – is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I have, however, been informed by the authority that, as reported to 31 October 2002, there were 23 construction related fatalities in 2000 of which 15 were workers in the construction sector, four were workers in other sectors involved in construction activities and four were members of the public. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to the authority for 2001 was 1,305.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The number of construction related fatalities reported to date for the period 1 January to 31 October 2002 is 15, of which 14 were workers in the construction sector and one was a worker in another sector involved in construction activities. The number of accidents, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date for the period 1 January to 31 October 2002 is 852. In this context it should be noted that there is often a timelag in the reporting of such accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Proposals to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 have been developed at departmental level and are the subject of legal drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The opportunity is being taken to carry out a detailed revision of the current legislative framework dealing with occupational health and safety and I expect to be in a position to introduce a safety, health and welfare at work Bill in early 2003.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_248">Is it not extraordinary that the Department has been talking about a new health and safety Bill for the last five years? The Labour Party drafted such a Bill, which included a provision for mandatory safety representatives, three years ago. We are still waiting for the Bill. Is it not disappointing that there appears to have been more deaths in the construction industry this year than last year? Does this not show that the Government's policies are not working so far? Is it not essential, therefore, that the Government introduce legislation to make mandatory safety training and mandatory safety representatives on each building site a key feature of the construction industry?</p>
          <p eId="para_249">What is the current position regarding the number of health and safety authority inspectors available to carry out inspections of sites, given the ongoing complaints Deputies hear from workers? Does the Minister of State agree that sometimes the most tragic cases happen on very small sites where the basic safety conditions are not adhered to? What can the Minister of State do about these smaller sites?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_250">Any death is one too many. This is particularly so in the construction sector, in view of its bad record. I agree that there are far too  many deaths in the construction sector. However, we must recognise that there have been considerable improvements and a number of initiatives, some of which the Deputy has mentioned. Some of these initiatives, including the construction safety partnership, are now up and running. Much preventative work and health and safety training is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The legislation is my priority and I hope to ensure it is completed by the end of the year.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_253">The legislation will introduce significant increases in penalties. No matter what legislation or regulation is employed, health and safety depends on people's own awareness. Unless and until we have a considerable improvement in preventative measures, awareness and training we will not see a reduction in the number of deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">My most devastating experience in politics is the weekly reading of the reports of workplace accidents. The circumstances surrounding each accident make very sad reading. Almost all of those accidents and most of those deaths could have been avoided had there been an awareness of safety.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_256">An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a personal injuries assessment board, PIAB. At the end of last month the Government mandated the setting up of the PIAB on an interim basis and legislation is being prepared to put the PIAB on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The various views put forward recently have dealt with the need to reform the court system and court procedures. I have no problem accepting that such reforms are needed. The key reforms advocated have already been recommended in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB. I would see the establishment of the PIAB and the introduction of court reforms not as alternative approaches but as going hand-in-hand and being mutually re-enforcing.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I would also see the interim PIAB examining in its early deliberation the various views put forward on the PIAB, and how it can maximise its effectiveness while avoiding the pitfalls highlighted.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_259">Political correctness dictates that I declare my interest. I am a lawyer, although  I have no personal interest in whether these proposals go ahead. Speaking as a public representative I voice my concern that the Government proposals to establish a personal injuries assessment board involve a leap in the dark. The proposals should be independently assessed before a final decision is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Does the Minister of State agree that while the proposals are supposed to lead to a reduction in the cost of personal injuries claims some experts now predict that they will lead to an increase in the cost of compensation and, accordingly, an increase in insurance premia? This will involve an expensive additional layer to the compensation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Does the Minister of State accept that the Government proposals should be put before a committee for independent scrutiny? This committee should be an all-party Oireachtas committee and the heavyweights of the interim board, the Law Society of Ireland, The Bar Council and the Irish Insurance Federation, should be asked to appear before the committee to justify and defend their positions in relation to the proposals. In this way we would hear the objective view of an Oireachtas committee on these proposals, which may or may not be a good idea. The onus of proof is on those who propose the establishment of this board.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">I say, with no disrespect to Deputy O'Keeffe, that the time has come for lawyers to recognise that it is time to put an end to the rip-off in the insurance industry and I am confident this problem will be tackled in an aggressive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">International experience points to the fact that a body such as the PIAB will have a significant and immediate effect on the cost of claims. As Deputy Hogan has said, the sooner it is put in place the better. That is the objective of the Minister and the Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_266">I have made a few bob in my time from compensation claims. I do not accept in any way that they were a rip-off, but that is not the point. We are talking about an issue of genuine public interest. Is the Minister aware that the Government's own PIAB implementation group, chaired by Mr. Cunneen, said that the establishment of this board would add another more expensive layer to the compensation system? Does he accept that there is need for independent scrutiny? Does he agree that, for example, the abortion hearings before the all-party committee introduced an element of transparency and that the report was very valuable? Does he agree that if the proposals are to be useful, they should be able to stand up to independent scrutiny, and that  the scrutiny should be provided by Members of this House? I am not going for a "Yea" or "Nay" in respect of these proposals. All I am saying is that the case is not proved.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I have seen simple solutions, one being to abolish juries which was to lead to a reduction in insurance costs. The abolition of the two senior counsel rule was another which was to lead to a reduction in insurance costs according to the Insurance Federation, but what happened? They just kept going. The problem is that we may be going up the same <i>cul de sac</i> here. We have had talk of a 31% reduction in insurance premia, but that is not correct. There is supposed to be no reduction in compensation, so from where is one going to get a 31% reduction in premia?</p>
          <p eId="para_268">My challenge to the Government is to have an independent assessment of these proposals by the Oireachtas. Is that not what we are here for?</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I want to take up the comments raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I was very cautious when he started because I felt his call for what I originally thought was an independent assessment by the Bar Council and the Law Society was something straight out of the old television programme "Yes Minister", in which it would have been killed with a thousand cuts of the pen by lawyers and barristers. The suggestion of an independent analysis, if Oireachtas Members can ever be independent, has merit. Will the Minister consider broadening the scope rather than just looking at the possibility of the PIAB as assessed here and take a radical look at alternative systems, such as the no-fault insurance system that operates in certain countries, including Australia and New Zealand? We should examine those as possible methods of dealing with this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The second revised suggestion from the Deputy is very much supported by our party. I am interested to hear if the Minister will take it on and broaden it so our independent analysis looks at a number of wide options and not just those already on the table.</p>

The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is making this proposal and is  about to set up an interim board on the basis that there will be a reduction in the cost of litigation and that the process of dealing with smaller claims will be much smoother. That is the reason she has stated the PIAB is to be established. I see nothing wrong with the jury being still out, if one will pardon the pun, about its effectiveness. The reason Deputies O'Keeffe, Eamon Ryan and others are seeking to have this matter fully investigated is so there will be confidence in the system when it is established and so it will achieve the objective of ultimately reducing the cost of insurance to consumers.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_287">Participation in the US-Ireland business summit was primarily focused on enhancing trade and investment, facilitating strategic business alliances between the United States and Ireland, and highlighting the very good progress being achieved on North-South co-operation. The summit, organised by Susan Davis International, was held in Washington from 4 to 6 September. The Government was one of a number of sponsors of the event, which was attended by senior business people and academics from the  United States and the island of Ireland. The summit was themed around three key areas of economic activity, namely, information and communications technology, biotechnology and financial services. Individual sessions addressed many of the important issues which are impacting on these sectors, such as market development and entry, research and development commercialisation, education and skills resourcing, intellectual property rights, competitiveness and corporate governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Tánaiste was accompanied at the summit by officials of the Department and also the chief executive officers of the enterprise development agencies. Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Don Evans, headed the US delegation and Sir Reg Empey, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, headed the Northern Ireland delegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">In her address to the summit, the Tánaiste spoke of the success of our economy, the strengths of the workforce and the challenge to reposition Ireland as a world class location for research and innovation. During the course of the summit she had meetings with US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mr. Tommy Thompson, and Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Evans. In her meeting with Secretary Evans she discussed US concerns on the implications of EU expansion on its bilateral investment treaties with the new EU accession countries, and issues surrounding the differing approaches of the EU and US to genetically modified organisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"><i>Additional information</i>The summit resulted in a number of important outcomes, which included the proposed establishment of a US-Ireland research partnership – an island-wide university-industry research partnership programme to further technology transfer, identify new avenues for collaboration and promote and foster world class capability for research and development in ways that are mutually beneficial; an invitation from the US National Science Foundation to Irish researchers to become associated with the development of the NSF high-performance network grid; an announcement by Secretary Thompson to lead a business mission to Ireland later this month; the development of co-operation between the US Council on Competitiveness, the National Competitiveness Council and the Northern Ireland Centre for Competitiveness; and an endorsement of the Digital Island concept currently being undertaken at the direction of the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The summit represented a unique occasion for Irish business to discuss new alliances, new trade and investment opportunities with other business leaders from the United States and Northern Ireland. I expect the contacts made will result in increased business and investment on the island of Ireland.</p>

Did she raise with the US Secretary of Commerce her concerns and those of IDA Ireland about the 3% fall in employment in the last annual report, arising from the drop in foreign direct investment? Did she explain the concerns many Irish people have in respect of the UNCTAD report, which showed our position in respect of foreign direct investment falling over the past year or two? Did she obtain any general views on what might be done to sustain direct investment in this country, especially in the midlands, the north-west and deprived areas of our cities, where there are now significant redundancies and job losses?</p>

Secretary Evans raised two substantive issues, both EU-related, namely GMOs and the US bilateral investment treaties with accession states. On the first item he stressed the need for political leadership in the EU to overcome consumer concerns. He wished to see circumstances in which judgment based on the latest, most-comprehensive scientific information could be used to address legitimate concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">On the second item, he stated that the US could not see why the Commission was insisting on BITs between the US and accession countries having to be negotiated. The Minister noted the concerns of Secretary Evans but she indicated that a consumer lobby in the European Union was raising legitimate concerns on the GMO question, which the Union considered needed to be addressed if there was to be a full buy-in. I will forward a reply on the other matter raised by the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">The report of the Redundancy Review Group was published by me on 22 October. I am pleased that the group, which included representatives of employers, workers and Departments, reached agreement on a wide range of policy and administrative issues. In particular, the group reached agreement on the treatment of older workers, insurability requirements, a ceiling on wages, qualification period, determination of weekly pay, non-reckonable service, employees working abroad, fines and penalties and the link between redundancy and training. Administrative issues that were agreed include the rounding of years of service, forms used in the administration of the scheme and the need for a new computer system.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The Government has agreed to proceed with the implementation of these changes. My Department will now prepare the necessary legislation to give effect to the policy changes. We will also plan for the introduction of a new IT system, which will include an e-government capability. This will greatly improve the efficiency and level of service offered by the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Certain items, including the level of the statutory redundancy ceiling, were not agreed by the Redundancy Review Group. However, the work of the group has clarified the costs involved in these items. As a result, the post-PPF negotiations, which have commenced recently, will benefit from the group's work in this regard and will be well informed regarding these costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">I thank the Minister of State for the detail regarding the review of the redundancy payments legislation which dates from 1967. Would he agree that a half a year's pay for each year of service plus a bonus week's pay is now insufficient for many workers when seeking to meet their obligations? There is much unease in the work place regarding the economic climate. In view of this, does the Minister of State consider that an early decision should be made on this issue? The net cost to employers would be insignificant if the terms were increased by up to one week. With the help of the social insurance fund, the additional cost of an additional two weeks would only cost employers an extra €26.6 million. In view of this, does the Minister of State agree that the impending budget presents an opportune time to make these necessary changes?</p>

          <p eId="para_306">The Omagh bombing was the single worst atrocity of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, leaving 31 innocent people dead, including unborn twins, and many more sustaining horrific injuries. The grief of the families has been exacerbated by the numerous and conflicting allegations about what was known about this attack by the authorities North and South of the Border. In recent weeks there have been further allegations and confusion. There has been a major television documentary on the issue and there was a major newspaper report last weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has confirmed that there was no formal ministerial contacts between his Government and the Real IRA, will he indicate if there was any informal contact, either with somebody nominated by him or by his then special adviser on Northern Ireland? Will he confirm that charges against seven men who were prime suspects in the Omagh bombing were brought about as a consequence of voluntary confessions? Will he indicate if these charges were subsequently dropped and, if so, why and on whose authority? Is he happy that the distinction in the division of powers legislation is as it should be?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_140">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_308">A number of suggestions and allegations concerning the Omagh bombing were made in a newspaper last weekend and in a recent television programme. I would like to address them all but it would take me some time to do so. At the outset I wish to address a vital point by again repeating that no deal was done by the Government with the Real IRA, either directly or indirectly, in return for a ceasefire. The allegation is as outrageous as it is deeply offensive. The evidence is entirely to the contrary. The ceasefire announcement on 7 September 1998 had nothing to do with anything on offer from the Government to the Real IRA because there was  nothing on offer, either then, before that time or at any subsequent time. No member of the Government made contact with the Real IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">However, I can confirm that some weeks before the Omagh bombing efforts were made by my then special adviser, Senator Mansergh, in his contacts with the 32 County Sovereignty Committee to persuade it to use its good offices to bring the Real IRA campaign to an end. Unfortunately, these efforts failed. It is important to stress that in the lead-up to the Real IRA ceasefire in September 1998, no initiative for contact was made by my special adviser. It was not the case that Senator Mansergh organised secret talks about a ceasefire. It is my understanding that Fr. Alex Reid, who had already been instrumental in helping to bring about two IRA ceasefires, received an approach after the Omagh bombing from some of those associated with the Real IRA campaign. At subsequent meetings he took the opportunity to impress on them the need to stop and he reported some observations to my special adviser and took advice from him. I am entirely satisfied that Fr. Reid in all his contact emphasised that, regardless of a ceasefire, the Omagh bombers would be pursued and the law would take its course in regard to all other crimes committed before a ceasefire. Any security consequences arising from the real IRA ceasefire would have been a matter exclusively for the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">There was no question at any time of instructing, or promising to instruct, the Garda to do other than conduct police operations as they judge right and appropriate in the circumstances facing them. In this connection, it is right to recognise that the Garda have done an outstanding job in pursuing those involved in real IRA activities. It is a matter of regret that two people who played a central role in brokering peace on this island, Senator Martin Mansergh and Fr. Alex Reid, should find themselves the subject of harmful innuendo concerning their role in the period following the Omagh outrage. They both acted at all times with commitment, honour and propriety in their efforts to contribute towards peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">In relation to the last part of Deputy Kenny's question about those who were subsequently released on an offence, I have the details and assure the Deputy that nothing untoward happened in that case. I understand these allegations are the source of examination by some named outside officials. I think I have a note on that and I will pass it on.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Can he confirm that the Garda crime and security section was aware of the theft of a black Mazda 626 in the early hours of 14 February 1998 for the purpose of carrying out a mortar attack? Can he also confirm that the Garda crime and security section was aware of the theft of a Fiat Punto in May 1998 on behalf of the Real IRA and that the thief was offered immunity in the event of being  caught? Can he further confirm that the Garda crime and security section was aware of the arrest of four English tourists in a white BMW in order to protect the credibility and integrity of a Garda informant?</p>
          <p eId="para_313">These are allegations that are causing confusion in the public mind. Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to issue a more comprehensive and complete detailed statement on these matters? Finally, can I ask the Taoiseach—</p>

I cannot put my hand on it now but it is part of the investigation. Most of the other points that were made in regard to the cars are all matters for the Garda and I cannot answer them because I do not have the details. I have details on many of the other issues and I will make a more detailed statement available on the points that have been made both in the TV programme and the news programme regarding the circumstances at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Both Senator Mansergh and Fr. Alex Reid were involved throughout the 1990s in contacts with the political wings and those representing various paramilitary groups. They spent much of their time talking to these groups who were on ceasefire and also with the 32 County Sovereignty Movement. They also dealt with people from the loyalist community. The inference is that they were involved in some untoward deal acting indirectly, but I want to make it clear to the House that they were at all times working towards doing something useful, as were others.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">Will the Taoiseach reveal if it is the Government's intention to amend the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal and to make some financial provision in line with the precedent in the haemophiliacs case for legal representation for the McBrearty family and others?</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I do not wish to comment in any way on the sensational and grave allegations regarding it that have confounded most law abiding citizens. Does the Taoiseach not agree that there is a compelling case to have expressly included in the terms of reference the former Minister for Justice, the Garda Commissioner, the State Solicitor in Donegal and arguably the former Attorney General?</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Is it not the case that Government spokespersons and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, last night on a television programme, have been seeking to give the impression that the terms of reference may only be amended if the sole member so requests? In fact, is it not the case that we passed a second item of legislation last year which again expressly provided for consultation between the Attorney General and the tribunal and that where the tribunal consents, amendments can be made to the terms of reference? Is it the intention of the Taoiseach to use that facility specifically designed for this kind of circumstance to make those other key personages amenable to the tribunal?</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Is it not correct that the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was put in possession of information going back more than three years by my colleague, Deputy Howlin and former Deputy, Jim Higgins? Is it not the case that no effective action was taken by the Minister and that may be why he was so anxious to flee the Department?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_324">Deputy Rabbitte has raised two issues, the first of which relates to the matter of costs. As I understand it, costs are at the discretion of the tribunal. The norm in tribunals is that this position is made at the end, but it is open to any party, as has been pointed out to the McBreartys, to make the case to the tribunal. If it is deemed necessary to change the terms of reference in that regard they can ask us to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">It is correct to say that the terms of reference were decided by the House based on the recommendations of a senior counsel who advised us on it. The tribunal said that it would consider arguments or submissions for the extension of the terms of reference. There is provision in the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts for an extension of the terms of reference upon request by a tribunal. In this case the terms of reference have been raised by Mr. McBrearty with the tribunal, which has indicated it is open to considering it. In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for Government to pre-empt the tribunal at the request of one individual, so I do not have any proposal at this stage to change it.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Anyone whom the tribunal wishes to bring forward, as in all the tribunals governed by legislation, can be asked to appear. Just because one is not listed in the terms of reference does not mean one is precluded from it. If Mr. Justice Morris believes he does not have that power it is open to him to ask us to do it. My advice is that there is not a difficulty with either issue at this  stage. If a difficulty arises, Mr. Justice Morris will ask for his terms of reference to be amended and the House will do so.</p>

Does the Taoiseach understand the issues involved? I do not want to repeat the gravity or scope of the allegations, but if the McBrearty family does not have the financial wherewithal to be legally represented, why can the same arrangement not be made that was made in the case of haemophiliacs?</p>
          <p eId="para_328">How can the Taoiseach say he has no intention to amend the terms of reference having regard to what has come into the public domain and given that it is anticipated more information and allegations will come into the public domain? How can he exclude the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who voted down in this House a joint motion tabled by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the Green Party on 21 November last year, thus preventing a tribunal of inquiry?</p>

          <p eId="para_332">I also do not want to comment about the seriousness or gravity of the issues before the Morris tribunal. I reiterate our position, about which Deputy Rabbitte asked. Under the Acts the awarding of costs is a matter for the tribunal, not for the Minister. The Acts provide that persons can be awarded or denied their costs or, in certain circumstances, be required to pay the costs of the tribunals. These legal provisions are regarded as of major significance to the tribunal's capacity to function effectively and secure full co-operation from the relevant parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">This was put in a different formulation in an Act passed in 1998. It would be almost impossible to distinguish between different witnesses and interested parties in making a decision to pay their costs in advance. In these circumstances it is not possible to select one potential witness or interested party for special treatment in regard to the costs issue. However, I have no doubt that McBrearty family members want to fully co-operate with the tribunal and that, therefore, they should seek that their costs be paid. I checked  this issue earlier and it is only in extraordinary cases of non-co-operation that tribunals do not pay costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">The Deputy is concerned that the number of CE scheme places will be cut by 13,000 because of something that he read and I told him not to be concerned. I mentioned an agreed year end figure of 25,000 places for last year. His concern that 13,000 people will be displaced and unemployed is not the position. The position is as I have outlined, with the year end figure at 25,000. Those who need to find another course, about whom the Deputy wants me to respond, are not being displaced. I cannot respond, therefore, about people who are not being displaced.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_351">Paddy Hegarty was a man who came to politics, not for what he could get out of it, but rather for what he could do for the families of east Cork and, by extension, the people of his native county and country. As a farmer from Cloyne who was completely unpretentious, he took the business of Fine Gael and this House seriously. He took himself lightly which stood him in fine stead with party and parliamentary colleagues on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Paddy Hegarty was first elected to Dáil Éireann for the then constituency of Cork North-East, now Cork East, in 1973 and served the people and the House until 1989 with passion, dignity, pride and humour. In keeping with the ethos of Fine Gael, he always put the national interest over private or party interest and, as Minister of State at the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce, was diligent and committed to his responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Paddy Hegarty was passionate about politics which, coming from east Cork, made him equally passionate about the land, farming and farming folk. He believed utterly in the connection of the people with the land and, in turn, in the land's  innate ability to repair and restore. To walk his own land was one of his enduring pleasures. It simply made sense to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Paddy Hegarty's funeral last Sunday was one of celebration. People came from all over the country to pay their respects to a fine public servant, kind neighbour and good friend. His funeral was a celebration. Humour was endemic in all his activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">For newer Members, he could give an abject lesson in authority and the use of power. In 1976 he made a stirring address to the Ballymacoda Fine Gael branch. He opened the meeting with a ten minute speech. The week afterwards he said to me he was up against Dick Barry who had been elected in 1954. After his stirring address, the veteran, Dick Barry, addressed the meeting by saying that when he was leaving Leinster House a hand had caught him by the arm. It was the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave. He said he wanted to send a special message to the people of Ballymacoda. Paddy Hegarty said he could not do anything except to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">He truly excelled as a father and as a husband. He will be a great loss to his wife, Eileen, and to his five sons and two daughters. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis. An fhad agus a bhí sé anseo, d'oibrigh sé go dian ar son mhuintir Chorcaigh agus is dócha go ndearnadh sé a dhícheall an t-am ar fad anseo agus ina chondae dúchais.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and on my behalf, I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and to the Fine Gael Party on the death of Paddy Hegarty last Thursday. I remember him as a Member of the House. He was an active, decent and committed person, as Deputy Kenny said. He was a nice person to meet and to talk to. I recall him as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture. I extend my sympathy and that of my colleagues to his wife, Eileen, his daughters, Kathleen and Eileen, his sons, Peadair, Niall, Philip, Richard and Padraig, his two religious sisters and his brother, Dick.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">He was born and educated in Cork. He worked through the political system in east Cork. He was a founder member and director of Cork Foods and vice-chairman of the Beet Growers Association. I recall him being deeply involved in farming activities. Like many Members on my side of the House, he was involved in Macra na Feirme. He was also a member of the Irish Farmers' Association. I recall in the early days of the social partnership process he made many comments about the farming lobby. He also raised that issue in the House. He was elected for Cork East in 1973 and served until 1989. He gave good service to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Paddy was also a member of Cork County Council for many years before that. As Fine Gael spokesman for agriculture and tourism and as Minister of State with special responsibility for agricultural production, he served his constituents, his party and the people of the country well.  He was also in the Department of Industry and Commerce during the 1986-87 period. He served in a number of Departments as a result of his expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I join with Deputy Kenny and Members of the House in extending our sympathy to his wife, Eileen, and to his sons and daughters. I extend the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Party to his family for the excellent service he gave in both east Cork and nationally. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

I only had a brief acquaintance with him as a Member of the House between 1987 and 1989. He showed me kindness and courtesy on every occasion, although he had more experience than I had as he was closing a 16 year period of service to the State. We should not forget that in addition to all the service to his own locality, he served as the chairman of the Council of Europe's fisheries committee from 1979 to 1982. He served democracy not merely on this island but on the Continent. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend our sympathy to his wife, his sons and daughters and to the Fine Gael Party.

Many of us in the House may have known of him, but we did not serve with him. He is remembered as someone who served as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture between 1982 and 1987. He was part of the considerable work which was done at that time and which still needs to be done in terms of representing the interests of Irish agriculture. I hope his memory and the energy he brought to his work will be an inspiration to those who must grapple with the difficulties and severe problems in agriculture at present.

He was someone with whom one could deal because any arrangement would be honoured. He was not only involved in political life but in the social life of east Cork. He was involved in Macra na Feirme and he also took part in plays. He was involved in the development of other facilities when he left public life. Paddy was wholeheartedly involved in the public life of east Cork for all his life. He will be missed by all those who knew him and particularly by his family. I extend my sympathy to his family.

          <p eId="para_368">Paddy was a farmer in east Cork. He spent all his life in farming and in politics. He was a member of Macra na Feirme, as the Taoiseach said, and also of the IFA. He represented farmers in dark days when things were difficult in agriculture. He was influential in that area. He inherited the seat from the late Fianna Fáil Deputy, Martin Corry. He had big shoes to fill when he represented Martin Corry, but he did that with affection, dignity and efficiency. He had a passion for agriculture and for the food industry. He made many efforts to industrialise east Cork in terms of the food industry, particularly regarding Erin Foods. He had a great friendship with Dr. Tony O'Reilly who was the managing director and president of the Heinz Corporation. He made strenuous efforts to bring that company to east Cork through his contacts with Dr. O'Reilly. However, when it was located in Dundalk, it caused him great disappointment. Having done a great deal of donkey work, he was very sad the company located elsewhere. Nonetheless, what one part of the island lost, the other gained.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Paddy held strong Christian values and views and was never afraid to speak his mind on social legislation. He died with his passion and views  intact. May the green soil of his native Cloyne lie lightly on his breast. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">I first got to know Paddy Hegarty when I joined Fine Gael back in the 1970s. He was a big man, both in stature and spirit. As Deputy Ned O'Keeffe said, his religious values were important to him. He was conscious of his humanity and often prayed. He was a modest man who, on becoming ill last summer, did not want any fuss or visits. He wanted to meet his maker with dignity which he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Paddy was an expert farmer who was interested in horticulture and innovation. He helped establish the vegetable plant in Midleton and tried to implement other plans. He left political life under something of a cloud because of a controversy surrounding the Merrill Dow company. He believed passionately in setting up a factory in east Cork, an idea with which, fortunately or unfortunately, many people did not agree at the time. He was not one to shy away from controversy and fought for what he believed in. I extend my sympathy to his wife, Eileen, to his family and to his brother and sisters. May Paddy Hegarty, a big man in spirit and body, rest in peace.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">We object to No. 15 being hived off to a committee given that it is a vital matter which should be dealt with in the House. We understood that there would be statements on Northern Ireland, particularly as this item deals with policing, and that statements were to address the subversion of policing implied by reports of the Government's secret deal with the Real IRA. Given that the issue of policing is vital in terms of the peace process, I ask the Ceann Comhairle to accept that this matter should be dealt with in the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_400">We on the Sinn Féin team cannot agree with the proposal to refer the motion on the policing agreement between the Irish and British Governments to committee without debate. This is one of the crucial issues facing the country and it is central to the peace process. We want to see a new beginning to policing as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and we want to see the Patten proposals implemented in full. There needs to be all-Ireland co-operation as the basis for future policing on this island, but it must be in the context of a new police service in the North, which we do not have yet. We would support the measures in the agreement on policing if the Patten proposals were already in place north of the Border, but they are not. It is unacceptable for this motion to be passed along to by-pass the opportunity for debate in this Chamber and, accordingly, I record an objection to that formula.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_515">I move the following Supplementary Estimate:</p>
          <p eId="para_516">That a supplementary sum not exceeding €12,489,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2002, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including certain services administered by that Office, for the payment of certain subsidies and grants and for the payment of certain grants under cash-limited schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">In the absence of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is away on official business, I would like to propose that the Dáil approves the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the amount of €12.489 million. I thank the Whips for arranging Dáil time for the taking of this motion at short notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">This Supplementary Estimate is needed to provide Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta with the funds which the two shareholders in Irish Fertilizer Industries, ICI and the State, acting through NET, have agreed to provide for <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments to IFI workers. We would wish to be able to make payments as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The Government and ICI believe that an orderly wind-down and liquidation is in everybody's interests and in an effort to support such an outcome we have agreed, even though there is no legal obligation to do so, to provide a sum of nearly €24.5 million to cover <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payments to the workers. The State is providing €12.489 million or 51% of the fund, reflecting its shareholding in IFI and this is the amount for which Dáil approval is being sought today. ICI will be providing €12 million based on its 49% shareholding.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">When combined with statutory entitlements, which will be payable by the liquidator, a total of nearly €32 million will be available for redundancy, which would be sufficient to provide average payments of over €50,000 per worker – a sum which is considered fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The exact terms for the distribution of these funds will be determined following discussions between the workers' representatives and Mr. Ray Jackson, who is being appointed as sole trustee of the trust being used for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">In addition to creating a significant fund for severance payments for IFI's workers, the State and ICI have responded positively to a particular  difficulty highlighted by the unions. Specifically, the unions have pointed out that workers laid off in recent days face the prospect of severe cashflow difficulties within a short period because the company was, unfortunately, only in a position to pay wages due up to the date of lay off. In addition, it has emerged that it is likely to take a number of weeks before statutory entitlements can be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">In this context, the Government and ICI have agreed to provide funds immediately, which will enable payments on account to be made. These interim payments will be based on the lower of €5,000 or three months pay. Most workers would then qualify for additional payments once the basis for the allocation of the funds available has been determined following discussions between the unions and the trustee, Mr. Jackson. However, the State cannot allocate any funding for this purpose without a Supplementary Estimate. Accordingly, it is imperative that the Dáil approve this Estimate as a matter of urgency in order that we can start making payments to the workers as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">It is very much regretted that, despite the tremendous efforts made by IFI's board, management and workforce, the company could not survive. The board of IFI decided on 15 October last that the company would have to cease trading and that a liquidator should be appointed. It felt that it had no other option in the light of the financial position in which it found itself, particularly when the two shareholders in the company had indicated that they were not in a position to continue supporting the company in the absence of a realistic viability plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The shareholders had for some time made it clear to the board that such a viability plan would be a prerequisite for any further financial injections to the company on top of the considerable support provided during the years. Unfortunately, the company was not able to produce such a plan and instead sought funding of €10 million to enable it to continue trading in the short-term. Even then, the board accepted that the level of funding sought might prove inadequate. The shareholders were concerned that even relatively small setbacks to the plan in the short-term would inevitably result in further requests for support.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Following the board's decision, the wind-down of the business has been taking place. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the professionalism of the workforce which has been actively engaged in the decommissioning of the company's plants in a responsible, safe and orderly manner. It is to be admired and congratulated for this responsible attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The board of IFI has called a creditors meeting for Friday next, 8 November, in the Pavilion, Leopardstown, at which it is expected that a liquidator will be appointed. The liquidator will seek to realise the assets of the company in an efficient and effective manner with a view to satisfying the debts of the company to the maximum extent. The board will also present a statement of affairs  at the creditors meeting. This will give an estimate of the prospects for the payment of all creditors, including the shareholders, who had extended loans of €34 million to the company. It should be noted, however, that the actual position can only be determined with certainty when the assets of the company are realised. Both shareholders have agreed in principle to subordinate their loans to the company in favour of the other creditors.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">With regard to pensions, the initial indications suggest there are serious difficulties with the scheme covering the Belfast workers. The position of the schemes covering the other workers remains unclear at this stage and it seems likely that it will take some time before the trustees of the funds can establish the full facts. Nevertheless, the position with these schemes may be somewhat better, although there may still be some problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">It is obviously a matter of extreme concern that employees' pension entitlements may not be capable of being met by their pension funds. However, I understand the company has been meeting its obligations to the various schemes and that the difficulties stem mainly from adverse stock market movements rather than from any default on the part of the company. The recent stock market developments would have had a significant adverse impact on virtually all pension funds, although the level of this impact would obviously vary from fund to fund depending on the investment strategy followed in each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Pension issues are complicated and, clearly, the trustees of the various schemes will have to establish the full facts for each of the schemes and consider the range of options available to them to minimise the shortfalls that may be involved. Presumably, they will seek to maximise any possible recoveries from the liquidator or other parties. It seems likely that it will take some time for the various issues involved to be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In addition to the initiatives which the Government has taken in conjunction with ICI to provide financial assistance for the workers, the Government has been active in seeking to help the workforce find alternative employment. In this regard, the Tánaiste has ensured Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the IDA have adopted a co-ordinated approach in response to the closure of the major IFI plants in Cork and Arklow. The approach is directed at assisting all employees affected by the closure and already under way. The co-ordinated approach has two objectives: first, to enhance and facilitate the future employment prospects of the IFI workforce and, second, to identify and support any individual who wishes to start their own business.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">The Tánaiste has also been in contact with her counterpart in Northern Ireland in  this regard. This programme of involvement is being delivered in Cork and Arklow by the regionally based staff of the agencies and co-ordinated by a selected senior executive in each agency. These supportive efforts have been agreed with the management of IFI, which is facilitating the process at both plants. Specific actions, both planned and under way, are as follows.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Enterprise Ireland has written to its client companies in the areas of Wicklow-south County Dublin and east Cork-Cork city advising them of the pool of labour that will become available shortly from the IFI closure. The letter outlines the range of skills involved and a contact point. FÁS held briefing sessions with management and trade union representatives on Wednesday, 30 October, in Cork, Arklow and Sandyford, the location of the company's headquarters, to give an overview of FÁS involvement with IFI employees in advising on future career development. These sessions included inputs from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Starting this week, FÁS will register all IFI employees and give initial guidance interviews on career planning. On 13 November, the registration and interview process will be assessed and training and retraining requirements agreed with FÁS and IFI representatives. The IDA will liaise with FÁS on training course content to match the needs of recently announced start-ups and expansions of IDA companies in the affected areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">"Start your own Business" seminars for IFI employees are also scheduled for this week in Arklow and Cork. These seminars are being conducted by Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise board executives and assisted by an experienced business mentor. Follow on, one to one meetings will be held where required and the full range of Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise board support will be available to all IFI employees wishing to start their own business.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">This initial phase of the programme will give rise to an ongoing series of activities involving training-retraining of employees, individual counselling sessions and exploring potential new business ideas. FÁS will maintain the register of employees and track the outcome of the agencies' efforts on an individual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">While it is regrettable that the jobs in IFI could not be saved, the Government, in conjunction with ICI, has, even though there is no obligation to do so, agreed to provide a significant amount of money to fund <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments which are considered fair and reasonable. Steps are also being taken to mobilise the State's training and industrial development agencies in order to provide as much support as possible for IFI workers in their efforts to find alternative employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The proposal before the House will enable much needed interim payments on account to be made, pending finalisation of the arrangements for the distribution of the funds available for <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments. This should go a long way in alleviating any hardship that might otherwise arise from the incapacity of the company to pay statutory entitlements at this time. I ask the House to approve the Supplementary Estimate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_541">The Fine Gael Party will support the Supplementary Estimate before the House. It is now becoming apparent that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, mismanaged the IFI company and the manner in which she announced the closure. She could be accused of total mismanagement or reckless trading under the Companies Acts. I base this assertion on the following points and questions which need to be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">IFI was returning a profit in September 2001 of £15 million but losing £35 million a year later. All the financial losses were incurred by January 2002. The accounts of the company reflect this. Was the Tánaiste aware of the financial re-forecast presented to the company last January which showed these losses for the year? The financial situation of the company began to deteriorate quickly in January and February 2002. Was the board of IFI and the shareholders aware of this financial situation and its deterioration? If the Tánaiste, as the major shareholder in the company, had this information ten months ago, she could have sought to implement a viability plan at that stage or made the decision to conduct an orderly shut-down of the company. Instead, that decision was made, with a day's notice to the workers and the company, some weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">By not taking action earlier this year, the Tánaiste and the board are responsible for the manner in which the company has been closed down, the way the announcement was made and the manner in which the creditors and workers were left in shock following the decision made by the Government and the Tánaiste. This was reckless. The losers are the 700 employees and the local economies of Cobh, Arklow and Belfast. I am told that Mr. Keogh, a pension adviser with AON, stated at a public meeting in IFI that the pension fund decreased by 20% in 2001 and by a further 20% since February 2002. The pension fund comprised a mixture of investment and stocks. If the company was deteriorating in January or February this year surely the pension contributions, which are there for the benefit of workers, could have been put into a more risk-free environment, such as cash and bonds, to eliminate the risk of further losses, particularly since February 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Under company law the board of IFI has a duty of care to the stakeholder group, such as creditors, employees and shareholders. I contend that the board did not exercise that duty because no statutory notice was given, no statutory redun dancy was offered, holiday pay due was not considered, workers' pensions were put at risk and creditors, including hauliers, were left hanging in the wind due to this precipitous decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Even if we approve the motion for this Supplementary Estimate it will be some time before payments can be made. I hope the Government will make them as quickly as possible, otherwise many small creditors will go out of business. The Government should ensure that early payments are made and that no further unemployment will arise from this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Will the Minister explain how, even though the financial position of the company was deteriorating last January and February, some €4 million or €5 million in capital investment was made at the time? This decision generated more creditors, yet brought no benefit to the company or its employees. The workers have been treated shabbily and the opportunity to make parts of the company viable was not considered properly. The case against the Minister for the manner she has handled this matter is damning.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_547">If this was a private concern we would be seeking an examination of the company because what has occurred verges on criminal negligence. People who worked for 25 years in this company, some of whom are in their 60s and expected to retire shortly, now find that they will receive only 60% of their expected pension. It is incredible that such a situation was allowed to develop in a company, 51% of which was owned by the Government. I am seeking a full statement explaining how the pension rights of these workers – many of whom gave most of their lives to the company – have been eroded. Why have these people been left high and dry? All the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment can say is, "Start your own businesses". How would people react, however, if I returned to Cork and advised a 62 year old IFI employee to start his or her own business in a time of recession? It is callous and cold-hearted to suggest such a course of action, particularly as pensions will fall short of expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Despite the fact that the Government has so many representatives in Cork city and county, it allowed this company to go down the tubes and the workers have been hung out to dry. It is despicable. It is another hammer blow for the traditional industries in Cork harbour, which have all but disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Government allowed IFI to collapse, leaving the workers high and dry, as well as many business creditors who will now go out of business. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should provide a thorough explanation to the House on how the IFI pension fund became so seriously under-funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In the time remaining to me, I wish to hand over to Deputy Timmins whose constituency has been affected as much as the Cork region.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_551">I thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for meeting a deputation from County Wicklow in her Department last Friday. The Minister's speech reads well and some of the things he pointed out sounded nice, but the reality is somewhat different. A short time ago, I spoke to an employee of IFI who had just over 30 years' service in the Arklow plant. He said he and his colleagues had first heard the rumour of closure from <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper. A few weeks later he was told not to come in on Friday because he was finished. When he went home on Friday he received a letter in the post notifying him of the plant's closure. If this happened in a multinational company with a boardroom in Denver, we would be banging the table and saying this is a terrible way to treat people. This happened in a company of which the Government is the main shareholder, yet the Government is trying to pretend it had nothing to do with it. We have heard much about the liquidator and the board of directors, but nothing about the majority shareholder which is the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">This Government is an uncaring one that has treated the IFI workers with disdain. The deal the workers are getting is inferior to that enjoyed by workers who left in the past when IFI was being restructured. It is a terrible way to treat people and it sends out a poor signal. It also puts the Government on a poor footing if it wishes to take action against a private company operating in a similar manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Although I have tried to tease out the matter, I have not received a satisfactory answer as to why a viability plan for the Arklow IFI plant was not received by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Minister of State should examine this matter. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said she did not receive such a plan, yet the Government should have explored every avenue. What role does the Government-appointed inspector have in respect of producing a viability plan for the Arklow plant? An all-or-nothing effort appears to have been made, while areas of IFI that could have been saved were sacrificed to save someone's political hide.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Although it is regrettable that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not present, it is pertinent that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is here. Has he indicated any concern regarding the price of future agricultural inputs because there may be a long-term negative impact on the area?</p>

          <p eId="para_557">The Government is a majority shareholder in IFI, yet the way it addressed the company's insolvency was nothing short of shameful. In the short time available, I wish to deal with the specific issue of the Supplementary Estimate before us. The Labour Party will not be opposing the Supplementary Estimate because it is important that moneys be made available to Mr. Jackson to distribute it as quickly as possible to people who are being thrown out of work, many of them following decades of employment in IFI. Those who negotiated on behalf of the workers understood a substantial payment would be made available. On 17 October, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated publicly that Cabinet approval would be sought for a fair and reasonable redundancy package for IFI workers. It is my understanding, however, that no agreement has yet been reached on the scale and scope of such a package. The workers expected an interim package to come before this House which – as the Minister for Agriculture and Food said in his statement – would allow for immediate hardship cases to be addressed by a down payment on the package that was to be finalised by agreement with the unions. Given the Minister's speech and the precise sum in the Supplementary Estimate, however, it seems the Government has determined that €12.5 million, together with the statutory payments – a total of €32 million – is the full extent of the severance and redundancy package. I wish the Minister to make it abundantly clear if this is the Government's intent. Is this the final word? It certainly will come as a shock to those who believe that they are still in negotiations on the final package. They will be shocked to find that the Government has arbitrarily decided that it will fix the sum and this is the limit of the supports which are to be available. The Government, as the majority shareholder, has a unique responsibility in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Let me deal briefly with the urgent issue of pensions. It was compulsory for the employees to join the company pension scheme and they paid 7.5% of their gross pay to the scheme. They were told year in, year out that there was a defined benefit scheme, that the money was there to pay a defined benefit and that everything was in order. It was not until ten days after the announcement of the company's liquidation that pensioners discovered that the employees' pension fund would be liquidated at the same time as the company and it is only now that they are discovering that the pension entitlements, which they thought were in good standing and which they were assured over the years were in good standing, may well not be in good standing at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">One would get no succour whatsoever from the comments of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who stated in his speech:</p>
          <p eId="para_560">With regard to pensions, the initial indications suggest there are serious difficulties with the scheme covering the Belfast workers. The  position of the schemes covering the other workers remains unclear at this stage and it seems likely that it will take some time before the trustees of the funds can establish the full facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">What we want is not an investigation of the full facts but an undertaking from the Government that it will uphold its own responsibilities and ensure that a decent input of resources from the State to the pension fund will be made available to ensure that those people, who paid in good faith into a staff pension fund, will receive the benefit to which they believed and were constantly assured they would be entitled to. Has the Government said that it will not augment the pension fund unless there is a <i>pro rata</i> contribution from ICI in accordance with its 49% stake? We need to know where the Government stands on the severance package and the pension scheme and that is the clarity that I am demanding from the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I wish to mention two other brief points. First, I wish to mention the devastation that this closure has caused. I represent the constituency of Wexford and north Wexford is greatly affected by the Arklow closure. My colleague, Deputy McManus, will deal with that in more detail, but the impact cannot be over stressed by us in the House. Arklow and north Wexford are already areas of severe unemployment and this is a body blow, and I know the situation in Belfast and Cork is no different.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">This closure is also having a serious impact on the rail service. IFI was one of the most important freight customers of Iarnród Éireann and it is now being used as a justification for the downgrading and closure of some of the routes and the abandoning of much of the rail freight service. Those of us from the south-east who met with the Minister for Transport earlier today have an assurance that no decisions will be made by the board of CIE tomorrow regarding freight or any rail closures. Unfortunately my fear is that this is simply a delaying tactic until such time as the strategic report is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The knock-on effects of this closure are very serious for the south-east region as a whole, for Cork and for Belfast. Those issues must be debated in some detail in this House, but what we need as a minimum from the Government to deal in any fair or proper way with the hundreds of workers who are shocked by losing their jobs in the IFI debacle is clear assurances on where it stands regarding severance payments and their pension rights.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_565">Last Friday a small group of public representatives from County Wicklow met with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. The chairman of Wicklow County Council, who came with us on that deputation, has lost his job as a result of this closure and the Mayor of Arklow town council has been affected directly as he is a service pro vider for that plant. That is an indication of just how dependent the town of Arklow has been on this particular plant. It was a very disappointing meeting. It was clear from the Minister's attitude, and the way that she indicated that the Government was closing down possibilities rather than opening them up, that this was a political decision made with ideological intent to get rid of a State enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The effect of the decision is to end the livelihoods of up to 400 people in Arklow and north Wexford. It has a devastating impact and it is only beginning to permeate the local community. As we were meeting the Minister, almost 100 people were leaving their jobs for the last time – between Thursday and Friday – with nothing more than the weekly wage in their pockets because of the circumstances and the lack of preparation for which the Government is responsible. It is only because of the good offices of the community welfare officer, who used his own discretion, that these people were treated with some dignity and respect. There has been a strong protest from the workers who came from Belfast, Cork and Wicklow and protested outside the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the redundancy arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">It needs to be pointed out that when redundancy arrangements were made in the past, for example, in the Arklow plant, the deal that people got was a good one. It meant, however, that the people who were left behind had to take on additional responsibilities and duties. Those people who stayed on and committed themselves to the enterprise are now losing out and are getting a worse deal than their colleagues who left at an earlier date. That is unacceptable and it is simply wrong, particularly when the Minister indicated that she was committed to giving them a fair deal. If she means it, then the Government and ICI will have to come up with more money to put into the pool of money left for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Nobody expected the issue of pension rights to become such a central issue. It is quite extraordinary and disturbing that workers should be so vulnerable having contributed towards their pension funds. The Government has got to deal with this issue to ensure that people's rights are protected and not simply prevent it being addressed directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">In concluding his contribution on behalf of the Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, tried to make the case that while the Government has no legal obligation to provide <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments, it should be acknowledged and rewarded for doing so. However, the Government, as a majority shareholder in IFI, has a responsibility  to make sure that the workers involved in these plants are given statutory notice and the necessary documentation in terms of P45 forms and RP1 forms, and the scandalous behaviour of the company, on behalf of the majority shareholder, is significantly at issue in the provision of these funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has let herself down and has not fulfilled her responsibilities properly, not only as custodian on behalf of the people of the shareholding in IFI but as the member of the Government who is responsibility for making sure that employment legislation is not only put on the Statute Book, but implemented equally and fairly throughout the public and private sectors. She has let herself and the Government down to such an extent that I would argue that this should be a resigning matter, but it will not be.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The €12.48 million being approved by the House will not be opposed by the Green Party, but we oppose this being the only payment the Government intends to put forward. It is failing to live up to its responsibilities to the IFI workers. Not only is the €12.48 million not enough, it is only half enough. The workers have asked for payments of at least five and a half weeks wages per year of service. The proposed payment does not meet the likely shortfall in the pension fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Neither the Government nor the company has put forward a plan to deal with the safety risk arising from having a skeleton workforce at each of the plants involved. At Marino Point this weekend four people were on hand to supervise the 26,000 tonnes of ammonia in the two tanks. There are two compressors on each tank, one of those four compressors was faulty and the fail-safe for that compressor was a flare valve which was itself faulty. Any Estimate the Government puts before this House must not only take account of the redundancy and of the pension scheme entitlements of the workers but it must also take account of the environmental custodianship which has been maintained by a workforce which is skilled and committed despite years of under investment in the plant and machinery in the plants concerned. Neither the Government nor the Minister should be allowed to get away with this type of negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The Minister has failed to acknowledge that the average age of the Marino Plant workers is between the middle and late forties. I am sure the ages of the Arklow and Belfast workers are similar. These people are coming to the end of their working lives and the alternative supports from FÁS and county enterprise boards which are being offered are insulting to the people concerned. The Government has failed to acknowledge that a decision was probably made nine months ago to close this business but the closure was postponed for political considerations connected with the general election of last June.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">For these reasons, for playing loose and fast with people's livelihoods, for failing to put in place back-up plans to protect the legal entitlements of the workers and the environment of the areas concerned we should be debating, not a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but a motion of confidence in the Department and its Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_577">It was stated earlier that this House is not a crèche but some Ministers clearly think it is. The Government is telling IFI workers that Enterprise Ireland will help them to start their own businesses. Doing what, I ask? It will not be making fertiliser.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">This token Supplementary Estimate is a sleight of hand and yet another example of bad faith, broken promises and bad practice by the Government, which should be setting the best possible standards as an employer. The workers who met the Taoiseach last Friday night left that meeting believing that today's Estimate was an interim and not a final payment. Yet, today we find the Taoiseach's promise of last Friday does not hold in the cold light of day.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">This is but the last in a series of blows inflicted on IFI workers. Why were the workers in the Cork plant summarily dismissed with one hour's notice, their lunches left uneaten? Why are they not being paid severance pay? Why was no statutory notice given? Even worse is the state of the workers' pension fund, which has been shown to have a 40% shortfall. Has this fund been put in the care of the liquidator and if so, why? This Supplementary Estimate clearly does not deal with the pension shortfall. Given that it is the 51% shareholder, how does the Government propose to deal with this problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_580">This week IFI workers are travelling to ICI headquarters in Britain, paying for their own flights, to negotiate with the other shareholder in the company. The workers have intimated that the Government has told them it will match any payment secured from ICI, which made profits of £569 million last year. Surely an Irish Government should take a more fair and honest stance and fulfil its responsibility as an employer? What example is the Government setting for the private sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_581">In the context of the island economy where we need to show a just and prudent record as an employer, what example are we setting for Northern workers, who are also redundant and facing diminished pensions?</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The Department's website has a new feature of an on-line redundancy calculator. One wonders how it calculates redundancy payments. If it is based on the recent track record of the Department the results would be very interesting and I hope the Minister for Finance was not responsible for formulating the calculator's programme.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_583">One would not wish to delay the setting aside of funds for immediate disbursement to workers in IFI in this unfortunate and  disgraceful situation. However, the arrangement being proposed here is an insult to the 620 workers being summarily dismissed.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The €25 million being set aside for the workers' redundancy packages contrasts in the most scandalous fashion with an incredible €238 million paid by IFI's parent company, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, in interest alone to banks between 1987 and 1999, on debts taken over in 1987 from IFI. Four or five banks have soaked this State owned company to the tune of €238 million in interest, not counting a single euro of principal, yet all we have left for workers is €12.4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The political establishment is covering up this scandal. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment refused to answer my questions on this scandal two weeks ago and no one from Fianna Fáil will dare comment on why banks were allowed to rob the semi-State sector blind in this fashion. We now see workers being left with the crumbs of a few million euro. The media has not featured this scandal in the way it should. The truth about this Government is coming out with greater ferocity every day. It is a Government of deadly hostility to publicly owned industry. IFI could have been saved with imagination and proper investment and by diversity into natural fertilisers and composting. New and diverse products could have maintained this industry in public ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">This morning we heard that Iarnród Éireann, under the auspices of the Government, is preparing to let go 330 workers because it wishes to privatise sectors of its freight business. Redundancy payments are no recompense to workers and are, in general, entirely inadequate. Workers in the Irish Glass Bottle Company and Peerless Rugs brought this matter to public attention. The Wexford Electronic workers, after a lifetime of service, were left with the insult of half a week's wages per year of service. This is an outrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Those of us who have just heard in detail from the Minister about the uncertainty of the pension rights of IFI workers are absolutely staggered. It is incredible that workers in a company which is half in State ownership do not know their pension rights. This is unbelievable and a matter for which the Government must answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It is time for the leadership of the trade union movement to get out of the parlour with the Government and employers and give real leadership in the fight on these issues to get workers' rights and a different programme which will save companies in public ownership and ensure real levels of redundancy payments for workers if they are let go.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">With the permission of the House I will share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The situation in IFI has been well known for many years to anyone who looked at the financial background to that company. If we wish to be  truthful to ourselves and the workers we must accept that this is a highly cyclical industry which has had a number of extremely bad years. It is also true that, over the years, various Administrations of various political hues put significant funds into IFI and its predecessor, NET.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Much of the debate that has taken place in the House involved understandable political point scoring. Nevertheless, the reality has to be faced by Members. It is not true, as has already been suggested, that the situation was masked in the general election. In fact, it was in July, after the election, that the first rumblings of the current circumstances were heard.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">The Deputy will have his moment. The reality is that a valiant effort has been made for months to get a strategic alliance with this particular company. The one player in the field, the Finnish company, pulled out, as everybody knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The case in which I am most parochially interested is that of the Arklow plant. I believe the Arklow plant has been pulled down by another plant, which is obviously operating under different economic circumstances. However, my major concerns are threefold. First, I hope the liquidator, going forward, will make a real effort to see if the Arklow plant can, with a minimal investment, be made viable again. It should be kept up and running. I have already discussed this with officials. If the liquidator seeks, rather than to simply sell off the plant in a fire-sale, to look for some sort of strategic alliance, something could be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I am concerned about the points being made in the House about the pension fund, not least because my constituents will be deeply worried by some of those allegations. Members know what the situation is with regard to a pension fund. A pension fund is in the control of the trustees. As it happens, the trustees of the pension fund in the Republic have done a very good job. There are two separate pension funds in the Republic, one of which is well insulated. The other, which is over-subscribed, has a problem because the equities, which are part of that fund, will have to be sold or turned into annuities, as Members who wish to be truthful will know.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_606">The trustees have operated prudentially. Deputy Howlin knows that the equities, which are now at a low ebb, will have to be converted into annuities.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">There are a couple of possible points I want to raise, one of which I have already raised with the Minister, namely, that a number of issues could and should be done. The IFI workers in Arklow are currently subject to a programme that will lead to retraining under FÁS. I ask that that be brought forward and that the staff be made fully cognisant of what exactly is planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Second, in the case of Arklow, we have an enterprise centre which has already been cleared for over €750,000. It will need a further injection. I ask the Minister to be as generous as possible in that regard and to do everything that is possible with Enterprise Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">IFI and all other companies operate in a particular economic environment. I wish that IFI were not going to the wall, but it is, and the circumstances have been well flagged for many years. All the political hand-wringing in the world will not resolve the particular problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">I welcome the package that is being put before the House. In so far as there is any surplus on the liquidation, I hope it will be set aside and used to the benefit of the workers. As has probably been mentioned by other contributors, there are probably small creditors involved. Certainly, there are many people involved in the transport operation in Wexford and Wicklow. I ask that the financial institutions show forbearance. It is clear that the liquidation funds should be more than capable of meeting all the outstanding creditors, with the exception of the shareholders. With some common sense and prompting from the Department, the financial institutions could be asked to exercise a little more understanding and some patience in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I obviously regret that we are in this situation, but it is fundamentally dishonest to suggest that there has not been a real effort to keep this company in operation.</p>

There are immediate problems facing the employees who were let off last week without any payment. We are dealing with this Estimate to provide a forum or system whereby they can receive a payment. As the Minister said in his speech, the amount to be paid will be the lower of €5,000 or three months' pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">A question that was raised by many employees related to the trust deed set up to allow this to be proceeded with and they felt that they were signing away other rights for which they might wish to fight. The trust deed has been modified so it now reads such that people will sign it, but all that will be set off will be the amount of money they will get from the future funds that they will receive.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">Yes, that is what will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Concerns have been raised that people who are offered jobs would not be able to take them up if they did not get redundancy forms, so we have been in touch with the liquidator to ensure that any individuals who have an offer of a job will be treated preferentially. Those employees should inform the liquidator immediately of that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I hope the liquidator will make a success of this liquidation, that he will have a surplus and that this surplus will be available to provide extra funding for the employees and any of the other creditors who may not be paid during the liquidation. I am glad that the agencies are actively involved in aiding the employees who have been, and will be, laid off. Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, those involved with social welfare and county enterprise boards are actively involved in helping people with their difficulties and trying to get them new jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The cost of decommissioning has been mentioned frequently. I understand that the liquidator feels he will be in a position to sell the plant and that whoever will purchase it will be required to dismantle it at his or her expense. Thereafter, the question of the clean up of the area arises. From an environmental report that has been prepared, I understand that the cost of cleaning up will be in single figures and minimal in the context of the total value of the site in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Furthermore, I commend the fact that the Government has, in principle, decided to subordinate loans of £34 million to the company in favour of other creditors, which means that there will be more funding available, in principle, for the payment of creditors. This will be of immense benefit in terms of the payment of creditors and employees.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_625">This is a terrible mess and as the main shareholder, the Government must take responsibility for it. Some of those employed at IFI gave a lifetime of service to the State, yet they were given less than a day's notice of the closure of the company. They were told to pack their bags and leave. A worker told me it was more or less a case of lunch boxes being left in the fridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, who is no longer present, told the House that problems at the company were known about for years, but he went on to say that nothing was known until recently. I do not know how he can reconcile those statements. It appears the problems came to a head last January when it became known that the company was in serious trouble. However, the minor matter of the general election had to be held before action could be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The proposed redundancy settlement provides, on average, for a payment of two and a half to three weeks' wages for every year of service, which is considerably less than the norm. The workers are seeking five to six weeks' wages for each year of service, which would be more usual. A lump sum payment of €50,000 is not a large amount, especially to those who will probably never work again. The job market in the east Cork area for workers of that age is not good. I submitted a parliamentary question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the position regarding the workers at ISPAT. She indicated that 75% of those who wanted employment got jobs, but many of those are FÁS training jobs and could not be described as real employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Will the Minister outline what will happen to life insurance cover and to cover for spouses, which is removed when the pension scheme is closed? The workers received letters last week informing them they were without jobs. Will the Minister indicate if this means that, legally, they are unemployed? They did not receive RP1 or P45 forms, but merely a note telling them to leave. That is not good enough. Will the Minister indicate if they are or are not employed? There are those who maintain they are entitled to their wages because they are available and willing to work but have not been officially dismissed. Will the Minister outline their status?</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, indicated that the liquidator will look after those employees who get job offers. What is his role in their getting employment? Prospective employers, of whom there will be very few, will seek P45 or RP1 forms. Mention of the role of the liquidator is more of a smokescreen.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_631">They have not received them. Why was action taken in this manner? I believe the employees are entitled to be paid until such time as they receive their RP1 forms because they have not been officially dismissed. Will the Minister explain why the Government is putting them on the dole when it should be paying them?</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I hope the amount of money being made available is only a start and I plead with the Government to ensure more money will be provided. It sets a bad example to the private sector if this is how the Government, as the main shareholder in the company, treats the workers. How can a Government credibly tell private sector employers not to treat their workers in a similar manner?</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The protection of employment legislation provides that workers who are made redundant should be given some form of notice. I was under the impression that the Government would act under its own rules, but this is not happening. Many of the workers had life pensions. Will the Minister indicate what will happen to them?</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The workers and the company worked very hard to try to keep the company open, but the Government pulled the plug without warning. They held meetings with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in good faith. They were trying to cut costs and were willing to negotiate some redundancies. It augurs badly for the future for State employees or for anyone involved in negotiations with the Government. If negotiations are under way with the Government it should at least have the courtesy to tell those involved that things will not work out. I hope the Government will do the right thing by the workers and at least double the amount of money it is proposing to make available.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I thank Deputy Stanton for sharing his time. The workers at the IFI plant at Marina Point in Cork – they are the ones I know best – have been treated disgracefully. It is even more disgraceful that with the Government as majority shareholder, the company acted in the way it did in what has been described this evening as an orderly wind down of IFI, a description I find difficult to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Let me outline what the workers had to put up with. Most of them read in a British newspaper that IFI was closing down. They were not even given the courtesy of a telephone call. They got no warning of the closure and there was no statu tory notice. They were not even given the time to put a rescue package together.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_638">It is. The workers asked for a two week period to finalise a rescue package for presentation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but they were not granted even that. That aspect was debated with the Minister in the House a number of weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The workers were laid off with no payments except for their up to date wages, which I am not sure even included holiday pay due to some of them. No RP1 forms were issued, which makes it almost impossible for them to quickly secure new employment. I am not sure it is legally possible to secure new employment without those forms, yet they still have not got them. No statutory redundancy was agreed and as far as I am aware, even the redundancy fund that is now being proposed is being strongly opposed by workers who are very unhappy with it. They have been laid off and nothing has been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">To add insult to injury, the workers cannot even ascertain the facts about the current position of their pension fund, to which they have contributed for years. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, told the House that all Members, if they are truthful with themselves, are aware of the position regarding pension funds which, in this instance, is the responsibility of the trustee. The Minister stated, "The position of the schemes covering the other workers remains unclear at this stage and it seems likely that it will take some time before the trustees of the fund can establish the full facts". We have known for months that IFI was under threat of closure, yet it is only now, after the workers have been laid off, that we are trying to establish the facts regarding the pension fund. That is how the Government has treated workers who have given 25 or 30 years to a State-owned and State-run company. It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I wish to reinforce a point made by Deputy Boyle regarding the 26,000 tonnes of ammonia currently stored in IFI with only four people responsible for it. That is an awesome responsibility should anything go wrong. IFI workers said in a Cork newspaper yesterday that they would work free of charge to ensure that the necessary safety precautions are in place to look after the ammonia. Does the Government plan to put a more comprehensive and structured package in place to ensure we do not have an environmental catastrophe in Cork harbour?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NedOKeeffe" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. This is a very important and sad matter for my constituency due to the job losses. I pay tribute to the workers for the orderly manner in which they are doing their business even though they have been thrown on the scrap heap at short notice. I met them on three  occasions and am proud to be associated with them. Sometimes in such situations things get rough and Deputies on all sides get blamed, but on this occasion the workers have been well behaved.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The safety aspect is of major concern to all in the area. Will the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment ensure that the statutory requirements in regard to health and safety are put in place? We have seen a breakdown in the pension trust which was regulated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. There has also been a breakdown in the area of labour and employment law which is regulated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Such lapses are serious as we in this House pride ourselves on putting legislation through that is for the common good. In this case all of the regulations appear to have collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">It is imperative that the issues of the remaining liquid ammonia and the six large vessels which contain various catalysts be addressed. I am not a scientific expert but I understand that the potential dangers could have devastating effects for residents of the area and across the harbour. Such threats to the area existed in the past due to a lax approach to the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The uncertainty which prevails is a cause of grave concern. I understand that a creditors' meeting is planned for Leopardstown racecourse on Friday, 8 November. I inquired as to why Leopardstown was the chosen venue and was told that the expected crowd would be so large that the legal requirement would not be covered if some remained outside due to a lack of space to accommodate them. The workers will be on one side and the service industry will be on the other. Many people in the constituency are in grave financial difficulties and there is no point in appealing to the financial institutions because they have their own businesses to run. People who have diggers, tractors and loaders, hauliers, mechanical workers and the service industry generally were employed in that area and they are now in dire straits. If these people's problems are not addressed they will have no choice but to go to the wall, which is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I am also concerned about the progress that was being made in the area of rail development with the proposed extension of the Cork railway line to Carrigtwohill and probably Midleton and Youghal. I understand that the railway line from Cobh could be at risk and I seek clarification on the matter because it is basically a passenger service. Many years before I came into this House the railway line was also at risk but the development of industry in the area gave it a status and recognition that kept it maintained over the years because of the transport of ammonia and various materials and goods to that industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I obtained a copy of the FÁS document distributed at Marino Point. While I do not wish to criticise it, I did not see how it offered much hope to the IFI workers. Apart from a stated commitment to help those recently made redundant, there was  no immediate offer of help. No jobs were on offer and courses were not even available. What kind of hope was that to hand out as a preamble to filling in FÁS forms? The document professed a commitment to the redundant workers but in reality I do not see much future for workers in their 40s or 50s. The meeting was no more than an exchange of views and an opportunity for workers to ask questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I welcome the Minister's announcement of €20 million which he claims will give an average payment of €50,000 per worker. I understand that the average private sector redundancy payment is in the region of €80,000, which indicates a shortfall for those unfortunates who have given many years to this company. It is many years since Jack Lynch, God be good to him, opened that plant in 1979. That was a flagship day for the constituency of Cork East and we now see its demise.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Deputies who do not have their tax clearance certificates are faced with expulsion from this House. If we make an error we have to go before the Public Offices Commission. Where are the people who ran this business and who is going to challenge them?</p>

          <p eId="para_651">It is about time that the legislation we put in place was enforced. The pension fund which we heard so much about over many years and which is so important to people, is in crisis. It is at 1996 levels of investment – which is not bad by any standards – but are there any other irregularities? If anyone in the private sector made someone redundant with the kind of notice seen in this case he or she would face the severity of the courts and would appear before the Employment Appeals Tribunal as well as the many other issues that would arise. Look at the difficulties that arose with Irish Shipping and the problems surrounding the difficulties with the privatisation of Irish Life. Other parties were in Government at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The consultant's report on the viability of the plants should be made available to this House. I understand that it states that Arklow and Belfast are viable but the Cobh plant is not. They will be sold off. Cobh will be sold at scrap value and that will not be enough to clear up the site and make it viable once again. Let there be no doubt about that. It would not be possible to pay someone to take it for scrap and dismantle it. We have two plants for sale which will probably be sold at a knock-down price. I do not want to cause disillusionment because these workers are decent people and many of them are supporters of my party and helped to put us here. The dismantling of the plant is one thing but the asset value is not going to exceed the liabilities and let no one tell me otherwise. I have been around for long enough and know how these things work. We will be faced with a situation where the liquidator will not have sufficient funding to complete the job. The workers are on one side and the service  workers are on the other side, and there may be other people I do not know about.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I make an appeal that we rescue this situation. We are the people with statutory control of the country. I am a Government Deputy and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs have an obligation in regard to pensions and labour law and so on to keep the House in order.</p>

          <p eId="para_654">I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate and who have considered the matter from a position of concern with regard to the workers on what has developed so abruptly. I will take individual expressions of concern back to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and make sure they are followed up, particularly in regard to the safety issues which were raised by a number of Deputies. My understanding is that safety precautions are being adhered to, but if there is some local knowledge that this is not the case, I will convey that to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">As I outlined in my opening statement, the Government is taking a number of positive steps to help IFI employees. One of the concerns raised by the unions was the fact that employees were only paid up to the date of the collapse of the company and were then left without any income. I thank the House for facilitating this motion by agreement which will allow an interim payment of at least €5,000 for each worker on account so that they will have some cashflow. This initiative is being taken in response to the concerns of unions. The Government and the ICI have agreed to provide approximately €25 million to cover <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payments to the workers and, together with their statutory entitlements, the total payable to them will be approximately €32 million, which equates to €50,000 per worker.</p>

Their position can be determined only in time when the company's assets have been realised and the statement of affairs, which will be presented to creditors on Friday, will give an indication of what can be expected. The Government and the shareholders have agreed in principle to subordinate their loans amounting to £34 million to the company in favour of the creditors, which will significantly improve their position.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_679">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_680">I am pleased to present the Bill to the House. Its enactment will enable Ireland to accede to the Council of Europe agreement on illicit traffic by sea implementing article 17 of the United Nations Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, done at Strasbourg on 31 January 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The international community has provided a framework for dealing with certain drug trafficking offences at sea, which is contained in the United Nations Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, more commonly known as the Vienna convention, adopted by the UN in Vienna in December 1988. Ireland has given effect to the provisions of the convention by the enactment of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which led to the ratification of the convention by Ireland on 3 September 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Arising from Ireland's obligations under the UN convention, it is an offence under domestic law for a person on an Irish ship or a ship registered in a convention state or a ship not registered in any state or territory, no matter where the ship may be, either to be in the possession of  controlled drugs or involved in the carrying of such drugs, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that the drugs are to be imported or exported contrary to Irish law or a corresponding law of any other country. At present, the Irish authorities may stop, board and detain a ship registered in a convention state where such drug trafficking is suspected provided that convention state agrees.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The other convention states have enacted similar laws so that there is a shared jurisdiction among all convention states. However, the UN convention is silent on the consequences of shared jurisdiction, in particular on which state ought to prosecute in such circumstances, although the terms of the convention recognise the need for further improvements of these provisions by providing in article 17 for regional agreements to enhance effectiveness in this area such as is contained in the Council of Europe agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The purpose of the agreement is to build on the provisions of the UN convention and deal with the issue of shared jurisdiction by making provision for the concept of preferential jurisdiction. This in effect gives a flag state the right to seek to exercise jurisdiction concerning any drug trafficking offence committed on board its vessel on the high seas in priority to the jurisdiction of another convention state. The agreement makes provision for the procedure to be followed by the Council of Europe member states in applying the concept of preferential jurisdiction between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">As is clear from the explanatory report published with the agreement, the experts involved in drafting the agreement considered that, in practice, the normal case would be that the relevant offence or offences would be prosecuted by the authorities of the intervening state. However, there might occasionally, for reasons of policy or on an <i> ad hoc </i>basis, be situations where a flag state might wish to prosecute the suspect and the agreement sets out in detail the rules to deal with such a situation. The Bill gives a statutory basis to the concept of preferential jurisdiction and makes provision for the legislative mechanism to give effect to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">If, for example, a foreign ship on the high seas off the coast of Ireland was suspected of carrying drugs, the authorities of the flag state could under the convention request Ireland or, alternatively, Ireland could seek permission from the flag state to stop, board and search the ship. If evidence of drugs was found, the ship could be taken to and detained in an Irish port and the crew arrested. The crew would, however, be guilty of a drug trafficking offence not only under Irish law but also under the law of the flag state.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The Council of Europe agreement seeks to establish an agreed method of dealing with such a situation by giving the flag state preferential jurisdiction. In this example the flag state would have the right to insist on prosecuting the crew  and could, therefore, under the agreement require the crew, the ship and any evidence found on board the ship to be surrendered to it by the Irish authorities. Alternatively, under an unusual requirement of the agreement, to which I shall return later, the flag state could simply require the release of the ship and the crew.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">notes that the Higher Education Authority had sought only a 7% increase in registration charges, that as recently as May 14th his own Department was predicting an increase of just 6%, and that the huge increase was imposed as a direct consequence of the memo issued by the Minister for Finance demanding cuts;</p>
          <p eId="para_692">considers the Minister's decision to introduce an unwarranted and unnecessary increase to be a Government cutback in education funding;</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_699">There are two possible reasons the Minister lobbed his notion of the reintroduction of third level fees into the post-election air at the end of September. Either he intends to reintroduce fees and decided to fly a kite to test the political atmosphere for reaction or he  decided to threaten to reintroduce fees to divert attention from the savage cutbacks and price increases he is implementing. The latter reason is more likely. The notion of fees for the well off is a simplistic sop to the public. It suggests a type of even-handedness in the ruthless chopping of the education budget. It is not a coincidence that just two days before the Minister floated his idea <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> published a leaked document which revealed extensive Government planned cuts. Among the sharpest was a cut of €150 million from the budget of the Department of Education and Science. That was just two days before the Minister flew his kite about reintroducing third level fees. These cuts are across the education budget and at all levels, including primary, secondary, third level and second chance education for people who did not have opportunities at a younger age.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The Minister had already hiked the third level registration charge by a massive 70%. On 12 September he cut €6 million from the school retention initiative, €3.8 million from the back to education initiative, €5 million from the access programme and €2 million from the second level building programme. These cuts directly hit programmes designed to counteract educational disadvantage. The Minister said that educational disadvantage was the main focus of his attention when he was appointed. While he talks about his commitment to tackling disadvantage, he wields the axe of the Minister for Finance to cut the programmes which are making a difference. That is one of the main reasons the proposal to reintroduce third level fees was suggested at the time. It was a diversionary tactic to take the public's attention away from the cuts which had already been put in place. It is not the first time the Minister has flown kites. In his former ministry, he made suggestions and proposals which were designed to deflect attention from the fact that issues in his Department were not being addressed. The Minister cannot talk tough about tackling educational disadvantage, while proceeding to slash budgets designed specifically to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Labour Party motion addresses the drastic increase in registration charges which has created hardship for many students and their families. I know of many families who, when they were faced with this huge increase in registration charges, did not know what to do or where to find the money. Some students were not able to go to third level because of the large increase in a charge which was suddenly introduced after students got their leaving certificate results and were in a position to avail of opportunities in the third level sector. Many of those families are on tight budgets. They measure every cent spent every week. This increase is an obstacle. The Minister has underestimated the hardship it has caused to families.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The second part of the motion addresses the suggested reintroduction of third level fees. The  third part addresses the failure to implement the recommendations of the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education. It is shameful that the recommendations have not been implemented. It is crucial that the problems of people who do not have access to third level education are addressed. We all know those problems start at an earlier age than 17 or 18 when students are ready to go to third level education. The education system has failed many young people in our society. Unless we address their problems at an earlier age, they will not be in a position to take up third level education. The former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, introduced the Breaking the Cycle programme. She also introduced other programmes specifically designed to address the difficulties faced by young people who do not progress through the education system. Those programmes have not been continued or expanded since she left office.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">It is shameful that we have not addressed the problems of many young people who do not have a future in the education system and who drop out before the official school leaving age. Only a pittance is paid to the needs of such young people. There are some excellent special schools throughout the country which cater for young people who do not fit into the normal school system. However, there are long waiting lists for them and they are starved of funds. The recommendations in the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education must be implemented if we want to give opportunities to the young people whom the system has failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">While the proposal on fees may be a diversionary tactic, it must be addressed head on. I call on the Minister to state his and the Government's position tonight. He might look back to one of his predecessors, Donogh O'Malley, who, against the advice of his Department, abolished fees for second level education in 1967. At that time it was seen as a gift to the middle classes. I remember it because I was in the school system at the time. The working classes and the children of the unemployed rarely made it to leaving certificate level. Many of them dropped out at an earlier stage of the education system. Times have changed since 1967, but Donogh O'Malley has been proved right. The pattern did not change straight away. It took decades before it was the norm for students to complete second level education. Over the years the numbers who completed second level increased rapidly and Donogh O'Malley's detractors were proven wrong. Would anyone in the House propose the reintroduction of second level fees? I do not think so. Nobody in this House can deny the extraordinary contribution that decision made to the social, educational, economic and political landscape and to individual lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Many commentators argue that the Celtic tiger was born largely of the investment made in education over the years since second level fees were abolished and the increasing numbers of univer sity graduates and highly qualified workers that has generated. The abolition of third level fees 29 years later in 1996 by Niamh Bhreathnach was a progression in access to the opportunities of education which built on Donogh O'Malley's pioneering decision. The results of her decision will also take decades to become fully apparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Professor Patrick Clancy's detailed research on who goes to college shows that patterns are changing and the children of those in the low to middle income bracket, whose participation had been dropping, are now attending third level in increasing numbers. My colleague, Senator Tuffy, has carried out a precise study of the statistics in Professor Clancy's various reports. It is clear from these that the introduction of free fees has turned around the participation in third level among the PAYE sector of the population, which has made such a significant contribution to the growth of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">It is worth considering these figures which my colleagues will consider in more detail later. Professor Clancy's research, which divided society into a number of categories, demonstrated that children from the lowest income brackets are still not progressing into third level in great numbers. This is largely due to the lack of intervention and support at a much earlier age in the primary and secondary levels. While I accept that access programmes, where available, are doing very good work and have facilitated the progress of some individual students into third level, they remain underdeveloped.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The statistics show that the next categories, the lower PAYE income groups, have benefited most from the introduction of free third level fees. As such, it is trite to suggest that their introduction has not facilitated participation among sectors of society which were not fully participating previously. The figures show there has already been a change. From developments after the abolition of second level fees by former Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, we can deduce that participation rates will change further. Surely the PAYE sector, which has worked hard, has no spare income and has valued the abolition of fees for third level education, has the right to benefit from the economy it has built in recent years?</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Access to education at all levels should be provided by a good society for its citizens through the tax system. It is not a privilege for those with money who will make damn sure their children get the best possible education regardless of circumstances. It is a false argument to suggest we must deny others free third level education to stop this group getting something for nothing from the public purse. Some services must be provided by society as of right and must be paid for through taxes, and surely equality of access to education is one of them? It is a mark of a truly civilised society that it values education and regards it as a mark of equality, rather than a badge of privilege. Society should offer all children the opportunity to progress through the education system and make the best possible use of  it, both for their personal development and the opportunity to make a living.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Minister for Education and Science should stop pussyfooting around the issue and come clean. Does he intend to reintroduce third level fees? The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and many Government backbenchers have voiced opposition to the measure. The Minister must tell us if he plans to proceed with this measure, otherwise this kite will fly around distracting our attention from the real cuts he has already made in the education budget. I guarantee the Minister that the ordinary working man or woman with a child in third level education will rise up in anger if he proceeds with plans to penalise them. The ordinary PAYE worker cannot afford to put a child through college as matters stand, not to mention if fees are reintroduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I return to the increase in registration fees, which constitutes a real charge for third level education. Whereas the authorities asked for an increase of just 7%, a rise of 69% was delivered. Where is this money going? Is it being channelled into the education budget or into the black hole which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has created through his mismanagement of the economy? In the last month alone, €1 billion has gone astray.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Surely this is not the time to impose hardship on students? Education is a right, not a privilege. It would be better to ensure that those people making huge sums of money in our economy pay an appropriate amount of tax. For example, certain people in receipt of huge tax breaks for building student accommodation are able to transfer such tax breaks to other rented property they hold and thus avoid paying substantial amounts of tax.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">These include the bloodstock industry, to which my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, referred earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The Minister has created unfair hardship for our young people, the third level students and those students who cannot get into third level because he has not implemented the access programmes. We should be providing our young people with an education system paid for through the tax system, while ensuring that people on high incomes pay an appropriate amount of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The proposal on fees is a means of flying a kite to divert attention from what is not being done in education and from the hardship that has been imposed on third level students. Funding is required in many other areas of education where  the necessary money has not been forthcoming. If the Minister leaves a question mark hanging over the reintroduction of third level fees, that issue rather than the right of our young people to an education, will become the focus of attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I ask him to support the motion which seeks to secure the right of our children to access education, whether primary, secondary or third level. Just as important, indeed in some ways more important, is access to second chance education for people who did not have an opportunity to go on to third level when they were young. These people do not have the opportunities they need. The cut in the literacy budget is abhorrent. The funding required to implement the proposed access programme has obviously not been allocated which means second chance students are not getting the opportunities they were promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I ask the Minister to seriously address the issues covered by the motion, in particular the problems students are facing in funding their third level education and the problems experienced by those students who are not getting into third level education because the access programmes are not being funded.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_721">Like my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, I believe education is a right, not a privilege. Against that background I am gravely concerned by what the Minister has implemented first by way of registration fees and second in terms of his threat to reintroduce tuition fees. Each of these steps is retrograde in terms of access and the right to education to which all our children are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The threat to reintroduce tuition fees and the actual increase in registration fees is as much about the fundamental right to education as it is about additional financial burdens arising from tuition fees. It is not right or fair that those people who can pay for the privilege can access education while those who cannot must do without once again. It is a serious indictment of the attitude of the Government to education that one of the first cutbacks or adjustments, depending on one's preferred description, that was mooted was the reintroduction of third level fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The first bombshell was the 70% increase in the registration fee, which caused problems for many students. The Minister may not think that a hike of €350 is of any consequence to students or their parents, but to many of the people I know it is a major budgetary problem and has to be planned for. This increase was followed by the shock announcement that the Minister was considering reintroducing tuition fees. If the €350 increase in the registration fee caused consternation, we should remind ourselves that tuition fees are likely to be of the order of €3,000 to €4,000. The consternation generated by the increase of €350 would be increased tenfold by the introduction of full fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The argument in favour of reintroducing third level fees is that the system discriminates in fav our of those who can already afford to pay them, but that is not sustainable. As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, this has not been the result of the removal of fees which were removed to create a level playing field, but that has not happened because the factors involved have little to do with fees and have to be addressed from an educational point of view. Any parent of a student can tell one the real cost of attending third level and that adding fees to accommodation and other costs would put a college education beyond the scope of many on middle incomes who are mainly PAYE workers such as teachers, nurses and civil servants. Interestingly, Senator Mansergh made the point in the other House, when disagreeing with the reintroduction of fees, that the income threshold would be way below that of the very wealthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">It is worthwhile to look at what has happened in the United Kingdom following the reintroduction of fees. The numbers attending third level have dropped and many who enrolled have incurred tremendous debts. We could expect the exact same to happen here. We would be further discriminated against in comparison with most of our European counterparts who do not pay fees. It is common practice, as the Minister will know, for student exchanges to take place as part of a number of undergraduate courses and EU students would not be enthusiastic about coming here on discovering that they would be expected to pay a crippling tuition fee. Our students would be indirectly excluded from some of the best universities and third level colleges in Europe if this was to proceed, not because of academic failure, but because we would penalise them financially. Who would want to embark on an exchange programme when they have free education in their own country but must pay to come here?</p>
          <p eId="para_726">A major concern about third level education has been the rate of non-completion of courses. A factor identified in leading to this has been the number of students obliged to work in order to subsidise their education. The additional burden fees would place on this element of attendants can be imagined. More students would be engaged in part-time work, those already working would take on additional hours, academic standards would suffer and the drop-out rate would increase. Imposing fees would mean that those who are academically capable would be deprived of an entitlement to achieve their full potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Instead of taking that regressive step, the education system should be overhauled to identify the pressures being imposed on students who are made to feel that the only respectable and rewarding option is to go to college to get a diploma or a degree. We should look at this area in the light of the reintroduction of fees because the emphasis on points in the leaving certificate has reached the level of absurdity. Students are not being educated and, depending on the school they attend, treated like battery hens, cocooned in a hothouse environment and force fed information which is later regurgitated in the rarefied  atmosphere of an examination hall over a five or six day period.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I do not lay the blame on schools, parents and teachers who find themselves a part of this system, but matters are this way because we have all capitulated in relation to the points system. Memory and speed writing form a major part of the criteria determining the suitability of a student to access third level. If the publicity surrounding the examinations in June and the results in August is the yardstick for our education system, we can be forgiven for thinking that only points and a place in college are synonymous with educational success and fulfilment. What happened to apprenticeships and trades? Are the same supports put in place to allow those with a leaning in that direction to achieve and is there a commitment to career guidance that allows students to consider other options?</p>
          <p eId="para_729">It is fundamental to the development of society and the economy that as many as possible are educated to their potential and best positioned to make a contribution, but it is inherently wrong and exclusive to presume that everybody needs or wants to go to third level college. This may well be the time to revisit the policy of access and interest. Equality of access is blatantly absent from our third level system. Our efforts nationally must be targeted and re-evaluated to redress the present imbalances which the reintroduction of fees would do nothing to achieve. Instead of the reintroduction of fees as proposed by the Minister, it would be more appropriate to consider offering opportunities to mature and part-time students deprived of them when they left school. The commitment of the Government to life-long learning will be tested by its commitment to providing equality of opportunity for all students, including those who, through economic disadvantage at a particular time, were unable to avail of third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">We refer frequently to the quality of our education system, of which, overall, we have many reasons to be very proud. We like to think that we have an excellent system and that our graduates compare with the best in the world, but if the Minister is hell-bent on returning us to the dark ages educationally by depriving many of the opportunity to avail of the education to which they are entitled, we will regress economically and socially.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_731">During the campaign leading up to the recent referendum the Taoiseach used the word "dingbat" rather freely and it is as good a word as any to describe the notion of the Minister for Education and Science to reintroduce third level fees. Laughably, he tries to wrap this policy in the flag of social justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">We have two means-tested benefits, one of which is third level maintenance grants and the other medical cards. There is not a Deputy in this House who can defend the operation of either scheme and the inevitable injustices, poverty traps and anomalies each throws up. In 1996 Dr.  Donal de Buitléar examined the operation of third level maintenance grants in minute detail, showing up the extraordinary anomalies in the system where PAYE workers in urban areas are refused grants while many self-employed persons with substantial assets get them easily. This is also true of the operation of the medical card system where small increases in income deprive families of this benefit due to the operation of rigid means tests which create dreadful poverty traps.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Means tests are no way to distribute wealth and benefits and the notion that they are an effective mechanism to target resources has been contradicted time and again by the evidence. Usually, they spawn a massive and costly bureaucracy with the side effect of huge costs in implementation and policing. They are bad news and bad policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I remind the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, of what he said in this House during the dreary arguments a decade ago about the ill fated residential property tax. He was very fond of pointing to the ordinary middle-class families drawn into the net of that particular tax. I recall him mentioning on many occasions in the House and in the media couples he knew in his constituency. He spoke of two teachers who were married to each other, a garda married to a nurse and similar families, all with reasonable incomes, but who were far from being rich or well to do. He did not believe that couples like those should be landed with a property tax even though that tax was relatively modest. How can he or his colleagues now suggest that such couples should be landed with a heavy cost burden to pay tuition fees for their children when they go to college? Quite apart from other college costs, fees at the level of €4,000 or €5,000 would be a far greater burden on modest earning middle class families than the hated property tax a decade ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">It is all very well to say, as the Minister has said quite freely, that so-called middle class families can easily afford fees. That may be the case if one defines "well off" as income thresholds around the salaries of a Cabinet Minister or advisers to the Taoiseach. The report of the Revenue Commissioners does not suggest many families fall within that range of salary. From the experience of the covenant system in the 1990s, everyone here knows it created the kind of subterfuge that benefited the very well off while it afforded almost no relief to those on lesser incomes. From the rather torturous debate that has been going on in Fianna Fáil, I note that the <i>quid pro quo</i> for the reintroduction of fees is to reintroduce some form of tax relief. Let the Minister be warned that one of the reasons fees were abolished in the first place was that the covenants were an outrageous cost and were entirely to the benefit of the extremely well off upper middle classes. The introduction of fees was more than substantially paid for by the abolition of the then covenant system in relation to all forms of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">I do not pretend that higher education finance is an easy topic for a Minister, but the introduction of full tuition fees is not the answer. The Minister has only to look across the water to realise the damaging effect of the re-introduction of fees in England. He might well also observe that one of the first acts of the independent Scottish Executive was to quickly reverse that policy when it got the chance. That was done because Scottish people have always valued the notion of mass participation in higher education whereas in England that notion was fatally destroyed by the Thatcher Government during its period in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">I acknowledge that graduates by and large earn higher incomes as a result of their subsidised education, but equally the State benefits from the higher income and expenditure taxes they ultimately pay and from investment in third level education. Such investment in free tuition fees pays for itself over the years and is as sound an infrastructural investment as that in roads or railways. In a knowledge based society it is an essential investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Free fees are in existence for far too short a time to judge their effectiveness in terms of social justice. The full primary and secondary school cycle is 12 years and, therefore, it is impossible to make such a judgment yet. Taking account of all third level institutions, university and non-university, some progress is already apparent. The Minister, who drives home by Blanchardstown, must be aware of the increased participation from his constituency of Meath as a consequence of the existence of Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and the same is true in the south western part of Dublin with the advent of the Tallaght Institute of Technology. One cannot draw conclusions from the intake of a few university institutions in Dublin only. Guidance counsellors in many disadvantaged areas report an increased interest in third level opportunities among pupils who complete the secondary school cycle. This is the key, but it is an area where the Government has failed during the past six years. The number of pupils who drop out at junior certificate level or who do not finish the leaving certificate programme has risen alarmingly and not nearly enough has been done to counteract this. Some of the expenditure adjustments made by the Minister in recent months have affected these programmes, which encourage second level pupils to graduate on completing the leaving certificate. I am not satisfied with the access programmes of most of the big institutions. Many are window dressing and have little impact in offering genuine opportunities to go to college.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">One element essential to education is a sense of excitement and opportunity. What is key in the notion of free tuition fees paid for by universal taxation is that any child, irrespective of his or her parents' attitude to third level education, knows that one day he or she can go to college because third level education is available and anyone can walk through the gates of Trinity Col lege, UCD or the Institute of Technology in Blanchardstown. To let go of that notion and availability of opportunity will rank as one of the most regressive and reactionary positions ever taken by a Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">When Bill Clinton talked about the development of his economic philosophy, I recall he identified hope and opportunity as the cornerstones in generating equality of opportunity and social progress. To reintroduce third level fees would be to say goodbye to much of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I benefited from the opening of second level education by one the Minister's predecessors in the 1960s. I got opportunities at third level through grants and scholarships, but people from my background and the income level of my parents barely qualify for maintenance grants today because they are not farmers or self-employed. Fingal County Council and the Dublin west area has a population of 72,000, yet with a large PAYE urban population it gets only one third of the tuition grants awarded to County Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">No, it is a tribute to people in Mayo and elsewhere throughout rural Ireland that they value education, but it is also a tribute to the political system that it regards the third level education of farmers' children as important but does not regard such education of PAYE workers' children as of equal merit in the dispensing of third level grants. That is the problem and the Labour Party wants to address it through creating opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">It is strange that the people who wax indignant about the availability of third level tuition fees are among the most well off and well heeled commentators in our society and include people who are exceptionally well paid such as the heads of third level institutions and universities. Those institutions and universities have funding problems, but the heads of them should not seek to redress their funding problems by rowing in behind the ill-thought out and inappropriate notion of abolishing third level free tuition.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">As a consequence of free fees there has been a significant increase in the number of students going on to do masters and MBAs in respect of which full fees are paid. That has helped to provide us with an outstanding workforce capable of taking on world class challenges. If the Minister decides to reintroduce third level fees, I predict the number of students proceeding to master's degree and MBA will fall dramatically and by the end of the decade the Irish economy will be the worse for that.</p>

          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_746">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_747">To delete all words after "That Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_748">"commends the Government on its performance to date in achieving an expansion  of third level education places, in significantly increasing investment in third level education, in progressing a range of targeted measures aimed at developing the capacity of higher education to meet wider social and economic needs, and in developing the range of targeted initiatives aimed at improving access to and reducing attrition rates within the third level sector; and</p>
          <p eId="para_749">endorses the Government's objective to maximise the impact of public investment in third level education in terms of equitable participation and access from all sectors of society."</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I wish Deputy O'Sullivan all the best in her new role as Labour spokesperson on education. No doubt we will clash in future, as we will tonight, but I look forward to working with her. My Department will give her any assistance it can by way of briefing or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Education is a right, not a privilege. Unless we address the inequities in our system, third level education will remain a pipe dream for many of our young people, including the PAYE workers referred to earlier. I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded to me by this motion to focus on the Government's commitment to the development of the third level education sector in an inclusive and equitable manner. The record of investment in, and development of, the third level sector since 1997 by the Government has been outstanding by any objective measure. Full-time student numbers at third level exceeded 126,000 in 2000-01, representing an increase of 19,000, or 17%, on the numbers in 1996-97. Enrolments for part-time students increased by 41% in the same period. The net overall expenditure in the third level sector has increased by 95% since 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The most recent OECD study, Education at a Glance 2002, which was published last week, has pointed to the significant increase in expenditure per student in tertiary education in Ireland over the second half of the last decade. Ireland ranks second of 27 OECD countries in terms of the increase achieved. The manifestation of this increased investment can be seen on a number of fronts. The capacity of the sector to meet the skill needs of the economy has been developed through substantial targeted funding to provide new places in areas of identified need, such as ICT and health skills and through a number of innovative approaches to addressing skill needs while simultaneously providing enhanced opportunities for adult and mature learners. As part of these initiatives, 1,500 students have participated in accelerated technician programmes in the institutes of technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Rapid development of the research infrastructure in the third level sector has been achieved through the unprecedented levels of new investment. Cumulative investment under the programme for research in third level institutions, launched in 1998, and other research pro grammes, amounts to almost €150 million since 1998. This is exclusive of the research expenditure under the Higher Education Authority block grant which is estimated at €100 million this year. In addition to this, the establishment by the Government of a science and technology investment fund to develop technology at all levels ranging from primary schools to advanced research, has provided for an investment of €38 million for equipment renewal grants in the third level sector, €57 million for research and development, €76 million for skills needs and €102 million for infrastructural developments. Furthermore, a range of targeted initiatives are being funded by the Higher Education Authority to address priority issues such as attrition rates, participation rates and the quality of teaching within the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Notwithstanding this record of acknowledged and ongoing achievement, the issue of equity of access to higher education remains a priority. The HEA-commissioned report by Professor Patrick Clancy on access to third level education found substantial variability in the rates of admission to higher education. The report concluded that this variability reflects the socio-economic pattern of the population. In terms of admission rates by socio-economic groups, the report shows that there has been a significant improvement in the proportion of persons from the two lowest socio-economic groups entering higher education. In 1980, only 3% of persons from the unskilled manual workers group entered higher education and that increased to 12% in 1992 and 21% in 1998. In 1980, only 9% of persons coming from the semi-skilled manual workers group entered higher education and that increased to 19% in 1992 and 23% in 1998. Part of this increase in admission rates derived from the doubling of the overall admission rates to higher education since 1980.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">When the Government first came to office in 1997, spending on third level access measures totalled €508,000. Last year that figure had risen to €15.3 million and it is anticipated it will be €24 million this year. By any standards that represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources. In 1997 third level access measures were confined to just two funds, a special fund for students with disabilities and a hardship fund that was allocated to third level colleges for students experiencing financial hardship. That has been significantly developed through additional initiatives for special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants, and the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage, together with the allocation of an access officer post to each institute of technology in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Provision for the special fund for students with disability, which is ESF-aided, has increased from €277,000 in 1997 to €2.619 million in 2001, an increase of 845%. The purpose of this fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the  cost of special equipment, materials, technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistance and sign language interpreters. The number of approved applications increased from 511 in 2000 to 809 in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Financial support for students is also available in approved third level institutions through the student assistance access fund, formerly known as the hardship fund. The objective of this ESF-aided fund is to assist students who, due to their financial circumstances, are unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college. The provision for this fund has increased significantly from €231,000 in the 1997-98 academic year to €7.49 million in the 2001-02 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Since 1997, therefore, there have been very significant increases in the funding for measures that were already in operation. However, the Government has also been responsible for introducing significant new measures to combat disadvantage. There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling €120 million over the period 2000-06 to tackle disadvantage at third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">In line with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation at third level of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability. The action group's report was published in July 2001 and its most significant spending recommendation concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as "top-up grants" which were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year. My Department recently carried out a review of these special rates of maintenance grants. Following this review in July 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for special rates by 32% and also extended the eligibility criteria.</p>

As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in the 2002-03 academic year will double to 7,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The action group also made recommendations regarding a new millennium partnership fund for  disadvantage, which was implemented with effect from the 2001-02 academic year. This fund provides assistance for area partnerships to target disadvantaged students with a view to accessing third level education and to continue support while in college. Total funding provided for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million. I have increased the allocation for this fund to €2 million in 2002, an increase of 66%. This year 50 partnerships and community groups are receiving allocations and I have no doubt that this funding will have a major impact in terms of increased access to third level education by disadvantaged communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Other significant measures promoting third level access have also been introduced. It should not be forgotten that in 1998 the Government delivered on its promise to introduce a maintenance grants scheme for students on post-leaving certificate courses. In addition, since the 1999-2000 academic year the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable to all eligible mature students. In 2000-01 an access officer post was provided in each institute of technology to enhance access for disadvantaged students, thereby putting the institutes on a par with the university sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">For the 2002-03 academic year I approved an increase of 15% in the allowance by which the income thresholds in the maintenance grant schemes may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education. This is in line with the commitment in the June 2002 programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise that framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established. I have been in office as Minister for Education and Science for a relatively short period but have had an opportunity to review in detail the recommendations of the access report. I am pleased to inform the Dáil that I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that this national office will, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies, facilitate the aim of increasing third level access for the three target groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">In addition to the funding provided directly by my Department, third level colleges have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for disadvantaged students to third level education through targeted funding provided for the universities by the Higher Education Auth ority and, via funding from within the overall financial allocations, the institutes of technology. The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding for the universities and other Higher Education Authority designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education. One particular area of priority is that of broadening access to the universities and Higher Education Authority institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and Travellers. In 2001 the Higher Education Authority provided over €5 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed to provide for such broadened access.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The Higher Education Authority also undertakes periodic external evaluation of targeted initiatives. An evaluation of the initiative for access for disadvantaged students was carried out in 2000 by Osborne and Leith. The report notes that universities have responded positively to the challenges of creating a series of activities designed to enhance opportunities and that there is now a wider possibility of considering a national strategy to enhance initiatives at local level. The report of the evaluation was a key source document for the action group on access to third level. Likewise in the institutes of technology sector, actions to improve participation by the targeted groups are undertaken by all institutes. These actions include pre-course and on-course support systems for students from disadvantaged areas. I am committed to progressing the other recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and ensuring the issue of equity of access to equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my term of office as Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">With regard to the increase in the charge levied by third level institutions to defray the cost of registration, examinations and student services, I wish again to make clear that students eligible for means-tested student support will not have to pay the charge. The €670 charge will be paid on their behalf, either directly by my Department or through local authorities or vocational education committees. This means that at least 34% of students in universities and 47% of those in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">It is estimated that the annual cost per student of providing third level education in the 2002-03 academic year will exceed €6,000 for arts, law and business courses, €8,000 for science courses and €9,000 for engineering and medicine. This does not take into account the capital cost of new buildings and infrastructure. Any contribution from students has to be seen in the light of these figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The increase in the charge was part of an overall package of measures I announced earlier this year. These measures are aimed at increasing and improving the student support schemes for the 2002-03 academic year. In the current financial year the Government will spend over €360 million on student supports, including free fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">As Minister for Education and Science, I have responsibility to ensure that the available funding of €360 million in student supports is targeted in a manner that achieves maximum impact from the point of view of equity of access to third level education. Indeed, it would be negligent of me, in that context, to ignore the plain facts that continue to present regarding rates of higher education participation among the lower socio-economic groups, facts that are not challenged by anybody inside or outside this House. The progress we have made in this area has been painfully slow and has not had the meaningful impact I want to see on the basic inequity that has persisted under successive Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The question of how available funding for student supports, including free fees, can be best deployed is extremely significant against that background. In particular, how and whether individuals and their families who can afford to, should contribute to the costs of their higher education are questions we should be willing to debate. Can we as a society continue to justify the expenditure of millions of euro from within the finite resources available for student supports in order to meet the costs of free fees for the children of those in the highest income brackets when, at the same time, all the evidence shows that those at the other end of the economic spectrum continue to be excluded from third level education by virtue of, among other things, inadequate supports?</p>

          <p eId="para_774">Investment in third level education has a broad social and economic benefit. Nobody is arguing for the State to divest itself of its responsibilities and interests in that regard. However, the economic benefits of a higher education to the individual are also clear. It is clear from all the literature and studies that first and second level education benefits society generally as well as the individual. Higher education benefits the individual far more than society.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">The OECD study I referred to earlier, Education at a Glance 2002, shows that the career earning potential of graduates is significantly enhanced over and above those who do not progress beyond second level, with a tertiary education delivering a weekly earnings premium of up to 57% in Ireland. The difference is even  more striking when hourly earnings comparisons are made. The most recently available data, taken from the 1997 Living in Ireland survey conducted by the ESRI, indicates that individuals with a degree or above earn 83% more on average than individuals who completed their education with the leaving certificate or a post leaving certificate course. This is much greater than the earnings differential between the junior certificate and leaving certificate and suggests that third level degree qualifications attract a particularly high premium throughout an individual's working life.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">This represents a significant private return for the public investment made in higher education and brings the equity issues surrounding the principle of individual contributions sharply into focus. I am willing to address these difficult questions and that is why I have initiated a review of the application of student supports and free fees funding. These issues and principles are being debated in developed economies the world over, with a range of third level funding and contribution models to be found across the EU and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I would have thought my motivation in carrying out this review, that of addressing the inherent inequities within the present system, is one that would find favour with parties from the Labour Party tradition. The reaction of those on the Opposition benches, however, to the notion that I would endeavour to review the present system, is bizarre. Are we not being exhorted daily by the media and the Opposition parties to ensure we get value for money in the delivery of public services? Is it not a valid exercise to examine the objectives of abolishing fees, whether these objectives are being achieved and whether we could get better value for money from the €360 million we are spending?</p>

          <p eId="para_783">The original stated objective of the then Minister, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, in introducing free fees in 1995 was to widen and increase participation in third level education among those who were previously excluded. In the Dáil debate surrounding the introduction of free tuition fees, she pointed to the psychological  barrier faced by potential students from the lower socio-economic groups as a result of having to pay fees. The introduction of the free fees initiative was intended to remove that barrier. An argument I have heard recently and again tonight, that it will take several years for this psychological impact to take effect, simply does not impress. The introduction of free secondary education had an immediate impact at the time. Clearly, there are more complex factors at play regarding third level participation.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The evidence of participation rates at third level support the view that the free fees initiative has not achieved its original purpose. One of the more tangible outcomes of the measure appears to be the notable increase in the popularity of fee paying secondary schools, with well-off parents now diverting disposable income from an investment in their children's third level education to investment in more privileged second level education.</p>

          <p eId="para_789">Ms Bhreathnach's initiative was sold on the basis that it involved the re-focusing of State subvention through the tax system to provide finance for free fees without significant additional cost to the Exchequer. The review I have commissioned of the student support measures merely seeks to determine, as Ms Bhreathnach did in 1995, whether the resources now being put into the system are achieving the desired effect or whether they could be redirected to achieve a better effect. Considering the time lapse since the introduction of free fees and the major question marks over the achievement of the stated purpose behind them, it seems appropriate that the measures should be fundamentally reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">This Government's track record in education is second to none. We will continue to invest heavily in education. In doing so we will continue to place a premium on our children's future and on ensuring that we can continue to meet the economic and social challenges we face. In doing this, we are committed to ensuring that everyone, whatever their social or economic circumstances, has an equal opportunity to participate fully in education at all levels. That should be a fundamental principle of any equitable education system and it is incumbent on all Members to acknowledge and confront past failures on that front. I hope the review will point the way to the  achievement of real progress in the future towards that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Deputy O'Sullivan got her chronology a little mixed up. She moved it around to suit her conspiracy theory regarding when I first mentioned educational disadvantage and third level fees. She said the programmes introduced by Niamh Bhreathnach had not expanded. They have expanded substantially over the past number of years. A significant number of disadvantage schemes are in place. It probably could be argued that we need to focus on the schemes to see whether we are getting value for money and are reaching the target audience. Where there is limited financial support, it is legitimate for me, as Minister, and for Members of the House to ask whether we are spending money in the most effective way to ensure the greatest number of our young people can participate in all levels of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Deputy Burton talked about anomalies in the higher education grants system and I have a duty to examine those anomalies, to review the scheme and try to ensure that as many people as possible can participate in it.

          <p eId="para_796">Before commencing my contribution, I would like to wish Deputy O'Sullivan well in her new position.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">I accept that the Minister has a duty to address anomalies in the education system, yet there are further anomalies in what he has said here. He questioned Deputy O'Sullivan's comments about the number of programmes available to people with disadvantage, yet when he mentioned fees he admitted the progress made in that area has been painfully slow. That is the truest thing the Minister has said in this debate. Progress has been slow but we must ask why and who has been responsible for the development of these access programmes for the past five years – it is the same Government whose members sit opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The lack of information concerning third level fees makes this issue a leap into the unknown. There is a lack of economic clarity and we do not know who initiated these proposals. There appears to be nothing but confusion in the Government over the matter. The Minister for Education and Science is a patient man to have remained in the portfolio considering the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have stated opinions which contradict his. I can only describe the Taoiseach's comments as slightly wishy-washy,  although people did not react as strongly to them as one might have expected because the Nice referendum was going through at the time. There are anomalies, and certainly no clarity, in what the Taoiseach has said about third level registration charges. The Tánaiste, however, has clearly stated her party's outright opposition to the reintroduction of third levels fees. That apparently contradictory position needs to be clarified. There is a constitutional provision with regard to collective Cabinet responsibility but it does not appear to have operated in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The 69% increase in registration fees was introduced in August when many students were away working to provide funds for their return to college this autumn. No consultation took place with student bodies before the registration fee was increased. Interestingly, I carried out a search on the Department of Education and Science's website today but I could not find anything about the fee increase. I was able to find information on the website concerning events in County Meath relating to other Departments, but nothing about this matter.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_801">Certainly. The registration fee increase was so substantial that it has effectively ended free third level education. Students contacted me during the summer to say they were finding it difficult to return to third level education because of the increase. The additional €700 broadly represents the sum students received on the summer jobs scheme, so they have spent 200 hours working to pay for the registration fee increase. The idea behind the summer jobs scheme, however, was to help students with their daily living expenses in term time.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">How much did the registration fee increase raise and on what exactly was it spent? I am aware the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party went to Killarney before the Dáil resumed but it did not discuss the issue there. I took part in a discussion on local radio with a Fianna Fáil Deputy who told me the registration fee increase was being used to provide learning support for teachers. He said I surely could not be against that. I have no difficulty with the provision of learning support for teachers but the money to provide it should not be raised on the backs of third level students and their parents. The Minister should explain how this money is being spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The increase in registration charges has caused genuine financial hardship for students and their families. It was a bombshell coming just before the leaving certificate results because parents had not expected to have to shell out such an increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The proposed reintroduction of third level fees is a form of cutback, which amounts to a regressive and short-sighted measure. Does the Minister  see education as a right only at primary level or at second level? Is it not a right at third level as well? The Minister's attitude seems to be that once students complete second level they have had enough help and should find their own way forward from there. That is a very short-sighted attitude because our economy has changed. There was a time when the leaving certificate was a passport to a good job, but that is no longer the case. Employers are seeking more highly qualified people now and we must be in a position to provide such a young, well-educated workforce. While we have been successful in doing so to date, the reintroduction of third level fees is a backward step.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">In his speech, the Minister admitted the high earning potential of graduates, yet he seems to think that is unfair. The Minister should note that the more people earn the more they will pay in tax. By investing in such people we are investing in the country's long-term prosperity because they will contribute higher tax levels. We must consider that more than 90% of third level students obtain employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">In September 2000, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, established a task force to advise on the most effective ways of increasing participation by disadvantaged groups at third level, including students with disabilities from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second-chance students. The excellent report of the task force made 78 recommendations but very few of them have been implemented. We now have another report but what happened to the earlier one? Why has the Department not proceeded to implement the report in full? Large amounts of money are being spent on reports that are largely ignored because when a new Minister takes office he decides it is irrelevant and commissions another report. This is tantamount to turning in circles. It is not the way to do business and is certainly a waste of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The programme for Government did not mention the reintroduction of third level fees. I checked the Fianna Fáil manifesto which contained scarcely any recommendations in relation to third level education.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_811">That is it. The Minister has not put forward any real proposals, either in this debate or in any of his kite-flying exercises, except his idea that increasing fees will fund greater access.  How can anyone accept that proposal now? Increasing access to third level education for the under-privileged and disadvantaged is a laudable aim in which we all believe. This side of the House still believes in the just society, but instead of raising the participation levels of the disadvantaged, the Minister is trying to pull down advantaged people, if one can so describe them, all the time. That is not the way to do business. We should be trying to help these people instead of trying to bring them down.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The Minster has underestimated the cost of attending third level education. I come from a county where there is no alternative for students but to leave home to attend college and, therefore, students from the midlands must pay for accommodation. A recent report entitled "Euro-Student 2000" showed that of nine EU countries studied, Ireland has the lowest availability of third level accommodation and is also the most expensive in the EU. Added to this is the cost of travel, books, day-to-day living and socialising, in which some people think students should not engage, although it is an important part of student life. These costs add up to between €5,000 and €7,500 per annum, but it costs a parent significantly more to earn that amount of money. That is just the cost of paying for the child attending college and does not include registration fees. How much will it be if we add registration fees? If one has more than one child in college or if one has two or three children, most of one's income could be gone on third level fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">This brings me back to the disadvantaged. The Minister's commitment, which he expressed on his first day here as Minister for Education and Science, is questionable. He cut €5 million from programmes to attract socio-economically disadvantaged school leavers to third level and €6 million from planned initiatives to reduce the school dropout rate, and now we are told he plans putting more money into similar initiatives. Disadvantage does not begin on the morning you wake up and get your leaving certificate results. It begins practically on the day you are born. If there is not the wherewithal at primary level and at second level and if there is not the ambition within a household to encourage children to go to third level, they are not going to suddenly wake up on 15 or 16 August and decide they cannot afford it. It is a far broader issue. That is why it needs to be examined and why the existing report, with its 78 recommendations, should be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">There is a need for far greater parental support, career guidance and college familiarisation programmes. We must look at other options for entry, some of which the Minister mentioned in his speech, which I welcome but which need to be expanded upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, must say who he considers to be wealthy. Certainly, many  people from the PAYE sector have been in touch with me saying they are not wealthy but are very concerned they will be hit. Who exactly does he propose to include in this? No one believes genuinely if it comes in this year at one level, that it will not come in at another level next year and at a further level the following year. That is a biggest fear abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The Government squandered the wealth for what one could call five fabulous years of a spending boom and it is now desperately attempting to bring that money back through the re-introduction of college fees. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, looks at third level students as a cash cow and at this as a way of bringing in the cutbacks which he needs from the Department of Education and Science. Unlike the Minister for Finance, parents of students actually have to budget and they need to know what they have to pay for in advance. I ask the Minister to come clean and clarify the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">The nub of the motion is why the Minister for Education and Science increased fees to higher education colleges by 69% during the summer. He did so because of cutbacks in his Department. He did it during the summer, knowing that many students would not be aware of it and hoping he would get away with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Fees were abolished in 1992 and a small fee for registration of €190 was introduced in 1996. This Government has increased those fees by 250% in the intervening six years. In 1990, the higher education grant for a student was €1,743. In the intervening 12 year period, that grant has been increased by 40% and yet the Government feels justified in increasing fees by 250% in a six year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">In 1990, the income limit at which one qualified for a third level grant stood at €14,000. In the 12 year period the Government increased the levels at which one could qualify for a higher education grant by 100%, but they increased the registration fees by 250%, clawing back money from people's pockets. That is a phenomenal increase by any standards and one wonders how it can be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">One must also consider how the costs of sending students to college have increased since 1990, including changes in the cost of rented accommodation and the cost of living. If a student is lucky enough to qualify for a full higher education grant at present, he or she will get €2,500, which amounts to about €70 per week. What will you get with €70 per week? My son is in higher education in Dublin at present and his accommodation, which is fairly basic, costs me – not him – per week. In addition, he has to have a few  bob in his pocket. I am on a good salary and I can afford to keep him at college, but can the Minister imagine the position of somebody earning €15,000, which is not a lot of money? They will get a grant of €70 a week, but how does a family on that income give the student the necessary top-up to enable him or her to attend college? I am amazed at how people do it and at the sacrifices which many parents make to do it. We should be helping those people and coming to their aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Another ridiculous anomaly within the higher education grants system is that if one has a second child at college, the applicable increase in the income limit for qualification is €2,500. We should live in the real world. How will an additional €2,500 help towards getting a student to college? It is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The Minister spent a great deal of time talking about the top-up grants available to disadvantaged students and how they could get this additional grant aid. I welcome that grant aid and think this is a great move, but it is almost impossible to qualify for it. Last year one had to be on social welfare levels of income to qualify, in other words, if you were earning more than £7,400 you did not qualify for the additional top-up. The Minister stated he has increased that amount by 30%. I was not aware of that and am delighted to hear it, but that will bring it to about £9,000 or some €11,000. What does the Minister mean by this? I wonder who on €11,000 is able to send a child to college, even with the top-up grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Deputy Burton spoke about the disadvantage some people experience in getting to college <i>vis-à-vis</i> others, say, in rural communities. In rural communities, students are severely disadvantaged because they must travel to college and, as Deputy Enright said, they must pay for accommodation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_825">I congratulate my colleague from Limerick, Deputy O'Sullivan, on her appointment as Labour Party spokesman on education and wish her every success. I know she will do a very good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">During the summer months free third level education was effectively abolished. A 69% increase in registration charges was surely the death-knell for free education at a time when the Higher Education Authority requested an increase of 7%. The authority was obviously seeking a high rate to enable them to get approval for a figure, somewhere between 4% and 5%, with which they would be happy, yet the Minister increased fees by 69%. This has sounded the death-knell to free education, has put many families and students under pressure and has created real hardship for PAYE workers on the margins of where these charges apply. It does not create a problem for those who are very highly paid, but it hits those on the margins very hard.  Students have had no choice but to decide not to go into third level education as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Education has changed this country more than anything else. Our affluent society, the Celtic tiger and the success of our economy have largely to do with an educational facility which has developed over a period of years. There are difficulties with it and these have been raised, but cutbacks are surely not the way to go. Our future lies in education, particularly in introducing the recommendations of the action group on access to third level education and in addressing education for those with a disability and for the disadvantaged and second chance students. These are the areas which should be developed but to which the Minister has not applied resources. We know of areas of our cities where only 1% or 2% of people will receive third level education. This is where we should invest in education. Cuts in any area of education are regrettable but a cut in third level education is an especially backward step.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a thabhairt duit as ucht deis a thabhairt dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a thógáil ar Dhíospóireacht an Athló tráthnóna. Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil an tAire é féin i láthair chun éisteacht lena bhfuil le rá agam agus, tá súil agam, chun freagraí a thabhairt a mbeidh suim ag muintir na Gaeltachta iontu.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Tá an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair ar bun le 30 bliain agus is ceann de na seoda is lonraí é i gcoróin Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhíomar uilig bródúil as an eastát sin agus as na postanna a bhí ann. Bhí beagnach 1,500 duine ag obair ar an eastát nuair a bhí sé i mbarr a réime ach, ar an drochuair, tá rudaí ag dul chun donais le cúpla bliain anuas. Dé hAoine seo caite, nuair a bhí féile mhór an Oireachtais ar siúl i nGaoth Dobhair agus an tAire é féin ansin, tháinig scéala eile ó Sioen Ireland, nó Gairméidí Caomhnaithe mar a thugaimid air i dTír Chonaill, go raibh an mhonarcha sin ag cailleadh 50 post. Ní rud úr é seo mar le gach mí le bliain anuas bhí fógra den chineál sin ag teacht ó mhonarcha éigin ar an eastát i nGaoth Dóbhair.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Dhá bhliain ó shin bhí 1,500 ag obair ar an eastát agus le dhá bhliain anuas tá idir 450 agus 500 post caillte ann. Is uafásach an uimhir í sin i gceantar Gaeltachta in iar-dheisceart Dhún na nGall. Lena chois sin tá idir 350 agus 400 duine i monarchana eile atá ar sheachtain ghiorraithe dhá nó trí lá. Tá na daoine sin íontach amhrasach cad é atá i ndán dóibh ins na blianta atá amach rom hainn. Tá tionscal atá ann le 30 bliain a bhfuil beagnach 200 duine ag obair ann agus atá ar sheachtain ghiorraithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Ní haon áibhéil nó bréag a rá go bhfuil géarchéim dí-fhostaíochta sa cheantar agus chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair ach go háirithe. Tá an eastát tar éis titim anuas go timpeall 900 ó 1,400.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Níl sé sin ag tarlú i nGaoth Dóbhair amháin ach ar an Fhál Carrach i bparóiste Chloch Cheann Fhaoile chomh maith. Bhí 150 ag obair cúpla bliain ó shin ach d'imigh an comhlucht agus níl ach scór nó dhó fostaithe sa chomhlucht a tháinig isteach ann. Tá réamh-mhonarcha i nGort an Choirce le 20 bliain gan oiread agus post amháin istigh ann. Ar na Rosann tá Aramara Teoranta agus i gCroithlí tá Nuvotem Teoranta ar sheachtain ghiorraithe trí lá.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Tá fadhb mhór dí-fhostaíochta sa cheantar agus ba mhaith liom go ndíreodh an tAire agus an t-údarás a n-aire ar an fhadhb seo. Caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh láithreach mar tá éadóchas mór i measc an phobail.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Bhí an tAire é féin sa cheantar ag an deireadh seachtaine agus chonaic sé spiorad na ndaoine. Tá an teanga agus an cultúr láidir ach muna gcuirtear fostaíocht ar fáil cad é an mhaitheas é sin mar ní fhanfaidh na daoine ins an bhaile.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Caithfidh an t-údarás gach dícheall monarcha nó tionscail nua-aimseartha agus nua-theicneolaíochta a mhealladh isteach go dtí an cheantar Gaeltachta sin. Tá daoine óga ansin a bhfuil scileanna acu a d'fhoghlaim siad ins na coláistí teicneolaíochta i Leitir Ceanainn agus i Sligeach ach tá siad ag fágail an chondae agus ag fágáil na Gaeltachta. Bíonn scaifte mhór againn ag an deireadh seachtaine ach oíche Dhomhnaigh bíonn orthu an Ghaeltachta a fhágáil agus dul go háiteanna eile fán tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Caithfidh an t-údarás beart cinnte a dhéanamh le postanna úra a mhealladh isteach sa cheantar, na postanna atá ansin a chosaint agus a chaomhnú agus aire ar leith a thabhairt do na daoine atá ag cailleadh a gcuid postanna agus an Nollaig buailte linn. Tá daoine ann atá os cionn teaghlaigh, gan teacht isteach eile acu agus a bhfuil morgáistí agus freagrachtaí oideachais a dteaghlaigh acu. Cad é atá i ndán do na daoine sin muna féidir linn postanna úra a chur in áit na bpostanna atá caillte le dhá bhliain anuas.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">Ba bhuille mór é an scéal a fógraíodh an tseachtain seo caite go raibh 50 duine á ligint chun siúil i mhonarcha ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair ag Gairméidí Chaomhnaite (Dún na nGall) Teoranta, nó Sioen Ireland mar a tugtar air.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Ceadaíodh cúnamh don chéad uair don chomhlacht seo breis is 20 bliain ó shin agus tá fostaíocht curtha ar fáil aige go leanúnach ó shin. Ar feadh tamaill freisin bhí an comhlacht ag feidhmiú ar eastát an Fhál Carraigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Tuigim go raibh an comhlacht ag obair ar am gairid, trí lá sa tseachtain, le mí anuas agus go bhfuil an fhostaíocht á laghdú go tuairim is 35, nó mar sin de, anois. Nuair a chuimhnítear go raibh os cionn 100 duine fostaithe ag an gcomhlacht seo i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill tamall ó shin, tuigimid chomh mór is atá an díomá ar laghdú seo i líon na bhfostaithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Is cuid é Gairméidí Caomhnaithe (Dún na nGall) Teoranta den Ghrúpa Sioen, an príomhtháirgeoir Eorpach do ghairméidí caomhnaithe, nó cosanta, do lucht oibre. Macasamhail tionscail éadaí eile, tá brú mór san earnáil seo le blianta beaga anuas ó thíortha ísealchostais.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Tá súil ag an gcomhlacht tabhairt faoin dúshlán idirnáisiúnta anois ar bhonn an athstruchtúraithe atá déanta aige le gairid ar a ghnó i nGaoth Dobhair. Beidh an comhlacht ag díriú ar tháirgí dúchasacha a fhorbairt sa mhonarcha sin, go háirithe casóga tarrthála agus réimse buataisí iascaireachta, chomh maith le dáileadh ilréimse gairméidí Ghrúpa Sioen in Éirinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Tagaim go hiomlán leis an Teachta go bhfuil ceantar Ghaoth Dobhair buailte go dona le gairid, gan dearmad a dhéanamh ar dhúnadh chomhlacht Nuvotem i gCroithlí. Is glan-laghdú é seo de thuairim is 300 le cúpla bliain anuas, in ainneoin breis agus 100 post nua a bheith cruthaithe sa tréimhse sin. Chomh maith leis sin tá breis is 300 de na fostaithe ar an eastát ar sheachtain oibre ghearr. Is údar imní agus buartha é seo don údarás agus pléadh na fadhbanna seo ag a chruinniú i nGaoth Dobhair Dé hAoine seo caite. Deimhníodh go ndéanfaí gach dícheall ar fhostaíocht eile atá fós ann a chaomhnú agus tuilleadh fostaíochta a chruthú.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Bhunaigh an t-iar Aire Stáit, Máire Ní Chochláin, grúpa oibre idir-áisínteacht roinnt mí ó shin. Is d'fhonn na polasaithe atá riachtanach chun deiseanna fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a scrúdú a bunaíodh an grúpa oibre sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Seo an t-aon bhealach atá ag an Stát le díriú ar na fadhbanna seo.

          <p eId="para_846">Ag éirí as moltaí an ghrúpa oibre agus ag cur leis na tosaíochtaí atá glactha ag an údarás cheana féin tá me dóchasach go mbeifear in ann deiseanna fiúntacha a chur ar fáil. Beifear ag díriú ar réimsí nua-aimseartha fostaíochta le béim níos mó ar ardscileanna agus ar acmhainní dúchasa na Gaeltachta, an Ghaeilge san áireamh, agus beimid ag béimiú go mór ar an nGaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Tá dul chun cinn maith déanta le tamall maidir le tograí nua a aimsiú do cheantar Ghaoth Dobhair.

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Colombia Three.</heading>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I am grateful for the opportunity of raising the case of the Colombia three, namely, Niall Connolly, Martin McCauley and Jim Monaghan, three Irish citizens who were arrested on 11 August 2001 at Bogota airport in Colombia.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">This is a human rights case which also has the potential to be a miscarriage of justice. It may not be trendy, fashionable or politically correct these days to speak out on human rights issues or the right to a fair trial, but I will do so because, in any democracy, if we stay silent on human rights abuses we fail as democrats and we fail as politicians that support civil liberties for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I appeal for balanced coverage of this debate in the media. Sadly, the media coverage and the political debate on the Colombia three has been unprofessional and showed a complete lack of fairness. I spent the past seven weeks meeting and talking with the families of the three men. I have been impressed by their sincerity, integrity and genuine compassion. They are concerned about the men's safety and also about getting them a fair trial in December. This is why I am speaking in this debate. I urgently request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to send a legal representative to the trial in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">It is essential that justice is seen to be done. It is also essential that Ireland asserts itself as an opinion maker on human rights cases and that it is not bullied or influenced too much by the  United States or Britain. It is also the duty of elected representatives to inform the public about the real facts and background to the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Colombia has a population of 42.2 million people, whose official language is Spanish, but there are also 180 other languages. Over 3 million people have been displaced by violence over a ten year period. About 200,000 had to flee in the first six months of 2001 alone. In October 1998, President Pastrana created a demilitarised area which comprised 40% of Colombia. The thinking was to create a space to facilitate talks with the FARC guerrillas and to have a physical space for conflict resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Historically, it is important that we record that in 1984 the FARC movement called a ceasefire and was about to go down the political road. However, over 4,000 of its members, men and women, many of whom were candidates for the election, were slaughtered by right-wing paramilitary groups with links to the security forces. This led to the breakdown of the ceasefire and the civil war started again. On 9 July 1998, President elect Andrés Pastrana met FARC leaders and dialogue began again.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">It is also important to put on record that the area the three men visited was also visited by Mo Mowlam and the Queen of Jordan. These are the basic facts of the background to this case and it is important that the public knows this.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">In the so-called Plan Colombia, one can see clearly that 75% of the assistance is for military expenditure. There is barely a mention of the poor farmers or workers who work for as little as 50 cent per hour. Only the coca plants in the guerrilla-controlled areas are being fumigated. This is only a small percentage of the Colombian coca production. Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reports that 80% of the production is coming from other areas. These chemicals are also killing legal crops such as coffee, rubber and bananas. Farmers are being forced back to coca production. Let us put proper investment in these areas and give the poor an opportunity to break the cycle of poverty. This is where we should invest our Third World funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">In 2001, 144 trade Unionists were assassinated and 66 disappeared. The UN estimates that one woman disappears every 14 days and one is killed every 50 days. Also, in 2001, 12 journalists were killed, eight fled the country and 24 were kidnapped. It is essential that we all know the background to this case. Since their arrests, the three men have been tried by the Colombian and international media, which violates their right to a fair trial. The Colombian Office of the Attorney General has deliberately leaked every prosecution document to the media. Despite all the hype, there is no forensic evidence against the men. International, independent experts will confirm this in December. Witnesses have been dis credited and the only case is false documentation. This charge, in any part of the world, would simply mean deportation.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">This is the background to the case of the Colombia three and I urge the Minister to do all in his power to assist the families in their requests for support, legal advice, financial advice, national and international observers and, above all, to ensure a fair trial for the three men. I urge the Minister to take these proposals and issues on board.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_861">I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The three Irish men to whom the Deputy refers were arrested at Bogota airport by military police on 11 August 2001. They are currently being held in La Modelo prison in Bogota. The men have been charged with the use of false documents and training for illicit activities. The judicial authority handling the case ruled that the men had a case to answer and authorised their detention while an investigation was carried out. In February this year, the decision was taken that there were sufficient grounds to send the matter to trial and the men were formally charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The Department of Foreign Affairs has provided consular assistance to the three men since their arrest. Officials from the embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia on a non-resident basis, have made frequent consular visits to the men. The embassy has also maintained close contact with the relevant Colombian authorities and has assisted the families and the organisation supporting the men who have visited them on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, wrote twice to his Colombian counterpart to stress the importance of ensuring that the men are held in a place where their safety can be assured, where they can be given reasonable living conditions and where they can have adequate access to their legal representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The Minister met the Colombian Foreign Minister in New York in September 2001 to reiterate these concerns. The Taoiseach met former President Pastrana in June of this year and emphasised the importance of ensuring that the men receive a fair trial. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach have met the families of the men. The Minister also met the new Colombian Foreign Minister in New York on 13 September and had a further meeting with the families of the three men on 26 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The date for the opening of the men's trial was set for 4 October in Bogota. However, the men refused to attend the first hearing, claiming that they could not receive a fair trial and, as a consequence, the trial was postponed by the judge until 16 October. On that occasion also the men  exercised their right not to attend but the judge proceeded with the case in their absence. He made certain decisions in respect of future proceedings and set the dates of 2 to 4 December for the next stage of the trial. It is expected that the trial will take place in a number of stages over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">An official from the Irish embassy accredited to Colombia attended the two hearings to date as a consular observer. The Minister has received a request to also send a legal observer to attend the next stages of the trial. The Minister will make a decision on this request in due course, in light of an assessment of all aspects of the issue. This has been conveyed to the families of the men.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The Minister wishes to assure the House that his Department will continue to closely follow this case and that it will provide all possible consular assistance to the men and their families.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">Deputy Hogan also raised a matter, the need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to review the regulatory environment in which the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland operates with a view to ensuring established and properly licensed community radio stations can continue to operate.

          <p eId="para_871">I raise this issue to reflect the outrage expressed by the people of Kilkenny city and county in relation to the broadcasting licence application to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland by Kilkenny Community Radio Limited. A public meeting was held to address the issue, attended by almost 2,000 people who expressed their outrage that Kilkenny Community Radio Limited should be left without a licence and asked to close its doors next October. The radio station is a wholly owned community station and expresses the views of the community in every aspect of its work and all its broadcasting programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The station comprises 2,800 shareholders, all of whom reflect community ownership, has 21 employees and a high listnership, reflected in various JNLR surveys. For example, yesterday it achieved a 63% listnership rate. Overall, it achieves a 81% weekly listnership rate. It has only been outclassed in the league by Highland Radio, Donegal. It is a successful model in terms of community radio stations and has a very sup portive customer base. Most businesses, not only in Kilkenny, but also some outside the county, use the station to advertise their products.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">There appear to be flaws in the legislation that would allow a successful radio station of this kind, existing over 13 years, to apply for a renewal of its licence, admittedly to cover a different franchise area of counties Kilkenny and Carlow, and have it displaced by the granting of a licence to a wholly commercial operator. Having during the years built up its intangible assets of a good advertising and listnership base, the station would command a value of millions of euro in the open market. The goodwill alone would increase that value, yet the station is being asked to close down without any reflection on the value it has created for the local community. In view of this, there is a lesson to be learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I ask the Minister to review the legislation to ensure that in the future community radio stations as successful as Kilkenny Community Radio Limited are not overlooked by the BCI. I also ask him to consider the possibility of having a licence issued to a community radio station for the franchise area of Kilkenny city and county, established in the listnership profile built up by Kilkenny Community Radio Limited over the past 13 years. The station's licence submission to the BCI indicated that the franchise area of counties Carlow and Kilkenny was structured in such a way to ensure it could provide a proper community radio service for both counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The reasons for refusal of the licence by the BCI are questionable. It states it has reservations about the community structure, but no other community radio station in the country could compete with the structure laid down by Kilkenny Community Radio Limited. It stated there was a lack of representation on the board from County Carlow. That is not the case because, if granted the licence, the new radio station would have reflected a proper membership from counties Carlow and Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">At a time when pillars of the community in both church and State have crumbled we should make every effort to ensure the Minister responsible for community development should take note of what is happening in terms of local radio stations. This wholly owned community station cannot be ignored. In drawing the Minister's attention to the issue I ask him to facilitate the relevant Oireachtas committee in bringing before it the BCI and Kilkenny Community Radio Limited to discuss what has happened in this case and realistically consider the issuing of a separate licence, if necessary, to create competition in this area.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_879">I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important local matter in the House. It concerns the franchise area granted by the former Independent Radio and Television Commission to Radio Kilkenny, under the auspices of Kilkenny Community Radio Limited. The station has a high listnership with 2,800 shareholders and over 20 staff, all of them very dedicated to the well being of this highly successful radio station.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Everybody was surprised at the decision on the awarding of the licence by the BCI, established by statute in 2000, even if the application was to cover a wider area to include counties Carlow and Kilkenny. The shock at the decision was reflected at the large public meeting held in Kilkenny to address the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">I am disappointed that when the legislation was passing through the Oireachtas in December 2000, the Government did not listen carefully to the proposals made by the Opposition. My colleague, former Deputy Clune, who I introduced to the then chief executive of Kilkenny Community Radio Limited, Dermot Healy, proposed an amendment to ensure the investment of a Kilkenny radio licence holder, such as Kilkenny Community Radio Limited, would be recognised for a further five years if it met the criteria laid down by the BCI. Doubtless, Radio Kilkenny would have done so. This would have allowed the community broadcasting network established by Radio Kilkenny to continue to function in a professional manner. The then Minister, Deputy de Valera, and all Government Deputies voted against the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The legislation needs to be amended to allow, not only those in the Radio Kilkenny franchise area, but also throughout the country, who have in a community way built up their community listnership and shareholding, to function for an additional five years. While I do not believe licences should be granted in perpetuity, those involved in community radio should be given greater opportunities. The status of the BCI needs to be clarified by the Minister. He must indicate if Radio Kilkenny and all other applicants met the criteria and explain the reason the Radio Kilkenny franchise application was not successful.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusPattison" eId="spk_416" as="#Ceann_Comhairle">
          <from>Mr. Pattison</from>
          <p eId="para_883">I thank Deputy Hogan for sharing his time. An Adjournment debate is inadequate for a subject of this magnitude because this issue has major ramifications, not only for County Kilkenny and surrounding counties, but also countrywide. The entire country would be affected. As has been said, in Kilkenny we have a highly successful and popular local radio. It is a truly genuine community radio, community based and community driven. It is not merely unsatisfactory but disastrous that the licence can be taken away from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">This scenario was foreseen, as Deputy Hogan said, when the legislation was going through this House. Deputy Brian O'Shea, a Labour Deputy representing Waterford, who was the party spokesperson on this area at the time, foresaw this kind of difficulty and repeatedly appealed to the Minister to accept an amendment that would have prevented the licence being taken in this manner. Deputy Michael D. Higgins also made a very passionate speech in favour of the amendment, also to no avail.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">I call on the Government to take whatever action is necessary to ensure Radio Kilkenny keeps its licence. After all, it is the Government who insisted that the present legislation be there in spite of the appeals made against it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_886">I have two replies, one for Deputy McGuinness and one for Deputy Hogan. They are more or less the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Under the Radio and Television Act, 1988, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, which is a statutorily independent body, has responsibility for licensing local radio services. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has no function in regard to the licensing of such services. At the level of local radio, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland licences two different types of services. Firstly, the commission licences local commercial services which are most commonly licensed on the basis of a franchise area covering a single county or two neighbouring counties. Secondly, the commission licences local community services catering for smaller communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">At present, 13 community radio services are licensed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I understand the commission intends inviting expressions of interest later this year or early next year from parties interested in establishing new community radio services. The commission is supportive of groups interested in establishing community radio services and it often assists such groups in planning for the development of a new service. Ultimately however, the future of community radio services will be decided by local communities themselves. Community radio services grow from the ideas, enthusiasm and efforts of individuals and groups at community level.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Deputy McGuinness referred to a recent announcement by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and suggested that the future of community radio needs to be considered in the context of that announcement. As the commission has not in fact made a recent announcement in regard to community radio services I assume he is referring to recent announcements by the commission in regard to the licensing of local commercial radio services. One such announcement related to a new commercial local radio service serving Carlow and Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">In November of last year the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland invited expressions of interest from parties interested in providing local commercial radio services. In January of this year the commission decided to make a number of changes to the existing local radio franchise areas. One of the changes made was to introduce a new franchise area of Carlow-Kilkenny. The commission invited applications for the licence of the new franchise area of Carlow-Kilkenny in March of this year and made a decision in October last. I understand that Radio Kilkenny which holds the current licence for County Kilkenny applied for the licence for the new franchise but was not successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Licensing of local radio services is obviously a very sensitive matter. This House has taken the view that licensing decisions should be made by an independent statutory body and has passed legislation entrusting that responsibility to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Licensing decisions become particularly sensitive in circumstances where an existing local radio station fails in competition to have its licence renewed. This occurred recently in a number of cases. In these cases the existing local radio stations took part in a competition for a new licence but were unsuccessful.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The only reasonable analysis of what happened in these cases is that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland took the view that the successful applicants best met the criteria for the award of new licences. I do not believe that the decision of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in these cases should be interpreted in any way as a criticism of existing licence holders. Going forward, I expect the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will have many more hard decisions to make. The interest of the people is likely to be best served, however, if there are a number of competent competing parties seeking each local radio licence. Healthy competition is a good thing. The alternative would be to renew licences in perpetuity and to never re-define franchise areas. This would avoid hard decisions and controversy but would obviously not be in the public interest.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_894">As I have already outlined in the previous debate this evening, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, which is a statutorily independent body, has responsibility for licensing local radio services. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has no function in regard to the licensing of such services. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland's responsibilities in this mater are provided for in the Radio and Television Act, 1988. The commission has the power to licence local commercial  radio services along with local community radio services.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Deputy Hogan raised the question of whether there is a need to review the regulatory environment in which the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland operates with a view to ensuring that an established community radio station can continue to operate. The answer to the question is the same regardless of whether Deputy Hogan was referring to a local commercial radio service or to a local community service.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">If the question is whether the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has the power to renew the licence of an existing radio service then the answer is quite clearly "Yes". If the question is if the commission can guarantee an existing licence holder that the licence will be renewed, then the answer is quite clearly "No".</p>
          <p eId="para_897">If Deputy Hogan is suggesting that the existing legislation be amended to provide each licence holder with a guaranteed renewal of their licence then I reject his suggestion. As I outlined earlier, I am strongly of the view that the interest of the people is likely to be best served where there is competition for local radio licences. Competition will act as an incentive to existing licence holders to provide a service of the highest quality. The past performance of the existing or previous licence holders is a factor which the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland must have regard to when making decisions on the award of a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Section 60 of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, requires the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland when considering the award of a local radio licence to have regard to the overall quality of the performance of the applicant with regard to any licence held by him before the date of making the application. This provision is included at the request and with the full agreement of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, the representative body for local independent radio stations. The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland were anxious to ensure specifically that the past performance of a local radio operator should be taken into account by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland when licences are re-advertised. In the past decade or so Ireland has witnessed the emergence of a strong local radio sector. This tremendous development and the high standards achieved should quite rightly be factored into future licensing decisions. The provision in the 2001 Act does this in a balanced and proportionate manner. There is no automatic right of licence renewal but instead a guarantee that past performances will be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I do not believe that the circumstances referred to by the Deputy merits any legislative change. One of two sets of circumstances must pertain. The first option would be that licences would always be automatically renewed once the holder has operated the radio service to a certain minimum standard. The second option is that at  reasonable intervals there should be a competition to determine who will hold the licence going forward. In the first scenario the interests of the licence holder would be paramount while the second reflects the existing regulatory environment. Here the interest of the public is paramount which is the critical factor that should inform this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">In legal terms, licensing local radio services is about granting a licence to one radio station as  opposed to another. In practice it is about granting a right to a radio station to use a limited scarce resource – radio spectrum – to provide service to the public. Regulations should be designed to best serve the public interest. I am strongly of the view that is best served where there is competition for licences at regular intervals.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 November 2002.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_912">I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 75, 76, 80, 87, 104, 107, 161 and 169 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">As the House is no doubt aware, the board of IFI decided on 15 October that, in the light of the financial position in which it found itself, the company would have to cease trading and that it was recommending to the shareholders that a liquidator be appointed. The board took this decision after both shareholders indicated that they were not in a position to continue supporting the company in the absence of a realistic viability plan. Unfortunately, the company was not able to produce such a plan and, instead, sought funding of €10 million to support a short-term survival plan. Even then, the board accepted that the level of funding sought might prove inadequate. The shareholders were concerned that even relatively small setbacks to the plan in the short term would inevitably result in further requests for support and could not see a basis for further injections to the company.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_28">The winding down of the business has been taking place in the period since the board's decision. I pay tribute to the professionalism of those who have been actively engaged in decommissioning the company's plants in a responsible, safe and orderly manner. The workforce is to be admired and congratulated for this responsible attitude. The board of IFI has called a creditors' meeting for Friday, 8 November and it is expected that a liquidator will be appointed then. The roles and responsibilities of the liquidator are well established in company law. Essentially, they  are to realise the assets of the company in an efficient and effective manner with a view to satisfying the company's debts to the maximum extent possible. The future of the various plants, therefore, will depend on the outcome of the liquidator's efforts to maximise the value of the assets. The board will present a statement of affairs at the creditors' meeting and this will give a clearer picture of the position of all creditors, though the actual position can only be determined with certainty when the assets of the company are realised.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">While neither the Government nor ICI, the other shareholder in the company, considers it appropriate to give letters of comfort to creditors, both believe that an orderly wind-down and liquidation is in everybody's interest. In this regard, the shareholders have agreed, even though there is no legal obligation to do so, to provide a sum of nearly €24.5 million to coverex gratia redundancy payments to workers. When combined with statutory entitlements, payable by the liquidator, a total of nearly €32 million will be available which should be enough to provide an average payment of over €50,000 per worker, a sum which is considered fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The exact terms for the distribution of the funds will be determined following discussions between the workers' representatives and Mr. Ray Jackson, who is being appointed as sole trustee of the trust which is being used for this purpose. Both shareholders have agreed, in principle, to subordinate loans of €34 million to the company in favour of the other creditors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">I am happy to advise the House that the shareholders have responded favourably to a request from the IFI unions for interim payments to workers pending the determination of the basis for the allocation of the funds available. We are currently making arrangements which will facilitate payments amounting to the lower of €5,000 or three months pay. Without this initiative, the workers faced the prospect of severe cashflow difficulties within a very short period of time because the company was only in a position to pay wages due up to the date of the lay-off. It is likely to take a number of weeks to arrange payment of statutory entitlements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">There seems to be difficulties with the pension scheme for the Belfast employees. However, I understand that the position for the schemes covering most of the staff in the other locations may be somewhat better, though it is still too early to rule out problems. It is obviously a matter of extreme concern that employees' pension entitlements may not be met by their pension funds. However, I understand that the company has been meeting its obligations to the various schemes and that the difficulties stem mainly from adverse stock market movements, rather than from any default on the part of the company. It should be noted that the recent stock market developments would have had a significant adverse impact on virtually all pension funds.  Pensions issues are, by their very nature, very complicated and the trustees of the various schemes will have to establish the full facts for each of the schemes and consider the range of options available to minimise the shortfalls involved. This would presumably include seeking to maximise any possible recoveries from the liquidator or other parties. I expect that it will take some time for the various issues to be clarified.</summary>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_916">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 121 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The issue of job creation through the attraction of foreign direct investment is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland, for which it is a day to day operational issue. At the beginning of 2001, it was clear that the year was going to be very different to the previous ones, in terms of IDA Ireland's work in foreign direct investment markets. Global circumstances, particularly in the dotcom and information technology sectors, had changed investor mood considerably. International business confidence ebbed as 2001 progressed and the awful events of 11 September in the United States added to concerns. This exceptional set of circumstances resulted in one of IDA Ireland's toughest years. Overall, the value of non-IFSC foreign direct investment inflows into Ireland in 2001 measured €8.2 billion, down from €11.4 billion in 2000, as quoted in the 2002 world investment report 2002, Transnational Corporations and Export Competitiveness, published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_32">The global economic slowdown, especially in information technology, impacted on the agency's 2001 results and it ended the year with a small net loss of 2.8% in IDA Ireland assisted jobs in overseas companies, the first such loss in 15 years, despite a positive performance in other sectors. This was acknowledged in the agency's annual report and accounts for 2001. In absolute terms, however, the number of jobs created in 2001 was still very high at 13,514, higher than every year prior to 1997. The period from 1992 to 2001, inclusive, saw increases of almost 44% in the  number of foreign direct investment companies operating in Ireland, and over 75% in permanent employment in these companies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33">Ireland's recent economic success has changed its profile as a location for investment. IDA Ireland is now competing for a different type of business to the labour intensive manufacturing which it won over the past four decades when Ireland was largely a low cost location. Basic operative skills are now available at lower costs throughout the developing world. Improving communications facilitate businesses to locate parts of their value chains in distant locations. Ireland's future success will be dependent on our ability to achieve an environment where research and knowledge, high level skills and expertise, high quality infrastructure and business services, are combined in that flexible and creative way which is almost uniquely Irish. Foreign direct investment will feed into the future operating model and will be essential to our success, but it will be increasingly integrated and interwoven with Irish business which is itself ever more international.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34">The transformation to being driven by innovation will not be instant, but it will need to progress quickly so we are recognisably different by 2010. In the meantime, we need to continue winning foreign direct investment at higher value levels using some of the advantages and tools that have been so successful for us to date. IDA Ireland needs to continue its existing priority work first, with current clients to move them up the value chain; second, to achieve better regional balance in new investments; and, third, to influence improvements in infrastructure and skills. The objective must be to place Ireland at the leading edge of the global economy in some specific competencies or industry niches. It will mean not relying solely on an individual project focus, but adding the development of clusters of excellence in which technology companies, education and research activities, venture capital providers, business service providers, etc. network to create a climate of innovation and entrepreneurship.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35">I am confident that the measures outlined above which are currently being adopted by IDA Ireland, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring positive results to the country. I will continue, along with the industrial development agencies, to promote Ireland with international firms for suitable industrial development projects.</summary>

          <p eId="para_919">I have had this matter considered by my Department. I am satisfied that the pyramid selling legislation is not an appropriate model for dealing with this issue, nor would it be effective. This is not a consumer issue. No goods change hands. Gifting schemes are, in effect, a form of gambling although the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is of the view that they do not come within the definitions contained in current legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">In the circumstances, the best remedy is common sense. It is clear that some participants in such schemes inevitably lose their money. People are entitled to use their money as they please but, given the publicity that has attached to this issue, they cannot be in any doubt about the risk they are taking if they participate in these schemes.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_922">I am aware of statements regarding the mistreatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here on foot of work permit applications and I condemn the abuses of the workers concerned. I have put the few employers who engage in these practices on notice that I am determined that they will not succeed in ignoring their statutory obligations to any employee. Moreover, this minority of employers must be aware of the effect their actions have on Ireland's international image and the potential negative impact their behaviour has on our capacity to attract investment and necessary skills from abroad. In this regard, however, the fact that 40% of permits granted to date in 2002 are renewals is indicative of a growing level of stability and satisfaction in employer-employee relationships in this area and evidence that it is a limited number of employers that fall into the rogue category.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_36">The Deputy is aware that work permit legislation is planned and is currently with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. The legislation will make it an offence for a person to work here without a work permit, when a valid permit is a requirement for that individual, and it will also be an offence for an employer to employ someone in respect of whom a valid work permit is not in existence when such a permit is required. Stringent penalties are envisaged in respect of these offences. In addition, new powers of inspection, search and investigation are proposed. On an ongoing basis a more thorough regime of  checking of work permit applications is being implemented, including more cross-referencing of documentation. In the meantime, a policy is in operation whereby the processing of work permit applications for any employer is suspended when the Department becomes aware of any concerns regarding that employer's compliance with the obligations set out in the various employment rights enactments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring the employment conditions of the various categories of workers, including immigrant workers. In this regard, the inspectorate can pursue allegations of workers being subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions from pay, non-payment of compensation for Sunday working or of holiday or public holiday pay etc. If evidence of non-compliance with employment rights legislation is found, redress will be sought for individuals who have been mistreated and, if appropriate, a prosecution will be initiated. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality. It undertook just under 6,500 inspections in 2001 and ensured the payment of almost €520,000 in arrears of wages to employees. It referred 31 cases to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for prosecution in 2001, of which 26 cases were successfully concluded leading to 17 convictions and fines including, in most instances, the awarding of expenses and costs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">The inspectorate has undertaken more than 4,500 inspections this year, mainly dealing with issues arising from more than 1,000 case files and €325,130 has been obtained in arrears of wages for employees. Furthermore, 15 cases have been referred for legal proceedings leading to 13 convictions while two cases were withdrawn. A major project this year has been the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures. This new IT system will come on-line early next year and will be the result of considerable investment by my Department over two years. It will provide the technological support to enable inspectors to operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike while also improving the interaction with the enforcement side of the process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that our employment rights legislation, which establishes the statutory rights applicable to workers whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, applies to all people working in Ireland. The legislation makes no distinction whatever between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers and as such, all workers in Ireland, without exception, are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections. In other words, Irish employment rights apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner they do to native Irish workers. Statutory effect to this grounding principle was recently established in  section 21 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_924">When the PPF commenced in November 1999 there were 36,027 participants on the community employment scheme and 2,047 participants on the job initiative programme. At the beginning of 2002 there were 30,809 participants on the community employment scheme and the estimated year's end participation rate is 25,000. The corresponding figures for the job initiative programme are 2,762 and 2,600. There are currently 24,560 and 2,583 participants on the community employment and job initiative schemes respectively. Participation rates on the community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes next year will depend on the level of funding available for them in 2003. The Government's consideration of the Estimates provisions for 2003 is under way and is due to be concluded shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality, and co-ordinates reductions to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of community employment. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions in community employment and projects in RAPID areas and in the health services are given top priority. Community employment places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at the level of the start of the year to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_41">FÁS is undertaking an internal review of the community employment and job initiative schemes and the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment taking account  of the link with the provision of community services. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community employment, as will the outcome of Government consideration of the 2003 Estimates.</summary>

          <p eId="para_927">The state development agencies are fully committed to promoting employment creation in the Carlow area. The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and the importance of making even greater efforts in this field has been impressed on the development agencies. The agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Carlow County Development Board and Carlow County Council, as well as other local bodies and interests in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. Carlow is being targeted by IDA Ireland as a credible alternative to the major population centres of choice. IDA Ireland's focus will be on attracting international services and the newer technology businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Development works are well under way at the new 50-acre business and technology park on the Dublin Road. It is planned that these works will be completed by end of 2002, after which work can commence on the construction of the first building, which is expected to be completed in late summer 2003. The park will provide high specification office accommodation. Along with recent improvements in road access to Dublin Airport and the growing reputation of Carlow Institute of Technology graduates, the technology park will position Carlow to win additional inward investment. The strong growth sectors of software development and financial and customer services will be the main targets. In addition, IDA Ireland has recently agreed to sell its seven-acre industrial site to Carlow County Council in order to facilitate the provision of sites for manufacturing.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_934">Government policy in this regard is articulated through the strategies devised and executed by the development agencies. Enterprise Ireland's policy on the internationally traded services sector is based on ITS 2007, a major study of the sector commissioned by Enterprise Ireland in 1999. The report presents a range of specific initiatives to be undertaken by Enterprise Ireland aimed at developing high value-added, knowledge intensive industries and helping them to achieve fast growth. The strategy prioritises specific sub-segments for development. It is subject to ongoing review as this is a rapidly changing sector. The key elements of Enterprise Ireland's regional development strategy are developing the competitiveness and export potential of existing businesses in the regions; enhancing the operating environment for business; supporting an increased level of new high potential start-ups throughout the country; and identifying new opportunities for economic development in the region, including investments by expansion-minded Dublin-based companies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_42">The strategy covers the period between 2001 and 2003, but it is being continuously monitored and a major review will begin early next year. The regional and ITS strategies are linked by Webworks, a facility that will provide the environment to create and sustain the development of high-tech industries. The planning process has commenced for all four Webworks facilities in phase one, in Sligo, Galway, Waterford and Cork, and it is expected that construction will commence in 2003. Enterprise Ireland has also supported the development of technology hubs such as the  Galway Technology Centre and the National Software Centre in Cork.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_43">Foreign direct investment can also assist in regional development. Although the challenge of locating high-value FDI regional locations is considerable, progress is being made. For example, substantial software development activities have been attracted to Letterkenny and Mullingar, and financial services back offices have been attracted to Wexford, Kilkenny, Galway and Mullingar. With regard to the Shannon Development Company, high-tech internationally traded services are a key component of the agency's efforts to develop the Shannon region where the balance of activity has moved in favour of services, rather than manufacturing. This type of activity will remain a key focus of its efforts to attract and retain foreign direct investment in this sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_44">In terms of high-potential indigenous enterprise and the number of established technology hubs, Shannon Development has developed a number of initiatives, including the Shannon Development Knowledge Network, VentureStart and AlumniStart. The digital hub project aims to cluster research and development-based companies, both Irish and multinational, in the key growth field of digital media, in the Liberties and Coombe area of Dublin as part of the ongoing effort to make Ireland an international centre for high-tech research and cutting-edge digital industry. While the project is now well into its operational phase and draft legislation to put its management on a statutory footing is before the Oireachtas, I should point out that lead ministerial responsibility at Government level in this matter rests with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_45">On 25 October, I announced my proposals for fundamental insurance reform. The proposals reflect the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprise a comprehensive set of inter-related measures, designed to improve the functioning of the insurance market. The key measures include the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board; publication of an action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the personal injuries assessment board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the board on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB. While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, I have made it clear that I expect aquid pro quo from the industry in response to my reform programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_944">A total of 25,048 proposed redundancies were notified to my Department under the Redundancy Acts, 1967 to 1991, during the 12 months between 1 October 2001 and 30 September 2002. The information requested by the Deputy in relation to job creation this year is not yet available. This year's Forfás annual employment survey, which will be carried out in November, will give details of jobs created and lost in companies assisted by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and county enterprise boards between 1 November 2001 and 31 October 2002. The 2001 survey showed that total permanent full-time employment in companies under the remit of the industrial development agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta, amounted to 315,500 in 2001, a decline of 3,500 in comparison with the 2000 figure. While 30,000 jobs were created in 2001, these gains were offset by job losses of 33,500 during the same period.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_46">Just over 50% of jobs approved between 1992 and 2001 came from clients already located in Ireland, with the rest resulting from greenfield projects. Despite the downturn in 2001, the period as a whole showed a rise of almost 44% in the number of foreign direct investment companies operating in Ireland and an increase of over 75% in permanent employment. The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size  of the economy, is one of the highest in the world. The IDA will focus on increasing the contribution of investment from existing clients in the future. The prime requirements for foreign direct investment are that it is high-value added, requiring high skill levels; that it is, as far as possible, innovation rather than production orientated; and that it links to an increasingly sophisticated business environment. This new investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and seeking new emerging investors in existing or new activities and sectors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">Enterprise Ireland anticipates that increases in employment in the indigenous sector in 2002 will be weaker than 2001 and expects that job losses will be higher as companies continue to downsize. The agency will focus on maximising the number of sustainable job gains for 2002 through the creation of new jobs by entrepreneurs setting up new high-potential start-up companies; the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies; enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions; and supporting the capability and competitiveness building of companies. In the micro-enterprise sector, the 35 county and city enterprise boards will continue to provide dispersed economic development throughout the country, developing indigenous enterprise potential, stimulating economic activity at local level and promoting micro-enterprises. The boards provide a single point of contact at local level and complement the activities of the other industrial development agencies. They support individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">While any deterioration in job creation levels is disappointing, I believe that the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. I am confident that, given the commitment of the industrial development agencies, we can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms.</summary>

          <p eId="para_946">The report of the redundancy review group was published on 22 October. I am pleased that the group, which included representatives of employers, workers and Government Departments, reached agreement on a wide range of policy and administrative issues. In particular, the group reached agreement on the treatment of  older workers, insurability requirements, ceilings on wages, qualification periods, determination of weekly pay, non-reckonable service, employees working abroad, fines and penalties and links between redundancy and training. Administrative issues that were agreed include the rounding of years of service, forms used in the administration of the scheme and the need for a new computer system. The Government has agreed to proceed with the implementation of these changes and my Department will prepare the necessary legislation to give effect to them. We will also plan for the introduction of a new IT system, which will include an e-government capability. This will, I believe, greatly improve the efficiency and level of service offered by the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">Certain items were not agreed by the redundancy review group. These include the level of the redundancy ceiling, differentiation between those under and over 41 years, multiple of weekly pay, size of rebate to the employer and the provision of an enhanced statutory amount where employers fail or are unable to make statutory payments. The group has clarified the costs involved in these items, however, and the post-PPF negotiations which have commenced recently will benefit from the group's work in this regard and will be well informed regarding these costs.</p>

The ongoing drafting of the Bill deals with the concerns relating, for example, to auditor independence arising from Enron.

          <p eId="para_951">Irish Business Against Litter sponsored the building of a 28,000 sq. ft. advance manufacturing facility in 1998. The facility is located at the IDA business park in Dungarvan, County Waterford. IDA Ireland is responsible for property marketing in this area. The facility was designed to offer a large open production or manufacturing floor of 25,000 sq. ft. and a smaller office area of 3,000 sq. ft.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The facility is being actively marketed by the IDA's south east regional office, along with its property division based in Athlone, to new and existing foreign direct investment companies. There have been a number of meetings this year between IDA Ireland and Waterford County Council, involving the Waterford County Enterprise Board, concerning the marketing of the building. Full details of the building are available to the staff of the IDA, including their overseas network, on the IDA's property database. The starting point of a potential itinerary is to agree on the regions, cities or towns that the company will visit. Suitable property based on the company's requirements is shown as part of the itinerary.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The climate for inward investment has changed significantly since the building was designed and completed in 1998. Foreign direct investors now tend to be advanced manufacturing companies in the pharmaceuticals and health care sectors, or services companies. The property requirements of these companies tend to favour purpose-built developments. However, the IBAL facility continues to feature on the itineraries of all suitable companies and it remains an important part of the IDA south east region's property portfolio to attract inward investment to Dungarvan. There have been five site visits to the facility since January 2000 and nine site visits to Dungarvan in total during this period. The most recent visit was in September 2002 when a shared services facility visited the site. I am confident that the measures being adopted by IDA Ireland, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring positive results to Dungarvan.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 127 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. I have impressed on the industrial development agencies – IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards – the crucial importance of making greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country. The industrial development agencies work in conjunction with each other on the ground and through the county development board system.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">In 1999, IDA Ireland set a target of locating 50% of all new greenfield jobs in the Objective One region in the period to 2003. As part of this policy, the IDA is seeking to attract defined sectors into specific regions. This year, key operational units have been moved from Dublin to Waterford, Athlone and Sligo, to assist the development of these centres by helping them to develop as magnets of attraction or regional hubs. The IDA has developed a number of new business parks and office buildings to the best international standards to provide a range of property options for overseas investors. Such developments are generally in gateway, or institute of technology, towns with smaller developments in other centres. The designation of larger towns as regional hubs or growth centres should not hinder the development of smaller regional towns. On the contrary, smaller towns should benefit from the growth of larger centres. Some of the small towns are likely to attract companies in the subcontracting or service sectors providing goods and services to companies in the larger centres.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_50">On 18 September last, during an address to a conference at the Waterford Institute of Technology, the chief executive of IDA Ireland, Seán Dorgan, put into context the infrastructural and other requirements which regions must have to continue to attract high quality foreign direct investment projects. Regions must offer a distinctive reason to attract inward investment, as if competition is global, companies will demand world-class facilities. Frequently, they will choose  between options available in Ireland and in a number of other countries. Critical mass is required for the provision of world-class facilities. Ultimately, overseas investors will choose the most competitive locations which are best suited to their particular needs. We must continue to strive to offer the best possible location for high-level activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">Enterprise Ireland implements its regional development strategy based on a four pillar approach: to enhance the operating environment for business; to support an increased level of new high-potential start-ups throughout the country; to identify new opportunities for economic development in the regions, including investments by expansion-minded Dublin based companies; and to develop the competitiveness and export potential of existing businesses in the regions. As 35% of Enterprise Ireland's client companies are located in towns of 3,000 or under, the agency's remit is very widespread and is not confined to large urban areas. Enterprise Ireland assigns a development adviser to work with each client company to assist clients in achieving profitable growth. A tailored package is then developed for each company.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">Enterprise Ireland is committed to achieving balanced regional economic development. This commitment involves facilitating the expansion of Dublin based companies to regional locations, an option that Enterprise Ireland is continuing to promote to larger Dublin based companies. While Shannon Development does not use a 5,000 population delineation in terms of categorising towns and activities, it implements a mix of interventions for each sub-regional centre under its control. Shannon Development targets key centres, county towns, outside its key growth areas of Limerick and Shannon.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">The 35 city and county enterprise boards provide dispersed economic development throughout the country, including urban areas, developing indigenous enterprise potential, stimulating economic activity at local level and promoting micro-enterprises. The boards provide a single point of contact at local level and complement the activities of the other industrial development agencies. They support individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. I am confident that the measures outlined above, which are currently being adopted by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring positive results to the country. Along with the industrial development agencies, I will continue to promote Ireland with international firms for suitable industrial development projects.</summary>

          <p eId="para_967">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 102 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Sixteen investigations into company law matters have been initiated by me since I became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1997. In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, following an application by me. The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June. Section 8 inquiries are continuing into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited. A further interim report was presented to the High Court on 24 July and it is anticipated that a final report will be submitted to the High Court during the first half of 2003. As in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the question of whether the reports are published is entirely a matter for the High Court. The High Court ordered the publication of the Ansbacher report. An investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990 was completed in 1998 and the report has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, of which five have been concluded. The reports relating to two of the five investigations completed were passed to the DPP. The file in another case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded. The report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. My Department is considering whether this report should be referred to other authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_54">Four investigations under section 19 are ongoing. Reports in respect of two of the four  investigations are at an advanced stage of completion. Two investigations were held up because of legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June 2002. The High Court ruled on certain constitutional issues which had been referred back to the High Court by the Supreme Court. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on these latter investigations. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department amount to €9.6 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of civil servants working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations relates to the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of the figure of €9.6 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8.

The report has been in the public arena since its publication in June and its conclusions are available to influence the relevant policy areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Factors identified in my area of responsibility include the role of competition in ensuring that consumers get value for money and the need to critically examine regulation that constrains competition. I have taken the steps necessary to strengthen the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices and my priority is to ensure the removal of unwarranted restrictions on competition in all sectors of the economy. If competition is to be effective, consumers must be given a real choice and must be given sufficient information to enable them to exercise the choice in a rational way. I propose to strengthen existing rules governing the display of prices and to clarify the obligations of retailers and other traders in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_977">The interdepartmental agency review group on public safety examined the State's approach to public safety and the adequacy of the existing approach. The group sought to identify deficiencies in the approach and to develop a co-ordinated, cohesive and comprehensive approach to the subject. Con sultations with all Departments and agencies were undertaken and over 50 submissions were received from other interested bodies. These submissions primarily dealt with road safety, licensing of events, the regulation of the electrical industry and building controls. The review group also carried out research on how public safety is addressed in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">While the Government has not made a final decision on the report of the review group, I have serious concerns about setting up an agency to deal specifically with public safety regulation.

It may well be that a more co-ordinated approach to the issues involved is required, rather than setting up a new agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_980">The 2002 employment action plan was prepared in the context of guidelines agreed under the EU employment strategy. The plan covers a wide range of actions under the broad headings of preventing long-term unemployment and assisting people in the transition from unemployment to employment; providing incentives for labour market participation through taxation and benefit structures; tackling labour market bottlenecks, including skills shortages; tackling discrimination and exclusion of all disadvantaged or marginalised groups; modernising work organisation and the reconciliation of work and family life; and tackling gender gaps and gender mainstreaming.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">Under the employment action plan, it was envisaged that employment would grow by 24,000 by the end of 2002. Most recent statistics from the CSO show that 1,749,900 persons are in employment, an increase of 33,500 in the year to May 2002. Another indicator in the employment action plan is the achievement of a higher employment rate with an EU target of 67% by 2005 and 70% by 2010. The employment rate in Ireland grew from 59.4% to 65.7% between 1997 and 2001.</p>

The fact that it appears to show that prices of items can vary between different types of retail outlet highlights the value of shopping around for the most competitive prices.

          <p eId="para_989">The competitiveness of the economy is kept under review by the national competitiveness council, which advises the Taoiseach and I each year. The council's annual competitiveness report for 2002 will be launched later this month, as will its annual competitiveness challenge document in which it sets out its assessment of the key challenges we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">While I do not wish to anticipate what the council may say, I believe the competitiveness challenges we face are broadly known. I had occasion to refer to many of them at the recent plenary session of the PPF and I will briefly recap them now. We are in a period of uncertainty and volatility in a world economy that faces immense challenges of creating new and sustainable growth. The drivers of competitiveness that have brought us success in the past are not the same as those needed for the future. Low business costs, in terms of wages and taxation, have been important factors in encouraging and maintaining investment in Ireland. Wage and unit costs have increased rapidly recently, however, as have the prices of other business inputs. This growth in costs must be moderated while we pursue strategies to move to higher value-added, knowledge-based activities. Making this shift requires investment in education and research capabilities and enhancement of our ability to adapt and use technology in enterprise. In parallel with this we must continue our efforts to address infrastructure deficits in areas such as transport, telecommunications and energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">These would be huge challenges even if we were operating in a relatively benign environment, but we know that this is not the case. The current economic environment will require us to prioritise and to make difficult choices. The Government will not be found wanting both in keeping the competitiveness agenda to the fore and in taking the necessary steps to ensure that our national competitiveness, which is essential to our future growth, is sustained.</p>

          <p eId="para_993">I have no plans to request the industrial development agencies to initiate an additional intensive job creation programme for the mid-west region as I am satisfied that the efforts of Shannon Development and IDA Ireland, which are the relevant agencies in this context, are continuing to show results in terms of job creation and maintenance of existing jobs in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">The 2002 employment survey is currently under way and while preliminary indications are that job numbers may be slightly down on 2001, both Shannon Development and IDA Ireland believe that the economic prospects for the mid-west region remain positive. Shannon Development considers that the key to development of the indigenous industry sector is through the development of international markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises must harness all the potential competitive advantages they can gather if they are to be successful in these markets. Shannon Development has two fundamental approaches to supporting the indigenous sector: development of new indigenous industry and maintenance of existing indigenous industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">A number of new approaches have been taken by Shannon Development to improve the indigenous sector's competitiveness and efficiency. Among these are the world-class business programme designed specifically for small businesses seeking improvement in their business and manufacturing processes; the e-cluster pilot initiative targeted at small businesses with the objective of making companies aware of the benefits of e-business and e-commerce; the exporters' club focused on a small number of SMEs who have just started or who are planning to enter export markets; and AlumniStart, a new programme specifically designed to assist Irish graduates to research and develop new business opportunities.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_61">There were 17 first time visits by overseas companies to the mid-west region between January and October this year, compared to 16 first time visits by such companies in the same period last year. IDA Ireland continues to market the mid-west as a location for foreign direct investment. The global climate for inward investment is experiencing a slowdown and there appears little sign of a recovery in the immediate future. Much  of the new investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and seeking emerging investors in existing or new activities or sectors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">Approximately half the new projects in manufacturing and international services currently negotiated by the IDA each year come from the existing base of overseas companies in Ireland. Given the critical mass of foreign direct investment established in the mid-west, the greatest potential contribution is likely to come from existing clients. For example NETg based at the National Technological Park in Limerick since 1998 expanded its e-learning product development and innovation centre operation, creating an additional 270 jobs over the next three years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">The focus on developing existing clients is, therefore, critical. The IDA is actively seeking to facilitate a progression in the sophistication and breadth of existing client's Irish operations. This means not only increasing value added in their manufacturing operations, but also adding corporate level innovation, such as research and development, and service, logistics and supply chain management functions alongside manufacturing. The objective is to create more rounded and strategically important operations within the overall corporation. Such operations are better embedded and more suited to the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy in the medium to long term.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">Under the micro-enterprise measure of the regional operational programme, the city and county enterprise boards in the region continue, with EU funding, to support micro-enterprises employing under ten people, with financial intervention and entrepreneurial development of management and e-commerce skills, and enterprise education in second level schools. While any deterioration in these figures is disappointing, the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. I am confident that, given the commitment of the industrial development agencies, we can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms.</summary>

          <p eId="para_997">Employment rights legislation has grown in volume, scope and complexity since the 1970s and  that complexity extends also to the mechanisms for inspection, enforcement and the resolution of conflict. Without in any way eroding the protection of workers, it is timely to look at the roles and procedures of bodies such as the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission and the Employment Appeals Tribunal; the mechanisms to deal with the resolution of conflict in situations where, for example, workers feel they are unable to exercise their rights; and the appellate mechanisms which come into play after the rights commissioners or the tribunal have made recommendations. In short, we need to look at the system of rights and responsibilities which has developed, often in response to EU initiatives, and which has been grafted on to existing institutions to ensure that the system is clear, coherent and user-friendly.</p>

In particular, the group reached agreement on the treatment of older workers, insurability requirements, ceilings on wages, qualification periods, determination of weekly pay, non-reckonable service, employees working abroad, fines and penalties and the link between redundancy and training. Administrative issues that were agreed include the rounding of years of service, forms used in the administration of the scheme and the need for a new computer system. The Government has agreed to proceed with the implementation of these changes and my Department will prepare the necessary legislation to give effect to the policy changes.

      if it is intended for the Competition Authority to carry out an investigation of the monopolistic practices of a company (details supplied) in regard to the ease of access to the innovative, new Internet access services; her views on whether there is free competition and ease of access into the market with regard to the provision of flat-rate Internet access charges; and her further views on the current charges that apply for the local broadband connections operated by the main telecommunications supplier.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_69">In accordance with the Government's 1999 decision to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to  training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on community employment in 2002 is expected to be about 28,000, with a projected year end participation rate of 25,000. The reduction of 5,800 is due to a combination of restructuring, the continuation of mainstreaming community employment schools services and budgetary requirements. Discussions on the Estimates provision for 2003 are currently under way and are due to conclude soon. Participation rates on community employment next year will depend on the level of funding available for these programmes in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">The national employment service is available to assist community employment participants and other unemployed persons to progress to employment in the open labour market or further education or training opportunities, as they finish their term on the programme. In addition, the high supports process, which will be launched on a pilot basis in the near future, will provide appropriate supports to meet the needs of those who because of age, literacy or other barriers are unlikely to succeed in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market. The high supports process will build on the existing guidance and counselling services provided under the dual stranded national employment service to help people to become ready for a job.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">FÁS has discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on community employment, having regard to their personal development needs and future employment prospects. The three year cap on participation has been removed for those over 50 who continue to experience difficulties in finding employment, having spent three years on the programme. FÁS may offer a further period on the programme for such participants, on a case by case basis. FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality, and co-ordinates reductions to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of community employment. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ringfenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given top priority. Community employment places in the health sector, including personal assistant services, are being maintained at their level of the start of the year to ensure continuity of their delivery.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">FÁS is undertaking an internal review of community employment, including an assessment of the role of the programme in regard to the provision of community services. The PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment and the provision of community services, and which will include detailed consideration on any  future role for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in this regard. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of community employment for the future.</summary>

The latest official figures published by the Central Statistics Office, however, show that food prices increased by 2.6% in the year ended September 2002. This figure is 4.1% lower than the annual rate of inflation for food products recorded for the same period last year. Food inflation is also well below the overall annual rate of inflation of 4.5%. These figures do not support assertions of excessive general levels of price increases in the food sector since the changeover to the euro.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">Discussions on a proposal for a directive on working conditions for temporary agency workers between the social partners at European level, under the provisions of the social protocol, began in June 2000. Agreement could not be reached after 11 months of discussion, however, due to an inability to agree as to how the pay and conditions of agency workers should be established. Employers' representatives wanted them to be determined in comparison to other agency workers, while unions' representatives wanted such comparisons to be made with the permanent employees in the place of work in which the agency worker was placed. The initiative then fell to Anna Diamantopoulou, the Social Affairs and Employment Commissioner, to attempt to move the agenda forward. The European Commission published its formal proposal on 20 March 2002 and provided that after a period of six weeks agency workers could compare themselves with employees in the end-user company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The draft directive has been the subject of detailed article by article discussions in the relevant Council working group – the Social Affairs Questions Group – since last June. In parallel, the European Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee has also been examining the proposal under the co-decision process laid down in the Maastricht treaty. I understand that the European Parliament is scheduled to vote on the 140 or so amendments tabled by this committee at its plenary session later this month. In the meantime, the Government will continue to play a positive role in ensuring that a satisfactory outcome is achieved to reflect the concerns of the various interested parties in Ireland.</p>

The two directives concerned, namely, Council Directive 75/129/EEC of 17 February 1975 and amending Council Directive 92/56/EEC of 24 June 1992, were transposed into Irish law by means of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, the Protection of Employment Order, 1996, and the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations, 2000. Accordingly, Irish law already fully meets the requirements of the European Union in this area and no further action is needed to implement the 1998 directive which is simply a consolidating measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_1029">The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of our economy, is one of the highest in the world and certainly one of the highest in Europe. Ireland has for a long time received a far higher proportion of foreign direct investment inflows into the EU than our population, which is 1% of the EU's total, would suggest. In 2000, for example, Ireland received 10% of the EU's foreign direct investment, a large proportion of it from the United States. While 2001 ended with a small net loss in IDA backed jobs, the period between 1992 and 2002, taken as a whole, showed a rise of almost 44% in the number of foreign direct investment companies operating in Ireland and an increase of over 75% in permanent employment. Just over 50% of job approvals between 1992 and 2001 came from clients already located in Ireland, with the rest coming from greenfield projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">The focus on developing the IDA's existing clients is therefore critical. The IDA is actively seeking to facilitate a progression in the sophistication and breadth of its clients' Irish operations. This means not only increasing value in their manufacturing operations, but also adding corporate level innovation, such as research and development, and service, logistics and supply chain management functions alongside manufacturing. The objective is to create more rounded and strategically important operations within the overall corporation. Such operations are better embedded and more suited to the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy in the medium to long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The support on offer to mobile investors includes a comprehensive service to client companies, by co-ordinating services and supports to ensure efficient and trouble free start-ups. To increase embeddedness in the economy, the IDA has adopted a strategic model of the path multinationals might typically follow as they move into higher value functions. The IDA has targeted moves on this model by client companies and has a set of instruments to support this. It is also backed up by a number of incentive schemes focused, for example, on encouraging clients to undertake the establishment of a dedicated research and development centre in Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_73">The IDA is fully committed to achieving a target of locating 50% of new greenfield jobs in the 2000-06 period in the Objective One region. This is consistent with the regional policy objectives set out in the national development plan. The process of creating new greenfield jobs in the  Objective One region is initiated with first time site visits by overseas investors to the region. Following on from this, the expectation is for IDA Ireland to secure at least 50% of all greenfield job approvals for the Objective One region. Typically, new jobs on the ground come on stream within three to five years of approval. In 1999, prior to the start of the current national development plan, about 25% of all new greenfield jobs were locating in the Objective One region. This figure rose to 45% and 42%, respectively, in 2000 and 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">A secure legal environment for e-business is essential to promote Ireland as an e-business hub. Significant progress has been made in that regard through the enactment of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000, which established legal recognition of e-business transactions in most areas of business, private law and public administration. The Act was one of the first such pieces of legislation in the world. The Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 modernised Irish copyright law with the information society in mind. The Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002, which was brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and which gives effect to the EU data protection directive, is currently before the Dáil.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">Other measures to give effect to EU legislation are imminent or will follow in the near future under the aegis of various Ministers. Further measures needed to underpin our e-business strategy and to maintain the competitive advantage we have built up in this area will be considered as required. Two recent Forfás reports, eBusiness, Where Are We and Where Do We Go From Here? and Legislating for Competitive Advantage in eBusiness and Information and Communications Technologies, contain proposals that are addressed to a number of Ministers and will require detailed examination in this context. The provision of telecommunication services including broadband is a matter in the first instance for companies that operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seeks to address gaps in communications infrastructure in the regions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1033">I thank the Joint Committee on Education and Science for its comprehensive and constructive report on science and technology, which included a recommendation that the Government should establish a specific Oireachtas committee to deal with all aspects of science and technology. Responsibility for establishing such committees is a matter for the Oireachtas itself. The Deputy may wish to note that in March 2002 the Government asked the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation to establish a high-level commission to develop an overarching framework for national policy in research and technological development. As part of its terms of reference, the commission will look at the current situation in Ireland relating to the structures, policies and implementation mechanisms for research and technological development that underpin innovation for economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The commission is expected to submit its proposals to me, for the consideration of the Government, by the end of the year and I believe that the final report of the commission will be of assistance to the Oireachtas when deciding whether to establish a science and technology committee. The Deputy may also wish to note that, under the science, technology and innovation awareness programme managed by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology, I will shortly launch a new initiative called Friends of Science. The intention is to establish an informal cross-Oireachtas group of Members who have a background or an interest in science, technology and engineering and who will become advocates of science.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">The number of redundancies notified to my Department in 2001 was 19,828. In the first ten months of 2002 a total of 21,024 redundancies were notified.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_76">As regards anticipated job losses, one indicator of this is the number of collective redundancies notified to my Department under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977. These are the numbers of employees that companies have indicated that they propose to make redundant after the statu tory minimum notification period of thirty days. A total of 8,218 collective redundancies were notified in the first ten months of 2002. The equivalent figure for the same period in 2001 was 13,448.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">I recognise the difficulties which the loss of jobs pose for the workers made redundant and their families, as well as for the companies involved. FÁS continues to provide a wide range of support services to facilitate workers affected in finding alternative employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">The increased level of job losses in the current year arise from the continuing effect on the Irish economy of the deterioration in the international economic environment. Following several years of high-level growth by the Irish economy, averaging more than 8% between 1995 and 2000, the rate of growth slowed in 2001 to 5%. This reflected adverse developments in some of the most important sectors of the Irish economy. The agricultural and tourism sectors suffered as a result of the foot and mouth crisis, while the information and communications technology, ICT, sector in Ireland contracted in the face of the global collapse in investment in ICT goods and services. More broadly, the Irish economy was adversely affected by weaker consumer demand in Ireland's main trading partners and the impact on global trade and investment flows of the events of 11 September. Many of these global dynamics continued to weaken the domestic economy into 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">It is important that we keep recent events in perspective. The Central Bank is forecasting a growth rate of around 3% for 2002. Although well below growth rates in the 1995-2000 period, Ireland's economic performance in 2002 continues to outpace that of other EU member states, and job creation remains robust in both the foreign-owned and indigenous enterprise sectors. It is clear that our recent difficulties result from global economic conditions and pressures, and, for the most part, Ireland's competitive strengths remained fundamentally sound. For instance, it is worth recording that, despite the worst downturn in the history of the ICT sector, the five leading companies in the sector in Ireland – Intel, Dell, IBM, HP and Microsoft – continue to maintain overall aggregate employment levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">There is still considerable interest in Ireland among the many leading international companies for higher-level activities. IDA Ireland is competing strongly at present for a range of significant investments and expects to be able to announce important new investment projects in the coming months, especially in the pharmaceuticals, healthcare and international services sectors. Meanwhile, development is proceeding in a number of major investments currently under way. Enterprise Ireland continues its work with indigenous companies with the objective of maximising the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs. That agency's wide-ranging  activities include supporting the setting up of high-potential start-up companies, increasing innovation and competitiveness of existing companies through investment in research and development, upskilling of staff, and developing access to overseas markets.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">There are signs of a pick-up in global economic activity, which should have a beneficial impact on the Irish economy in 2003. Assuming that the pace of international recovery continues, the Central Bank has predicted a modest acceleration in Irish economic growth to about 4.5% in 2003. Whether the forecast global economic recovery will benefit Ireland depends, however, on our ability to remain competitive in international markets. This will require that we continue to address costs and other factors that threaten to undermine the competitive position of industry, with negative consequences for Irish economic growth and employment.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1126">While EU law precludes member states from intervening directly in relation to the actual pricing of insurance, Governments are free to take appropriate action leading to cost reduction by the industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1128">In parallel with overseeing implementation of this reform programme, I am supporting an examination of the competitiveness of the insurance sector. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, will be carrying out a study concerning the non-life insurance market, with particular reference to motor insurance, employer's liability and public liability insurance. The preliminary consultation document, containing the draft terms of reference for the study has been published and is available electronically at either www.entemp.ie or www.tca.ie.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_488">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1158">In the period since their formation, in 1993, the city and county enterprise boards have filled an undoubted gap in the enterprise support framework. While the bulk of Exchequer funding for enterprise development is rightly allocated to businesses with a strong growth and export orientation, the  great body of small and very small enterprises throughout the country are an indispensable part of the enterprise sector and also merit appropriate support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">Much progress has been made by indigenous enterprises in manufacturing and international services over the past decade. Most of the very large gain in employment recorded over this period came from small and medium-sized Irish-owned businesses in the services sector. The evidence suggests that there has been a high level of new enterprise formation in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">Despite the improved business environment of recent years, many micro-enterprises still suffer from the resource and management weaknesses and limitations that have traditionally affected small and very small enterprises. The county enterprise boards have a vital role to play in catering for this segment of the enterprise sector. This applies particularly to the provision of advice, information, and skills and management development. While carefully targeted financial support will continue to be an important role for the boards, its provision must inevitably be constrained both by other demands on scarce resources and by the need to minimise the inefficient use of such resources through deadweight and displacement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">With their dual focus on enterprise and local development, the CEBs have a particularly important part to play in helping to bring about more balanced regional development. While systematic efforts are under way to achieve a better distribution of very large, large, and medium-sized enterprise throughout the regions, the infrastructural and other needs of such projects mean that they will tend to cluster around the existing large urban areas or the proposed new gateway towns and their associated development hubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">Consequently, small and micro-enterprises will remain critically important for small towns, villages, and rural areas in all parts of the country. Enterprises of all sizes and types have a key role to play in ensuring that less developed areas can offer the spread of business, consumer and personal services needed to sustain vibrant local economies and communities. In time, a minority of these businesses will, if the national and business environment is supportive, grow and this may in turn stimulate the formation of other enterprises. A number of high-potential start-up businesses now supported by Enterprise Ireland first received backing from county enterprise boards. The boards will continue to encourage and support the establishment of new micro-enterprises, and the expansion of existing ones, particularly in the less-developed areas within their boundaries. The boards will provide the information, advice, training, and in appropriate cases financial support, which will help those businesses sustain themselves. As with its e-learning and e-commerce initiatives, the boards will actively seek out innovative ways of providing targeted support to small and very small business.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_101">The boards will also give priority to identifying micro-enterprises that have the capability and potential for substantial and sustained growth. They will assist these businesses to identify and develop suitable market and product opportunities, and will help them develop the relations with larger companies, higher educational institutions, venture capital providers and others needed to provide a platform for expansion. They will liaise with Enterprise Ireland to ensure that, when such businesses reach the stage of development at which they are more appropriately dealt with by EI, the transition is smooth and straightforward for the enterprise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_102">Finally, the boards will continue to place an emphasis on their work in schools and communities to encourage and promote a spirit of enterprise. While the fruits of this work may not be apparent in the short term, it is an important part of the broader developmental mandate of the boards. The county enterprise boards have an important role to play in implementing the programmes and helping achieve the targets set out in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I am pleased to say that, in fact, they have exceeded their targets so far. Prior to the conclusion of the NDP, it will be necessary to review all the enterprise support services, to ensure that, going forward, we have in place the structures to achieve continued growth in all sectors of our economy, including the micro-enterprise sector.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1164">The management of the industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. I have not received any requests for funding from the IDA in relation to the remedial works for the sewer and services at Ballybrit. I understand that the services in question were constructed by IDA Ireland in the mid 1970s and involved bringing foul sewer-surface sewer and water services from the then existing services at IDA Ireland's Ballybrit Industrial Estate to service new lands acquired by the agency at Parkmore, located to the west of Galway city.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_103">These services are owned by IDA Ireland and are the sole means of providing these services to the Galway Business and Technology Park – Parkmore east and west. At the time of construc tion, all costs – which were considerable – attributed to the development of these services were borne by IDA Ireland. While IDA Ireland has indicated it has no objection in principle to the taking-in-charge of these services by Galway County Council, it must be noted that this would represent no strategic benefit to the agency in its industrial development remit. Thus, it is the view of the IDA that, in any such transfer, a proportion of the remaining capacity in both the foul sewer and the water supply must be reserved for industrial development use. This remaining capacity is vital for the future marketing and development of the Galway Business and Technology Park, which is dependant on having a water supply and foul disposal capability that meets with the potential needs of IDA client companies. Galway City Council has informed IDA Ireland that it requires the agency to undertake approximately €400,000 of remedial works to the services infrastructure prior to Galway City Council taking the services in charge. The works in question relate to parts of the infrastructure which may need future replacement in the short to medium term due to its age. It is the view of IDA Ireland that the services infrastructure does not require remedial expenditure of the magnitude required by Galway City Council. The agency currently has no plans to undertake the remedial works required by Galway City Council, as they are not deemed necessary at this time. I understand ongoing discussions are taking place between the IDA and the county council on this issue with a view to resolving the matter to the satisfaction of both parties.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1168">It is expected that the liquidator would seek to sell the plant and machinery on the Marino Point site as this would have a significant value. In these circumstances, it would be a matter for the purchasers to dismantle and take away any articles purchased. In addition, figures which were prepared for the company recently, involving an external environmental consultant, suggested that the cost of the environmental clean-up of the Marino Point site would amount to some €3 million, though this was a tentative estimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">However, I should point out that the responsibility for the site, including any obligations in relation to its clean-up, will continue to rest with the company, even when it is in liquidation. In this regard, the fact that the site has a significant value should ensure that any remedial works required will be carried out by the liquidator or by any new owner of the site.</p>

These sessions included inputs from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners. During week beginning 4 November FÁS will register all IFI employees and give initial guidance interviews on career planning. On 13 November the registration and interview process will be assessed and training and retraining requirements will be agreed with FÁS and IFI representatives. IDA will liaise with FÁS on training course content to match the needs of recently announced start-up and expansions of IDA companies in the affected areas – FÁS,  IDA – start your own business seminars are scheduled to be held in the week starting 4 November in Arklow and Cork for IFI employees.

          <p eId="para_1188">The labour inspectorate of this Department is responsible for monitoring the employment conditions of the various categories of all workers, including immigrant workers. In this regard, the inspectorate can pursue allegations of workers being subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions from pay, non-payment of compensation for Sunday working or of holiday-public holiday pay, etc. In the event that evidence of non-compliance with employment rights legislation is found the inspectorate will seek redress for the individuals who have been mistreated and, if appropriate, a prosecution will be initiated. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">In 2001 the inspectorate undertook just under 6,500 inspections and ensured the payment of almost €520,000 in arrears of wages to employees. Also, in 2001, the inspectorate referred 31 cases to the Chief State Solicitor's office for prosecution. Of these, 26 cases were successfully concluded leading to 17 convictions and fines including, in most instances, the awarding of expenses and costs. So far this year the inspectorate has undertaken in excess of 4,500 inspections mainly dealing with issues arising from more than 1,000 case-files and €325,130 has been obtained in arrears of wages for employees. Furthermore, 15 cases have been referred for legal proceedings leading to 13 convictions while two cases were withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">A major project this year has been the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures. This new IT system will come online early next year and will be the result of considerable investment by my Department over the last two years (approximately €750,00 when completed) and will provide the technological support to enable Inspectors operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike while also improving the interaction with the enforcement side of the process.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_129">It is important to note that our employment rights legislation, which establishes the statutory rights applicable to workers whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, is applicable to all people working Ireland. The legislation makes no distinction whatsoever between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers and as such, all workers in Ireland, without exception, are  entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_130">In other words, Irish employment rights legislation applies to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as it does to native Irish workers. For the avoidance of doubt, statutory effect to this grounding principle was recently established in section 21 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">In the area of work permits specifically, you will be aware that legislation is planned and is currently with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. The legislation will make it an offence for a person to work here without a work permit, when a valid permit is a requirement for that individual, and it will also be an offence for an employer to employ someone in respect of whom a valid work permit is not in existence when such a permit is a requirement. Stringent penalties are envisaged in respect of these offences. In addition, new powers of inspection, search and investigation are proposed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">On an ongoing basis a more thorough regime of checking of work permit applications is being implemented including more cross referencing of documentation. In the meantime a policy is in place whereby the processing of work permit applications for any employer is suspended when the Department becomes aware of any concerns regarding that employer's compliance with the obligations set out in the various employment rights enactments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">I am aware of reports regarding the mistreatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here on foot of work permit applications and I totally condemn such abuses of the workers concerned. That small number of employers who engage in these practices are on notice that they will not succeed in ignoring their statutory obligations to any employee. Moreover, this minority of employers have to be aware of the effect their actions have on Ireland's international image and the potential negative impact their behaviour has on our capacity to attract investment and necessary skills from abroad. In this regard however, the fact that 40% of work permits granted to date in 2002 are renewals, is indicative of a growing level of stability and satisfaction in employeremployee relationships in this area and evidence that it is a limited number of employers that fall into the 'undesirable' category.</summary>

The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by me, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target time frame; establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.

          <p eId="para_1345">I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 to 197, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Married quarters are provided for serving personnel of the Permanent Defence Force. The Department of Defence has no responsibility for the provision of accommodation for ex-members of the force or their families. Soldiers, on being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force, are obliged to vacate married quarters within a number of weeks of their discharge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">On 26 August 2002 the Department wrote to the occupiers of 54 quarters which were overheld and requested that they vacate the quarters in which they were residing. Officials of the Department have since then interviewed the persons concerned in order to establish the particular circumstances in each case. It is now the Department's intention to work with Kildare County Council, the statutory body responsible for housing, with a view to resolving the problem of overholding and it is hoped to meet with officials of the council in the near future in this regard. All options will be discussed with the council, including affordable housing, shared ownership and co-op housing schemes. Every effort will be made to ensure that the council offers assistance in all cases where the individuals are eligible for local authority housing and also grant applications for mortgages in cases where overholders have been offered sale of the quarters such as those at Orchard Park. Each case will be considered on its own merits and the Department will be in further contact with each of the individuals concerned in due course. In the interim no further action will be taken in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">It is the practice of the military authorities to reallocate vacated quarters to serving personnel. There are no plans at present to demolish any married quarters in the Curragh Camp. It is long established practice to withhold the pensions of former soldiers who do not vacate married quarters on their discharge from the Defence Forces in order to cover the cost of overholding charges and damages to the property. However, it is also the practice for individuals to seek and be granted regular advances of pension. There are no cases in which entire pensions remain withheld.</p>

          <p eId="para_1353">I believe that an amendment to the Defence Act to allow the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, to apply to members of the Defence Forces would be wholly inappropriate. I am aware that PDFORRA has placed a certain stress on the concept of the soldier as a "citizen in uniform" with the implication that the soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally. The position is that when an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts, <i>inter alia</i>, a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative association through the Defence Forces' conciliation and arbitration scheme – with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussion during national pay talks – provide a framework within which issues of concern can and should be addressed. I add that members of the Defence Forces have been offered and have accepted the terms of all recent national pay agreements.</p>

          <p eId="para_1359">The benchmarking process is a genuine attempt to set pay levels for the Irish public service in the context of the Irish economy. Benchmarking represents an open, independent, innovative and progressive way of tackling the issue of setting appropriate pay levels. The process provided the Defence Forces representative associations with an opportunity to present their cases in relation to their members' pay levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">The Public Service Benchmarking Body, PSBB, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness issued its report on 1 July 2002. The body linked implementation of its report's recommendations to modernisation in the public service. Under the terms of the adjustment to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed with the public service unions in December 2000, one quarter of any recommended increases would be paid with effect from 1 December 2001. The PSBB recommended that payment of the balance of the increases recommended in its report should be dependent on the achievement of real and verifiable outputs from modernisation, change, adaptability and flexibility. Discussions between the public service employers and unions on the implementation of the recommendations are ongoing, with a particular emphasis on the issues of change, modernisation and verification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">In conjunction with this process, parallel talks are being held with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations; PDFORRA, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association; and RACO, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, on the implementation of the PSBB's recommendations in the Defence Forces. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be premature for me to comment on the outcome of those discussions at this stage.</p>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1363">Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued  through the United Nations, which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN possesses no standing military forces of its own and relies on the provision of such resources by willing members. The Government, contrary to misguided speculation, remains determined to continue to contribute actively to UN peacekeeping. Our future contribution will, of course, take into account the changing and more complex nature of peacekeeping, which involves additional tasks such as humanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights and civilian police work. Ireland's commitment to the headline goal consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations standby arrangements system, UNSAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">With the development of European security and defence policy, the question of how the two are linked together is often asked. The answer is that one complements the other and they are mutually reinforcing. The UN has encouraged regional approaches to peacekeeping and there have recently been discussions between representatives of the UN and the EU on peacekeeping and crisis management issues. The level of co-operation between the EU and the UN will deepen and will be enhanced as ESDP develops.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">The Government will decide on a case-by-case basis whether, when and how to commit either troops or other resources to any peace support operation. In accordance with the relevant legislation, participation requires UN authorisation, a specific Government decision and Dáil approval – the so-called triple lock. Our commitment to the headline goal is therefore fully consistent with Ireland's approach to overseas peacekeeping and consistent with our foreign policy traditions. Ireland has a significant contribution to make to the continuing development of security policy and it is vital that it remains at the centre of that process and continues to influence the development of these policies both within the UN and within the European Union.</p>

The range of disposal costs agreed under the most recent tender procedure were between €225 and €275 per tonne. A number of proposals for the use of MBM either in industry or energy generation in this country are at various stages of consideration by the relevant regulatory authorities, including the Environment Protection Agency.

The last office will be completed this week. The provision of access to mapping information is being tested at present to ensure that it does not interfere with other network traffic to these offices. Deployment to our local offices will begin as soon as testing is completed. It was simpler to deploy the facilities provided at the National Ploughing Championships in Ballacolla, County Laois, in September, since there were no other IT facilities involved. In the case of Clontibret and Ballymacscanlon, standalone versions of the old land parcel information system were deployed in these locations at the time. Accordingly, there was no network traffic and therefore no impact on other IT facilities at these temporary offices.</p>

This directive governs the use of such substances and products in all member states. Under the directive, materials containing high levels of undesirable substances, which are to be incorporated into animal feedstuffs, may only be sold to approved establishments which have the expertise and equipment to handle such materials. The seaweed meal referred to contains high levels of arsenic and consequently may only be sold to such approved establishments. These approved premises are permitted to use the seaweed in the manufacture of animal feed for sale to farmers once the arsenic levels in such manufactured feeds does not exceed the maximum permitted levels of arsenic as laid down in the directive. There are 14 approved establishments in this country to which the seaweed product in question can be sold.</p>

We are awaiting the opinion of the scientific committee on this matter.

          <p eId="para_1457">I remain fully committed to the principles of the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which provides the means by which each individual animal in the national flock can be identified and traced from birth to carcass, with ensuing benefits in areas such as disease monitoring and control, consumer assurance, flock management and so on. Based on its own monitoring my Department believes that the NSIS is generally working well. I have, however, always made it clear that specific difficulties which flock owners may encounter will be examined with a view to resolving such difficulties within the key parameters of the system.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_139">In this context and as a result of feedback to the Department from flock owners and via farmer representative bodies it is acknowledged that a full reconciliation with the flock register may be difficult for some farmers given the fact that the group approach to recording of details in the register had been agreed. To address this problem I have decided that the reconciliation for 2002 should be simplified. A letter outlining full details of this adjustment in approach is being issued to all flock owners this week. My Department is also examining a submission received on 11 October 2002 from the IFA suggesting certain adjustments to the NSIS. Clarification on a number of points, in particular on the traceability element which is particularly important in terms of disease control and monitoring, has been  sought from the IFA. My Department will be better able to assess and respond to the submission once such clarification is to hand.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_140">Any further adjustments, refinements or improvements which might be contemplated by my Department will give due weight to the necessity to protect the integrity of both the identification and traceability dimensions of NSIS and to take account of forthcoming proposals from the EU. Any such refinements would, in any event, fall to be introduced in 2003 rather than this year.</summary>

Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty during the early 1980s or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s were eligible to apply.

          <p eId="para_1462">A total of 2,400 farmers applied for aid on 17,000 hectares of maize under the 2002 EU arable aid scheme. The increase in maize claims in 2002 gave rise to an overshoot of the national base area for maize. As a result and in accordance with EU regulations, payment for maize must be reduced in proportion to the amount of the excess claimed. The rate of payment for maize in 2002  has therefore been reduced by 57% to €157.56 per hectare. Having already received an advance payment of arable aid on 16 October 2002, the person named will receive a final balancing payment on 16 November 2002.</p>

The person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1499">The decisions to which I had referred included the decision by the Russian government to lift all restrictions on the six-county BSE ban, which was implemented following contacts between the Irish and Russian authorities and will substantially improve access to that market for Irish beef. In the current year I expect that exports of beef to that market will be of the order of 75,000 tonnes. Additionally, the European Commission decided to increase export refunds by up to 30% for Egypt following my representations to Commissioner Fischler. This new special high rate of export refund will make Irish beef more competitive on the Egyptian market and should help lead to the resumption of trade to a very important traditional market. Intensive efforts are ongoing with the Gulf region, the Philippines and Indonesia to have those markets re-opened to imports of Irish beef.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_142">In mid-October my Department hosted a week-long visit by technical experts from six Gulf  states who were invited to Ireland to examine food safety and consumer protection issues in relation to Irish beef. Another decision taken by the Commission at that time was to increase the rate of advance payments of the beef premiums from 60% to 80% in order to improve the cash flow of beef farmers generally and in particular those affected by the poor weather earlier this summer.</summary>

      the reason the basic level of REP scheme payment, which is made to farmers for ongoing works, has reduced in actual and real terms since the scheme was introduced in 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1590">As a condition of EU approval, REPS payment rates must be justified in accordance with strict regulatory criteria. The EU regulations governing REPS provide that support is to be calculated on the basis of income forgone and additional costs resulting from the commitment given together with the need to provide an incentive. Good farming practice is the reference level  for calculating income forgone and additional costs resulting from the commitments given, and the incentive element of the payment cannot exceed 20% of the costings. When proposals for the current scheme were submitted to the EU Commission in 1999 as part of the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, it was necessary to put forward detailed justification to support retention of the existing rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">In negotiating the current scheme, my Department however secured an increased payment of €165 per hectare on holdings under 20 hectares, and the generous rate of €242 per hectare for land under Measure A, first negotiated in 1998, was retained. Under the new REPS, the average annual payment is €4,900 as compared to an average payment of €4,400 in the previous scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592">I have recently announced a consultative process on REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that any proposals on REPS that may be put to the EU Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations. This process will cover all aspects of the scheme including payment rates.</p>

          <p eId="para_1594">Both REPS and the onfarm investment schemes are demand-led and my Department is not in any way seeking to delay processing of applications. The processing of applications under these and other schemes is closely monitored under the protocol on direct payments to farmers by a committee which includes representatives of the farm bodies, under an independent chair. The targets established under the protocol for approving applications and making payments are largely being met.</p>
          <p eId="para_1595">I am committed to simplifying the various schemes where possible, bearing in mind the need to comply with EU and other requirements. Earlier this year I took the step of removing the upper income ceiling for installation aid, freeing up that scheme considerably. In relation to REPS, I recently announced changes to the rules on title documentation and the introduction of a simplified farm plan format for extensive farming systems. These changes will come into effect in January 2003. I had previously introduced new arrangements under which all REPS planners will be given the facility with the agreement of their farmer client to access and download land parcel information from the LPIS. I am satisfied that, taken all together, these changes will contribute positively to the scheme's success into the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_149">I have in addition established a consultative process about REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. This process will cover all aspects of the scheme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1613">The dairy cow premium was part of a package of measures negotiated under Agenda 2000 and was the mechanism agreed to compensate farmers, by means of direct payment, for the planned reduction of 15% in the intervention price, to be implemented in three equal steps in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

          <p eId="para_1616">It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish livestock or beef exporters have unrestricted access to world markets. Intensive efforts are being made by me and my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to achieve this objective. It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of cattle or beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic contacts by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1617">As an example, my Department with the assistance of Bord Bia hosted a conference in Dublin in mid-October on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region and I am pleased that the conference was attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Indications are that the conference was very successful and that delegations were very impressed with the information and demonstrations they received regarding the safety of Irish beef. I would hope that this would ultimately lead to the reopening of these markets. We are also in contact with the authorities in South Africa, the Philippines and Indonesia with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_150">In regard to the live trade, there has been a resumption in trade in younger animals to markets in the EU such as Spain and Italy. The trade in finished animals to Lebanon is also continuing since that market reopened to us following the lifting of FMD restrictions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_151">The European Commission also increased export refunds on 27 September last by up to 30% for Egypt following my strong representations to Commissioner Fischler. Additionally the Commission has decided, following my representations, to increase the rate of advance payments of the beef premiums from 60% to 80% in order to improve the cash flow of beef farmers generally. This will improve the cash flow of Irish farmers by €80 million this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1620">As far as market price transparency is concerned, my Department endeavored over a lengthy period in 1999 and 2000, through the monitoring committee on the report of the beef task force, to secure the agreement of all of the interests in the beef industry to a voluntary price transparency mechanism. While substantial progress was made on a price transparency model, the industry, however, was unable to reach agreement on the issue of independent verification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">There is already a cattle price reporting mechanism in place at EU level which allows for comparability of prices for similar quality cattle on an EU wide basis.

Intensive efforts are being made by me and my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to achieve this objective. It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of cattle or beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic contacts by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">As an example, my Department with the assistance of Bord Bia hosted a conference in Dublin in mid-October on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region and I am pleased that the conference was attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Indications are that the conference was very successful and that delegations were very impressed with the information and demonstrations they received regarding the safety of Irish beef. I would hope that this would ultimately lead to the reopening of these markets. We are also in contact with the authorities in South Africa, the Philippines and Indonesia with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef.</p>

The negotiations involve a proposal by the EU to impose quotas on cereal imports by the EU with fixed tariffs. Compensation will be offered to affected countries for this change in the import duty system.

Prior to payment the Department is  required, under EU regulations, to carry out CMMS based cross-checks to ensure that the chosen stocking densities were not breached. In this case cross-checks were carried out on 1 June and 15 October 2001 and stocking densities of 1.5921 and 1.9901 livestock units per hectare respectively were found. Recently, a CMMS based herd profile was issued to the person named.

          <p eId="para_1679">The issues raised by the Deputy were covered in the answer given to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 170-173 and 175 on Tuesday, 16 October. That answer contained the following information:</p>
          <p eId="para_1680">Section 18(2) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, provides that each year there shall be paid into the National Pensions Reserve Fund, in equal quarterly instalments, a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established on 2 April 2001 with €6,515 million being allocated to the fund. This sum was comprised of the net proceeds of the sale of the former Telecom Éireann and 1% of GNP in 1999 and 2000 as well as interest earned on same.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_155">A total of €972 million, representing the 1% of GNP contribution, was paid into the fund in  2001. The first three quarterly payments of 2002, amounting to some €775 million, have already been made this year and the fourth payment of €258 million will be made in December. Thus, to end-September, 2002, total payments into the fund amounted to €8,262 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">According to the 2001 annual report submitted to me by the commission, the fund earned a return of 3.27% for the period to 31 December 2001 compared to a short-term benchmark return of 3.24%, and a long-term benchmark return of – 3.5%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">The fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to (a) the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the Act, and (b) the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">In this regard, the commission's report stated that the fund would be invested 80% in equities and 20% in bonds. As the investment strategy is designed with long-term returns in mind, short-term losses which may never be realised cannot be taken as an indicator of fund performance. The commission is required by law to submit to me an annual report and the next such report is due around mid-2003. At end 2001 the total value of moneys standing to the credit of the fund was €7,715 million which included interest earned on the contributions to date. Following is a table detailing contributions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund:</summary>

      the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has been asked for payment for under-computation of their tax liabilities in view of the fact that the under-deduction was as a result of an error on the part of the Revenue Commissioners; his proposals to introduce guidelines or regulations similar to social welfare where, if an error is made by the Revenue Commissioners in estimating individuals' PAYE liabilities, that this error should not impact negatively on the taxpayer or penalise the taxpayer in any way for those errors.

          <p eId="para_1724">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that regular checks are carried out to identify taxpayers who may have underpaid tax. The taxpayer in question was in receipt of pension income. The underpayment arose because he took up employment with the result that the combined income of the taxpayer and his wife left him open to liability at the higher rate of tax.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_171">Certificates of tax-free allowances for the 1999-2000 tax year had issued to the taxpayer showing liability at the standard rate of 24%, Tax Table R. However, the increase in income due to the taxpayer's return to employment meant that part  of the taxpayer's income became liable to tax at the higher rate of 46%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">A similar underpayment has arisen for the 2000-01 tax year. However the matter has been rectified for years following. The inspector proposes to collect the total extra liability on a phased basis over the next three tax years, that is, 2003, 2004 and 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">There is an onus on taxpayers to check that the information on their tax certificates is correct and, where it is not, to inform the tax office of any inaccuracies. When underpayments occur, inspectors of taxes are obliged to collect the amounts underpaid, as they are also obliged to repay amounts overpaid.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1729">I made it clear at the beginning of this year that I was determined to ensure that expenditure was on target. At the start of the year, I initiated a system of monthly expenditure management reports to Government. These are based on the end-month Exchequer returns and are designed to give the Government full and timely information on emerging spending trends so that it is in a position to take action if problems are identified.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_174">The Government has throughout the year adopted the approach that any unavoidable pressures on spending in some areas would have to be funded by equivalent offsetting savings in other areas. This approach was, for example, reflected in the decisions taken by the Government last June following the end-May Exchequer  issues. The Government decided at that time to provide additional funding of about €300 million to meet unavoidable pressures in relation to certain health service schemes, accommodation for homeless persons and asylum seekers, the national roads programme, school supervision and substitution arrangements and prison officer overtime. The Government also agreed a variety of offsetting measures designed to ensure that the increase in overall spending would not exceed the 14.4% increase provided for in the Revised Estimates.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_175">More recently, the Government decided to provide additional funding of about €200 million to meet further unavoidable pressures in the health and education sectors in relation to demand-led schemes and emerging shortfalls in appropriations-in-aid receipts. However, it appears likely that the €150 million provision for benchmarking will not now be paid in 2002 and, as in previous years, some end-year savings across Votes can also be expected to materialise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">The 2002 Revised Estimates provided for an increase of 14.4% in net voted expenditure and I am still aiming to ensure that spending overall will come in close to target. I intend to publish a forecast outturn as part of the 2003 Abridged Estimates volume later this month. The end-year issues for 2002 will not, of course, be available until early in January 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1739">In relation to the first named company, my Department used the consulting services of this company on a number of occasions between 1997 and 1999. The total value of this work amounted to €172,674. The greater part of this expenditure arose from a publicity campaign and related items by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. This amount also includes the cost of advertising the availability of lo-call telephone numbers to Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">The first named company, on amalgamation with another company, changed its name. My Department used the services of this company in 2001 to the value of €9,730. This expenditure related to the design of newspaper advertising and the supply of copy for radio advertising in relation to the special savings incentive accounts scheme. In relation to the second named company, the Central Bank has informed my Department that a member of its staff attended a course in 2001 run by a company with the same acronym as the second named company referred to by the Deputy.

          <p eId="para_1742">The general position is that section 231 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, exempts from tax the profits or gains arising to the owner or part-owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares by the stallion where the stallion is ordinarily kept on land in the State and where the services of the mares takes place in the State. The exemption also applies where a bloodstock breeder trading in the State acquires a share in a foreign stallion in order that mares owned or partly owned by the breeder may be serviced by the stallion. In this case, the exemption applies to tax on any profits or gains from the sale of any nominations from the breeders share in the stallion. Taxpayers are not required to include income arising from tax exempt stallion fees in their tax returns and the information sought by the Deputy on costs is therefore not available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1780">Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate, to individuals for rent paid for private rented accommodation which is their sole or main residence. The level of rent qualifying for relief under section 473 depends on an individual's marital status and age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781">For those aged under 55 years of age, the maximum level of rent on which income tax relief can be claimed is €1,270 per annum single and €2,540 per annum widowed/married. For those aged 55 years and over the maximum level of rent paid on which tax relief can be claimed is €2,540 per annum single and €5,080 per annum widowed-married.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">The relief is claimed by completion of a form rent 1. Any claim by the individual for relief under this section must be accompanied by a receipt or acknowledgement from the landlord in respect of the rent paid. The information obtained from the form regarding landlords is examined and used as part of Revenue's ongoing audit and investigation programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">The cost of rent relief for the year ended 31 December 2001 is estimated to be €25.5 million. This compares with an estimate of €18.3 million for the year ended 5 April 2001 and €13 million for the year ended 5 April 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">As regards a comparison between this cost and the tax take from landlords, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question Ref No. 15581/02 of 9 October 2002 in that connection. The position is that, while the yield from rental income can be broken down between individuals and companies, it is not possible to distinguish between income from private rental accommodation and other accommodation. For the year ended 5 April 2000, the last year for which this information is available, the estimated tax yield was €137 million from companies and €80 million from individuals.</p>

          <p eId="para_1786">The annual surplus from the Social Insurance Fund, SIF, is deposited. The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, section 7(3), provides that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the management of the social insurance fund  investment account. Section 28 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000, enabled the Minister for Finance to delegate his function in relation to the investment of the SIF to the agency and to give directions and issue guidelines to the agency, having first consulted with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">The investment instruments which may be held are those authorised for the purposes of the post office savings bank fund, and such other debt instruments and interest bearing accounts as are authorised for the purposes of the Trustee Authorised Investments Act, 1958, as amended, and the Trustee Authorised Investments Orders, 1967, to date. Given that the SIF has to meet the liability for short-term benefit payments, investing in volatile instruments such as equities would not be appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">As of 30 October 2002, the valuation at market prices of the SIF surplus invested with the NTMA was €1.088 billion. This surplus is currently being invested by the NTMA in three portfolios in a combination of euro bank deposits, cash and Exchequer notes. The annualised return on the investment is 3.91%. The total cash return on the portfolios since 11 July 2001, when the NTMA assumed responsibility for the SIF investment, has been €58,986,537.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">PRSI contributions are paid into the social insurance fund deposit account which is held in the Central Bank and attracts a variable overnight interest rate. Funds are transferred out of the deposit account as needed into the SIF current account from which all SIF liabilities are paid. The SIF deposit account amounted to €146.3 million on 30 October. The interest earned to date on the SIF deposit account in 2001 and 2002 was €6,532,523.24 and €6,809.387.88, respectively.</p>

The original termination date for this scheme was 31 July 2001. This deadline was extended to 31 December 2002 in the Finance Act, 2000, and extended for a second time by an additional two years to 31 December 2004 in the Finance Act, 2002. The latest extension to the scheme will apply to projects where the relevant local authority certifies by 30 April 2003 that 15% of total project costs have been incurred by 31 December 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1794">There are no proposals to extend the 31 December 2002 deadline for incurring 15% total project costs. It should be pointed out that the 15% of expenditure can include, not only construction costs, but all other development costs involved, including site acquisition costs and associated fees. It is felt that the 15% cost qualifying condition is not unduly onerous and will enable the vast majority of projects to qualify for the two year extension to the qualifying period of the scheme.</p>

A new action plan, entitled New Connections, was approved by Government in March 2002 covering the next three-year period 2003-05.

An overall amount of €138.7 million was allocated under the fund over the period 2000-02.

        <summary eId="sum_184">Regarding e-business, the following major initiatives are supported by the information society fund: Enterprise Ireland's Accelerator programme, a mentoring scheme for e-business targeting SMEs; city and county enterprise boards' Empower programme promoting e-business in micro-enterprises; and the Chambers of Commerce in Ireland e-business training initiative.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_185">In addition to the provision of on-line services and information on the Internet, a number of  important initiatives have been implemented under the information society fund at local and community level including: the provision of public internet access points at over 300 local libraries throughout the country; and, community based projects under the CAIT, community access to information technology, initiative co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs. To date, funding of €7.4 million has been committed to a total of 121 projects throughout the country since the launch of CAIT in December 2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">Funding beyond that provided by the information society fund has been made available for many other significant IT initiatives, for example, electronic voting, a range of new systems in the Department of Agriculture and Food, new systems for the Garda Síochána etc.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">I am satisfied that the investments made to date are already making a significant contribution to the development of the information society in Ireland and in positioning Ireland as a global leader in this area. Our progress has been recognised internationally in a number of studies and, under the recent European Commission's e-Europe benchmarking of e-government services, Ireland achieved first place in Europe reflecting the success of our strategy and the solid foundation available for further enhancing services to citizens and businesses.</summary>

It would be possible to introduce a second reduced rate under annex H of the sixth VAT directive as low as 5% for activities considered to be sporting activities. However, such a second reduced rate has not been introduced on the grounds of loss of revenue to the Exchequer from all the goods and services which would benefit from such a reduced rate. I have no plans, therefore, to make a change on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1801">At the end of September 2002, the total amount of money in the prize bond fund, that is, the total amount invested in the scheme, was €360 million. The net additional amounts invested in prize bonds in 2001 and 2000 were €35 million and €28 million respectively. The net additional amount invested in the period to end-September 2002 was €28 million. Encashments of prize bonds in 2001 and 2000 were €38 million and €41 million respectively. Encashments in the period to end-September 2002 totalled €32 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">With regard to the prizes schedule, there are weekly draws for prizes, held every Friday. A jackpot prize of €150,000 is awarded on the first Friday of each month and a top prize of €20,000 is awarded on each of the following Fridays of the month. The other prizes awarded in every draw are currently as follows – October 2002: five prizes of €1,000; ten prizes of €250; and 1,698 prizes of €75.</p>
          <p eId="para_1803">As the prize bond fund grows, additional prizes are added to the €75 category. The total value of the prizes awarded in the prize bond draws is equal to the interest payable on the amounts invested in the scheme, and the current interest rate is 2.75% per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1804">The number of unclaimed prizes at end-September 2002 was 5,114. This includes prizes going back to the late 1950s when the prize bond scheme commenced. To put the number of unclaimed prizes in perspective, the total number of prizes currently being paid out annually by the Prize Bond Company is just under 90,000, valued at about €8.5 million. The amount of unclaimed prize money at end-September 2002 was €1.06 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1805">The top winning numbers in every draw are available at post offices nationwide and the full draw results are displayed on the prize bonds website www.prizebonds.ie, and on page 699 of TV3's text service.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_189">The weekly draws are open to the public and all prizewinners are contacted by post to inform them of their win. For prizes in excess of €250, where the prize is then not claimed, reminders are sent out after three months and again after six months. When correspondence about a prize is returned marked "not known at this address",  the local post office is contacted to establish if the prizewinner has a forwarding address. Prizes unclaimed after the elapse of six months are placed in a special account in the Post Office Savings Bank, POSB, and earn interest at the standard POSB rates. When an unclaimed prize is eventually paid out, the interest accruing on it is added to the prize.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">The prize bond scheme is administered by the Prize Bond Company Limited as agent for the National Treasury Management Agency. The Prize Bond Company is a joint venture owned equally by An Post and FEXCO, Killorglin, County Kerry. All money invested in the scheme is passed to the NTMA. It is paid into the central fund, and forms part of the national debt.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_191">The prize bond scheme has enjoyed enormous success in recent years, with growth in the fund from €197 million at end-1997 to €360 million at end-September 2002 – an increase of over 80% in less than five years. A factor in this success has been the low interest rate environment generally which has enhanced the appeal of alternative savings products such as prize bonds.</summary>

      [20221/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_604">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1807">The general position is that income from assets, including deposit accounts, is taxable. DIRT is purely a collection method. Since its introduction in 1986, it has always been the case that DIRT is payable on bank interest, irrespective of the rate of inflation. Even if it were desirable to allow for the CPI effect, there would be major difficulties with the proposal suggested by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1808">Firstly, DIRT is deducted at source. If the Deputy's proposal was adopted it would necessitate a system which compares the consumer price index to interest payments in respect of every deposit account before deciding on DIRT liability. This would make the administration of this simple tax deduction much more complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_1809">Secondly, if the change sought by the Deputy was introduced, it may become possible for financial institutions to devise savings products in such a way as to reduce the tax payable, even when interest rates generally exceed inflation, simply by paying interest rates just under the consumer price index for the first years of the product, and paying a bonus on exit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1810">Thirdly, when the natural level of deposit interest rates offered are just above the rate of interest, the regime suggested by the Deputy may result in those rates being reduced in order to remove DIRT liability.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_192">DIRT is an important source of revenue, and the cost of removing it from Exchequer receipts  would be substantial. It is estimated that the yield from DIRT in 2002 will be about €210 million. If DIRT was not payable in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, it would be necessary to either increase other taxes, reduce spending, or increase borrowing by a substantial amount. I have accordingly no such plans to change the tax code as it relates to DIRT.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_1827">The Office of Public Works agreed to provide funding for the town council for a feasibility report on flooding in Arklow. That report was completed earlier this year and presented to the town council. The report contains a number of short-term recommendations for alleviating flooding in the town and also recommends implementation of a flood relief scheme. As all available funding is currently committed to other schemes, the Office of Public Works is not in a position to provide funding for a scheme in Arklow. This position may be reconsidered when the Estimates for 2003 are determined. The Office of Public Works has advised the town council that implementation and funding of the short-term recommendations of the feasibility report are a matter for the town council and/or the county council. The Office of Public Works will, of course, provide technical advice if required.</p>

Sectors such as primary health care, basic education, the provision of clean water and rural development receive priority attention. Full details of the Ireland Aid programme and the schemes administered under it, including a breakdown of projects funded through co-financing with NGOs, are available in the annual reports of the programme which are lodged with the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report, for 2001, was published last month.</p>

      the role of an organisation named AFrI; the objectives, rules and constitution of this organisation; the amount of State funding provided to this organisation; the purposes for which such funding is applied; and his views on whether this organisation requires State funding in view of the fact that this organisation has sufficient funds to erect false propaganda posters.

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_617">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1851">AFrI, by its own definition, is a non-govern mental organisation dedicated to advocacy on development issues with a special focus on the promotion of equity and justice in poorer countries. Details of its organisation and structure are available on its website at www.afri.buz.org. It would appear from this website that AFrI is now giving priority to advancing its concerns about what it perceives as the militarisation of Ireland through participation in NATO's PfP and a supposed European army. The Government regards these concerns as groundless. I regret that AFrI appears to be diluting its original vocation as a development organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1852">AFrI is among a number of organisations which have received assistance from the National Committee for Development Education, NCDE, as part of the promotion of development education in Ireland. The NCDE has received its budget from Ireland Aid, the Government's development aid programme. Over the past three years, AFrI has received grant assistance totalling approximately €78,000 from the NCDE. This year €35,500 has been committed to AFrI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1853">This funding has been granted in response to specific project proposals submitted by AFrI and approved by the NCDE, all of which related exclusively to the development education sector – in particular, activities which are designed to heighten awareness among target groups, e.g. secondary school teachers and students, youth group leaders and members of the general public, of the links between food insecurity and conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_1854">In addition to the above, a grant of £4,000, equivalent to €5,080, was paid in May 2001 to AFrI under Ireland Aid's NGO co-financing main scheme in respect of a project in which it was the Irish partner organisation. The funding was for the purchase of a computer and software for the San Jose de Aparatda Education Centre in Colombia and was approved as an appropriate basic education project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1855">The decisions taken in these instances were a matter for the NCDE, which judged that the development education projects submitted by AFrI satisfied its criteria for applications under this heading and approved support on this basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1856">In accordance with a recommendation made by the Ireland Aid review, which was accepted by the Government, the functions of the NCDE have recently been transferred to a dedicated development education unit within Ireland Aid as part of a process of integration between the NCDE and Ireland Aid.</p>

It also prohibits the extradition or expulsion of a person from the State where there are substantial grounds for believing that if the extradition or expulsion were to take place, the person may be subjected to torture.</p>

The current strategy statement – for 2001 to 2003 – sets out the Department's high-level policy goals and the detailed strategies and objectives to be pursued in order to achieve them.

It is fully funded by the Government, with a budget of €17.6 million in 2002. Last year, approximately 1,270 overseas personnel assignments were supported by APSO in 79 countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_2333">The current APSO strategic plan covers the period 1999-2003. Annual reports have been provided by APSO for each of the years since the current strategic plan was adopted. These reports outline the extent and nature of APSO's work, including evaluation. APSO was the subject of examination as part of the Ireland Aid review, published and approved by Government in March of this year, which judged that APSO had carried out very valuable work since its inception in 1973. It also concluded that, as a result of changing practices in development work and changing patterns of personnel supply, consideration needed to be given to the future of the organisation.</p>

Also arising from the review's recommendations, APSO will administer particular resources which are to be provided for the development work of Irish missionaries and will assist the missionaries in formulating and implementing a strategy for transition over the coming period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_211">The objective of the NCDE is to increase knowledge and understanding of development issues in Ireland. It promotes mainstreaming of development education, funds development education projects and undertakes research in development education. The NCDE publishes an annual review of its work and programmes which lists all grant-aided projects. Expenditure by the NCDE on development education in 2001 amounted to just over €2 million and almost 75% of this expenditure consisted of grants made to voluntary organisations and educational bodies for development education projects and research. The grants are monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis by the NCDE. The NCDE has also published and made available a wide range of development education materials for schools and the general public.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_212">An external review of the NCDE carried out in 2001 provided an overall positive appraisal of its work.

          <p eId="para_2335">The Government is actively responding to the growing food security crisis in the Horn of Africa region. Recent assessments by the United Nations' World Food Programme, WFP, and others have revealed widespread losses of maize and sorghum crops, the staple foods for most rural people in the region, due mainly to poor rainfall. As a consequence, over 12 million people are threatened with famine in the Horn of Africa. Coupled with the food security crisis already taking hold in the southern Africa region, the grim forecast is that more than 26 million African people will require food assistance over the next eight months.</p>
          <p eId="para_2336">Ireland Aid, the official aid programme of the Government, has delivered over €3.5 million in emergency humanitarian relief to the Horn of Africa region to date this year. In addition, on 22 October 2002, a special €1 million emergency food aid package for Ethiopia, the country worst affected in the region, was announced by the Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas development assistance, Deputy Tom Kitt. It is anticipated that this funding will be allocated in the coming weeks to key international agencies providing food assistance as well as Irish non-governmental organisations operating on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_2337">I would note that, in addition to emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is also delivering long-term development support to the region with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. In 2002, it is estimated that such support for the region will amount to €55 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2338">Ireland's financial support has been complemented by ongoing political action. On 17 July 2002, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met with Commissioner Poul Nielson in Brussels for discussions on the food crisis in Africa. Officials at the Irish Embassy in Addis Ababa, and at Ireland Aid in Dublin, are working closely with partners in the European Union and the United Nations to develop strategies on how immediate food needs across the Horn of Africa may best be addressed at both the national and regional levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_2347">On foot of applications for funding in respect of the Eurochild project, my Department issued a grant of £3,000 in October 2001 and a further grant of €5,000 in August 2002. The application for ongoing funding for the Eurochild project was given careful consideration by my officials. In considering the matter, my Department took account of the fact that a number of similar projects were already in operation in various locations. Unfortunately, in view of the range of similar projects taking place in Irish schools, it is not possible for my Department to provide ongoing funding for the Eurochild schools writing project.</p>

      further to Parliamentary Question No. 793 of 9 October 2002, the reason his Department will not address the career damage of technical schools' art teachers who qualified in 2002 with the NUI Diploma in Art Teaching, in view of the fact that his Department's stated position in 1974 was that the Department's TS art examination system through which these art teachers had attempted to qualify, was so seriously flawed that no art educationalist could stand over it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, these examinations continued to be held for a further 14 years. Teachers, who would otherwise have been regarded as unqualified, were, therefore, given the opportunity to achieve the necessary qualifications through the TS examinations system for a considerable period of time after the initial announcement that the arrangement was to be discontinued.</p>

The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school at present and by September 2003 will be a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best  practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">Guidelines were put in place in 1994 as an aid to schools in devising their individual anti-bullying strategies. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. The National Educational Psychological Service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties. I have no plans at present to carry out a review as suggested by Deputy Enright. However, I am very aware of the issue and my Department has moved to tackle this issue, as outlined previously.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2364">The release scheme to which the Deputy refers was introduced in the 2000-2001 school year to allow release time for principals in primary schools with six or less mainstream class teachers. The release time enables the teaching principal to be released for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions within the school. Substitution cover is paid by my Department in respect of these release days. The employment of the substitute teacher is a matter for the relevant school board of management.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_222">A number of initiatives have been undertaken by my Department in recent years to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the current supply difficulties. As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999, over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling  of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_223">The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-2002 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. Discussions with the colleges of education regarding a further post graduate course due to commence in early 2003 are currently taking place. My Department will also be consulting with the colleges in the near future with regard to the provision of modular type courses for secondary trained teachers with the necessary academic requirement in Irish.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_224">Between 2002 and 2003 it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. In addition to increasing the output of graduates other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications are now recognised as fully qualified.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_225">Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and, since September 2000, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the Higher Diploma in Education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_226">Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_229">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that for the current school year I have increased by two days the total number of release days available to principals in the different categories of school. The total number of days now allowable per school year are as follows: school with principal plus five or six teachers – 22 days; school with principal  plus three or four teachers – 18 days; school with principal plus zero, one or two teachers – 14 days. A circular outlining the details can be viewed on the website of my Department and it will be issued to all boards of management in the near future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2415">My Department established a task force on autism in October 2000 to draw up proposals for the future development of services for children with autism. The report of the task force on autism is lengthy and complex. It contains approximately 180 individual recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services, the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_2416">The scope of the task force's recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response.

          <p eId="para_2417">A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including persons with autism. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. I expect that a chief executive will be appointed to the council shortly and that the council will be vested and operational by the end of March 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_235">It is also my intention to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to copper-fasten the  rights and entitlement of persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The objective of this legislation, which will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, will be to provide a statutory guarantee of education services for persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The Bill will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children and adults, who because of disabilities have special educational needs and will propose to put in place a statutory structure, which will guarantee their education. Key provisions in the Bill will include: the establishment of a register of children with special needs, including persons with autism; the introduction of education plans tailored to the disabilities and educational needs of each individual; the involvement of parents in the planning and on-going review of their children's' education; the introduction of mediation and appeals structures to facilitate parents who are concerned at the adequacy of the provision being made available; the setting up of the national council for special education as a dedicated statutory body with responsibility for ensuring that the aims of the Bill are met; and the introduction of statutory duties on health boards to provide assistance and services necessary for the education of persons with special needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">Throughout the summer my Department has been involved in a comprehensive consultation process with interested parties in relation to the measures proposed in this legislation. The views expressed will be fully considered prior to finalisation of the draft Bill.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">I am satisfied that the development of the national council for special education, coupled with the legislative measures which I intend to bring forward as speedily as possible, will provide the basis on which the range of recommendations brought forward by the task force on autism can best be progressed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_238">In the meantime, I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to respond to the educational needs of children with autism. To date, in excess of 90 special dedicated classes have been established to cater for such children. Each class operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of two special needs assistants. Further support is provided where deemed necessary on the basis a professional assessment of needs.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2433">The Deputy is aware of the new programme – Giving Children An Even Break which was launched last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes – infants through second class – and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2434">Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2435">The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break. The school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the educational research centre survey outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_2436">Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. These representations, which include the school referred to by the Deputy, were referred to the educational research centre for consideration. My Department has now received a report from the educational research centre and the situation of this school is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome shortly.</p>

This budget includes provision for the following measures aimed at promoting participation at third level education by students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, by mature students and by students with disabilities: the special rates of maintenance grant for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as "top-up grants"; the fund for students with disabilities;  the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage and the student assistance-access fund.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2466">My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres. They are: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and (d) the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_245">The higher education grant scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under these Acts a  mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution. The Acts further provide,inter alia, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, do not exceed prescribed limits.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_246">Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. Similar provisions apply in relation to the other maintenance grant schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">Under the means test provisions of the schemes, the reckonable income of a candidate, other than an independent mature candidate, is his/her gross income from all sources, and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">A reduction in the age threshold defining mature student status under my Department's maintenance grants schemes would have to be considered in the light of available financial resources and other competing demands in the education sector. There are no plans at present to change the eligibility criteria in this regard.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2468">Up to October 1998, my Department's capacity to respond to individual children with special needs was dictated by resource availability. This changed with a Government decision in October 1998 whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_249">In October 1998, my Department for the first time recognised the distinct educational needs of children on the autistic spectrum. Prior to this decision, these children were placed in facilities catering for mild learning disabilities or emotional disturbance. Arising from this recognition, provision for children with autism is made available in dedicated special classes. Each special class caters for a maximum of six pupils. Each class operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and has the support of at least two special needs  assistants. More than 90 such classes have been established to date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_250">While my Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools, students who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes/units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. The number of special classes has grown from 350 to over 500 since 1998. Such facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio. These facilities also attract special rates of capitation funding which is at least three times the normal rate and can range from €363 for children with mild disabilities to €582.50 for children with severe disabilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_251">Children attending school on a fully integrated basis are supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. There were 104 resource posts at primary level in 1998. At present, there are in excess of 2,200 whole-time equivalent resource teachers supporting children with disabilities in ordinary primary schools at a cost of over €70 million per annum.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_252">There are currently in the region of 4,500 special needs assistants in place in primary schools supporting children with special educational needs on an integrated basis at a cost in excess of €95 million annually. The level of special need assistants has increased from less than 300 in 1998. Additional resource teachers and special needs assistants are being allocated by my Department on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_253">My Department allocates funding towards the provision of home based tuition to children who are too ill to attend school or as an interim measure while a suitable school placement is being sourced. The cost of providing this service has increased from €5.04 million in 1998 to the present level of over €10 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_254">Expenditure on the school escort service has grown from €190,000 to the current level of over €3 million since 1998. Funding for the special equipment needs of children with disabilities has also increased from €671,000 to €3.8 million during the same period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_255">The number of learning support teachers has grown from 1,242 to 1,531 since 1998 at an annual cost of approximately €53.6 million. These teachers address the literacy and numeracy difficulties experienced by pupils in primary schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_256">A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups  to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. I expect that a chief executive will be appointed to the council shortly and that the council will be vested and operational by the end of March 2003.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2472">My Department has agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduces the immediate impact on schools.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_257">As the Deputy is probably aware the money that has been transferred to this Department from FÁS has been used, in the main, to put in place a scheme of ancillary services grants for primary schools which are not already receiving grant aid for secretarial and caretaker services  under the 1978-79 scheme. Funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services has increased from the €50.79 per pupil that applied in the 2000/2001 school year, to the €102 per pupil that issued in March last to all eligible schools. In this regard, Scoil Chlocháin Mhuire Girls' national school has been issued with a grant of €20,808 for the calendar year 2002. I am sure that the Deputy will agree that these increases in the level of the ancillary services grant will be of benefit to the vast majority of primary schools. The transfer of the money to this Department from FÁS also ensures that this money will now be available to the primary school sector on an ongoing basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_258">I am aware however that the phasing out of CE schemes may result in some schools experiencing certain difficulties. In this regard, a sum of approximately €2.5 million has been set aside in 2002 to respond to the particular difficulties that may be experienced by some schools. My Department has engaged a firm of consultants to examine the transitional difficulties that may be experienced by schools loosing the CE personnel and to consider how those adverse effects might be ameliorated. All schools will shortly receive a questionnaire from the consultants. It will be open to Scoil Chlocháin Mhuire Girls' national school to make the consultants aware of their particular difficulties.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2478">The schools referred to by the Deputy currently share the services of a full-time learning support teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_2479">In 2000, as part of my Department's reading initiative, learning support guidelines were provided to all schools and were aimed at ensuring that all children achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy during the course of their primary education. The learning support guidelines recommend high levels of co-operation between class teachers, learning support teachers and parents in supporting children who are experiencing learning difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_2480">In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the 10th percentile. In order to allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher. The principal teacher has overall responsibility for the school's learning-support support programme and for the operation of services for children with special educational needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2481">In addition to learning-support teachers, my Department allocates resource teacher posts to cater for the educational needs of children assessed as having disabilities who have been fully integrated into mainstream national schools where there are no other adequate support teaching resources available to the children. I can assure the Deputy that the needs of Scoil Íde Naoife will be taken fully into account in the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available for allocation.</p>

In my response I indicated that my Department had put in place a range of supports for teachers and pupils in relation to the  introduction of the home economics syllabus. These included: support for individual teachers as requested at inservice; draft syllabus guidelines available at inservice; syllabus guidelines issued to schools; teachers' notes prepared for the national inservice days which are available on request from the support team and materials available on the support team website.</p>
          <p eId="para_2497">I also noted that the ATHE had consistently expressed its concerns over the last few years about the delay in implementing the revised home economics syllabus. I believe the association's concerns regarding the depth of treatment of common material in the new syllabus and the areas of practice can be overcome as a result of the range of supports outlined as well as the inservice planned for the next two years. I also noted that the association had expressed its disappointment when the proposed introduction in September 2001 was deferred for a further year. The revised home economics syllabus will be examined for the first time in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_2544">I received correspondence recently from home economics teachers in a number of schools in addition to the correspondence referred to by the Deputy concerning the introduction of the revised leaving certificate home economics syllabus.</p>
          <p eId="para_2545">The leaving certificate home economics – general – syllabus has been in existence since the majority of teachers in the system began their careers. The leaving certificate home economics – social and scientific – syllabus was introduced in the 1970s. Clearly, there are changes in society and in education that warrant a change in syllabus at this stage. The elements of the syllabus most in need of updating are in the area of food science and the legislation affecting food, resource management and social studies. Another change, much sought after by teachers who found the old syllabi very difficult to cover in the time available, is the reduction of the two old syllabi to one and the reduction of teaching time to 180 hours. This has been achieved by a streamlining of content and by the introduction of a strong element of choice. Perhaps the most important change from the point of view of quality of learning and teaching is the new emphasis on practical work in the revised syllabus. It is clear from the above that if schools were to continue to teach material that is now outdated and to use methods that are no longer helpful to learning, students would be increasingly badly served by the teaching offered to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_269">My Department has put in place a range of supports for school teachers and pupils in relation to the introduction of the home economics sylla bus. These include: support for individual teachers as requested at inservice, draft syllabus guidelines available at inservice, syllabus guidelines issued to schools, teachers' notes prepared for the national inservice days which are also available on request from the support team, and materials available on the support team website.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_270">The teachers' concerns regarding the depth of treatment of common material in the new syllabus and the areas of practice can be overcome as a result of the range of supports outlined as well as the inservice planned for the next two years. The revised syllabus will be examined for the first time in 2004.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2599">The modernisation programme for the public service sets out objectives for continuous improvement in service delivery, management of resources and organisational responsiveness. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness specified objectives to be achieved under the modernisation programme during the period of the programme. Department specific indicators were developed for the Department's modernisation programme and these were agreed through the Department's partnership committee. The Department submitted a final progress report to the Civil Service quality assurance group in June 2002 outlining the progress made in achieving the targets set. The Department also initiated an information and reporting process to extend the modernisation programme to the bodies under its aegis. The Civil Service quality assurance group decided that the progress achieved up to April 2002 met the requirements of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_2600">The Department's strategy statement sets out the objectives and programmes of the Department and progress is reported annually in the Department's annual report. The goals outlined in the strategy statement are incorporated into the business plans of each unit of the Department and performance indicators are set. The progress achieved in meeting the targets set in the current strategy statement for 2001 to 2004 will be included in the annual report for 2001 due to be published shortly. As the Deputy will be aware, a new strategy statement is now required to be put in place and work on this is progressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_2601">Institutions under the aegis of the Department developed performance indicators in a partnership process to measure the achievement of objectives in accordance with the requirements of the PPF. A quality assurance group for the education sector comprising management, trade union and customer-client representatives carried out an assessment of progress. The group concluded in its report that progress in achieving the objectives of the modernisation programme throughout the sector was commensurate with the requirements of the PPF.</p>

          <p eId="para_2604">The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2605">If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2606">Earlier this year my Department carried out a review of the operation of the special rates of maintenance grant. This review also has had the benefit of input from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Arising from the review, the criteria for the special rates were broadened significantly and a number of additional social welfare payments have been included as eligible payments for the purposes of the scheme. As disability benefit is considered to be a short-term payment, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purposes of the special rates of maintenance grant. It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the special rates of maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_2607">Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college.</p>

      asked the

      the most recent figures in relation to illiteracy and to functional illiteracy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_703">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2618">Traditional definitions of illiteracy as an absolute are generally not found useful by researchers. Most recently, researchers have adopted various measures of functional literacy  to determine the number of people with serious literacy problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_2619">A national assessment of English reading, with fifth class pupils, was carried out in May 1998. A sample of about 4,000 pupils in 150 schools was chosen so that findings could be used to make judgments about the reading achievements of fifth class pupils in Irish education. Comparisons were made with data obtained in a number of previous national assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2620">Based on the pupils' performance on a selection of items used in the reading tests, it was estimated from the 1993 survey that 6.5% to 9.5% of Irish 11 year old pupils had serious literacy difficulties. No change was found in the reading achievement levels of the lowest achieving pupils in the 1993 and the 1998 surveys. Thus, it can be inferred that in the region of 6.5% to 9.5% of 11 year old pupils in primary schools have serious literacy difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_2621">The results of the OECD PISA survey were published in December 2001. This was a survey of literacy, maths and science attainment levels of 15 year olds across 32 countries. While the maths and science results showed Ireland performing at about the OECD mean in science and maths, the results for reading literacy were particularly good, with Ireland ranked fifth out of all countries surveyed. Smaller proportions of Irish students achieved scores at the lowest levels of reading proficiency and larger proportions achieved scores at the highest levels, compared with the OECD country average proportions. Only 11% of students were found to be performing at or below the bottom literacy level level one or below, compared with an OECD country average of more than 17%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2622">The OECD international adult literacy survey was carried out in 1995 and published in 1997. This survey found that within the general population aged 16 to 64 years, some 500,000 adults or 25% scored at the bottom literacy level level one but that only 16 to 17% of those under 25 years old were performing at this level. Comparing these figures with the results of the more recent PISA survey, in which 11% of students were found to be at level one or below, it appears that the most recent measures of literacy achievement indicate a healthy upward trend in literacy levels, particularly among adolescents and young adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_2623">Improving literacy standards among all sectors of the population is and will continue to be a central policy focus of my Department. A national adult literacy strategy was identified as the top priority in adult education in the White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, published in 2000. Investment in the area has increased 16 fold since the OECD international adult literacy survey report was published, from just more than €1 million in 1997 to €16.46 million in the current year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_273">Since the adult literacy budget was increased, participation in VEC literacy schemes has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 22,733. In addition to this, two TV literacy tuition pro grammes shown over the last two years attracted average weekly audiences of 155,000 to 235,000 people per week in 2000 and 2001 respectively.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2625">A task force on the physical sciences was set up at the end of 2000 and reported in March 2002. The task force had 44 members nominated by a wide range of educational and industrial interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_2626">The report identified six action areas: planning and resources; equity, teaching and learning; curriculum and assessment; promotion of science; and transition and integration into third level. The total costing of the proposals within the task force report amounted to €178 million for capital expenditure and €66 million for annual recurrent expenditure. The report was circulated for consultation in April with submissions on the report invited up to 1 September. Some 30 submissions were received.</p>
          <p eId="para_2627">A group within the Department is working on developing a strategy that will address the recommendations of the task force and its funding implications. As some of the issues involved in addressing what needs to be done are outside the remit of the Department of Education and Science, the group has identified the required involvement of other Departments, particularly in relation to the resource implications. I await the recommendations of this group before making firm proposals in relation to further improvements in the provision for science education.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_292">The Government has considered a number of options for further extending the gas network into the north west, all of which would require very substantial grant aid, in excess of 85%.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2730">The alternative energy requirement programme, AER, is the support measure used by my Department to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources, including wind energy, to overall electricity production in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_2731">Since the programme was launched in 1995, five AER competitions have supported the development of alternative and renewable energy based electricity generating plant. Three of these competitions included a wind energy category.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_301">The published target for wind energy in AER I was 30 megawatts, MWs, and 46 MWs was built. In AER III the published target was 90 MW and 40 MW was built. A further five wind farms, with a total capacity of 16 MWs, supported under the European Commission's THERMIE programme, were awarded AER contracts and are in operation. In all 17 wind farms have become operational under the AER programme since its commencement in 1995.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_302">In February this year the results of the most recent competition, AER V, were announced. The published target was 240 MW. Due to the quality and volume of applications submitted and the need to provide for unforeseen project retirements the support was increased to 345 MW. These projects will typically build during 2003 or 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_303">Following the completion of AER III and prior to the launch of AER V a strategy group was established to report on impediments to the greater deployment of wind energy. The group concluded that a significant proportion of proposed projects in AER III failed to proceed due to subsequent failure in the planning process. The group therefore recommended that subsequent AER competitions should include planning consent as a condition of entry to the competition. This recommendation was incorporated into AER V.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_304">I am confident that AER V, confined to projects with planning consent, will more than deliver on the initial target. Overall, therefore, I am satisfied the AER programme, including the increased targets in each successive competition, is a successful intervention in the market to ensure the completion of projects which would not otherwise be built.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_305">It is my intention to announce a further competition, AER VI, shortly to deliver the overall demanding target of an additional 500 MW of new generating plant based on renewable energy technologies by 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_306">I have already indicated to the market that, following the launch of AER VI, I will commence a public consultation programme to gauge an appropriate target for subsequent years and to decide the most appropriate support mechanisms to be adopted.</summary>

The list was prepared following consultation with broadcasters, sports event organisers and the general public in accordance with the provisions of the 1999 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_2736">The Act also requires that a draft of the order designating the events must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a motion approving that order must be agreed by each House before the order can be formally made. In addition, under Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, Ireland is obliged to notify the European Commission of the measures Ireland intends to take in this regard with a view to the Commission verifying that the measures are compatible with Community law. I hope to complete the designation process at the earliest possible date.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2757">The provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market.</p>
          <p eId="para_2758">However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services due to lower population densities and lower concentrations of industries, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland and lower the cost differentials between the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2759">In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the rollout of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide to a value – both public and private funding – of €70 million were supported and are now completed. These projects entailed the rollout of broadband services in the border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.</p>
          <p eId="para_2760">Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the indicative figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was approximately €200 million. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_2761">A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_308">Of the projects selected under this call under the communications measure of the NDP 2000-2006, the Department will fund Esat-BT with up to €9 million to roll out a €25 million DSL programme at 40 centres outside of the Dublin area, including Waterford, by the end of the year. The Department is also funding ESBT with up to €16 million to install a national 48-fibre optic network linking major centres throughout the country, one of which is Waterford.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_309">The broadband programme announced in March will involve 20 projects, which will lead to the construction of metropolitan area fibre optic networks in towns, including Waterford, to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide "always on" low cost and high speed Internet access, which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, it will facilitate the provision of broadband services by a greater a number of operators and the ensuing competition should benefit the end users in these towns. The relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects in the order that the local authorities complete the procurement processes to the satisfaction of my Department. It is anticipated that this will take place over the coming months. It is expected that these projects will be completed by the end of next year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2782">Duneske Leisure Group submitted an application to my Department for funding under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme for 2002. Under this programme, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. The programme is advertised on an annual basis and provisional grant allocations for 2002 were announced on 29 March last. Unfortunately, the Duneske application was deemed ineligible on the grounds that its project did not have the minimum level of local funding required under the terms and conditions of the programme.</p>

It will be open to the Duneske group to apply for funding under the 2003 sports capital programme when it is advertised.

          <p eId="para_2810">The most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland: 1994 to 1998, Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, indicates there is evidence of a divergence between female incidence and mortality rates, with a significant upward trend in breast cancer incidence in women under 65 years and downward trends in mortality rates in all age groups combined. These findings may be the result of improvements in treatment and/or increased screening. There were no significant trends in incidence or mortality for women aged 65 and over. The clear margin between the incidence and mortality trends reflect the fact that survival from breast cancer is good. The National Cancer Registry reports that this divergence in the trends is expected to continue as a result of continuing improvements in treatments and also as a result of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2811">As the Deputy is aware, the programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To the end of August 2002, some 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%. I understand that BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_314">The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme be driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has recently submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is currently discussing the business plan with the board of BreastCheck and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic breast disease services. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services for 2003. As the Deputy is aware, any woman irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate con cerns or symptoms, should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_315">In relation to cancer services generally, since the publication of the national cancer strategy in 1996, over €103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff. This year a total of €27.3 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services. This includes the provision of €23.55 million which was allocated between all health boards for the continuing development of oncology services, including funding for oncology drug treatments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_316">In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003-2010 is currently being prepared by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert review group on radiotherapy services. The forum is currently in discussions with the ERHA and all health boards in relation to the future development of cancer services, including how best to organise these services.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2815">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the availability of traditional, alternative and herbal medicinal products. I would like to inform the Deputy that my Department is not seeking to restrict availability of these medicinal products, other than in cases where there may be overriding public health considerations. On the contrary, in order to seek to ensure the continued availability of such products that are of appropriate quality and safety, my Department is currently examining proposals from the Irish Medicines Board for the control of these products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional medicinal products, which they buy, are: produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the recommended conditions of use; can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use; and are appropriately labelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_2816">In order to gain the most from these types of medicinal products, it is essential that they be controlled by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicinal products, they are of an appropriate quality and safe for the consumer to use. The interests of public health can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for the assessment of these products and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to assure their continued safety in use.</p>
          <p eId="para_2817">The Deputy should be aware that a proposed EU Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products was agreed by the European Commission on 17 January 2002. This proposal has now been sent to the European Parliament and Council. I understand the Irish Medicines Board's proposal for an interim national control scheme for these products is broadly in line with the proposed EU Directive. Both the Irish Medicines Board's proposal and the proposed EU directive are currently being examined in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2818">The Deputy may also be interested to know that, at my request, the Irish Medicines Board organised a seminar for interested parties to review the implications of its proposed scheme for the control of these products. This seminar was held in May and proved to be a useful and constructive exercise, which facilitated the exchange of information and opinions. I have also received a number of representations from various interested parties, including members of the public, all of which will be considered in the context of our ongoing examination of the IMB proposed scheme of control and the proposed EU Directive.</p>

          <p eId="para_2822">I propose to take Questions Nos. 483, 538 and 573 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2823">Section 47 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act, 2002, empowers the Minister for Health and Children to prohibit or restrict the smoking of tobacco products in many public places, including licensed premises and train services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2824">With regard to licensed premises, current regulations only ban smoking in food preparation areas. A small number of pubs have introduced dedicated non-smoking areas on a voluntary basis. While this is welcome, I have made it clear to representatives of the licensed trade when meeting them that much more needs to be done to afford the necessary level of protection from environmental tobacco smoke. It is reasonable to extend environmental controls on smoking to include pubs to ensure protection for the public and for staff from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Draft regulations are being prepared in my Department, which will include environmental controls on smoking in pubs. When these are completed further consultations will take place with the licensed trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_2825">With regard to smoking on train services, smoking is currently prohibited on the DART service and on all Arrow trains operated by Iarnród Éireann. On all other train services operated solely by Iarnród Éireann smoking is prohibited in at least two-thirds of the seating area. The Enterprise train service between Dublin and Belfast, which is operated jointly by Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways, is completely non-smoking. Extending environmental controls on smoking to all train services is under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_2826">It is my intention to introduce the necessary regulations as soon as possible, but at this stage I cannot give an exact date.</p>

          <p eId="para_2839">As the Deputy is aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No 3) Act, 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_2840">The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. This solution involves the payment of enhanced subventions on quite a significant scale.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_317">In 1997, the funding available for the scheme was £27 million (€34.3 million), in 2001, the sum was £52 million (€66.03 million) and in 2002 the  funding available is €101.4 million. In recognition of the issues involved, my Department made significant additional resources of over £1.2 million (€1.52 million) available to the Southern Health Board at the end of 2001. Furthermore, the Southern Health Board received an additional €4.24 million this year including a sum of €2.64 million to respond to extra pressures on the scheme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2850">The overall objective of the Government's strategy in relation to drug misuse is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. With regard to treatment the objective is to provide a range of options to encourage and enable drug misusers to avail of treatment with the aim of reducing dependency and improving overall health and social well-being, with the ultimate aim of leading a drug-free lifestyle. This approach incorporates a broad range of activities which are the hallmarks of modern drugs strategies in other jurisdictions.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_319">Methadone maintenance is internationally recognised as a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the drug problem. It has  also been shown that it is possible to reduce the anti-social behaviour of intravenous drug users by taking them into treatment on methadone maintenance programmes. Internationally, there is a well-established research and a clinical evidence base for substitution treatment with methadone. On average, methadone maintenance is associated with lower rates of heroin consumption, reduced levels of crime and improved social functioning. A lower risk of premature mortality amongst maintained patients has been reported and substitution programmes have also contributed to the prevention of the spread of HIV infection.</summary>

Within the school system, such children are generally catered for in special dedicated classes.

Additional special needs assistant support can be provided where deemed necessary on the basis of professionally assessed needs. In excess of 90 such classes have been established to date.

This investment facilitated the development of a range of services including residential, respite, day and home support services, health related support services for children and specialist support services. Further additional revenue funding of €25 million was provided in 2002 to continue the expansion of these services. My Department is also working with the health boards to improve the level of information available on the needs of this group, including the development of an information system which will provide specific information on the needs of persons with autism, similar to that provided by the national intellectual disability database.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2907">A national anti-bullying policy for the health service was agreed in 1999 as a partnership initiative involving health service employers and staff representative bodies. It details the procedures, both informal and formal, for dealing with complaints of bullying in the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_2908">The Deputy may wish to note that this policy is currently under review by a working group comprising representatives of health service employers and staff representative bodies. It has been agreed by the working group that the policy should be developed into a dignity at work policy to encompass sexual harassment and harassment as prohibited under the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The proposed dignity at work policy will also incorporate appropriate best practice drawn from the following codes of practice which issued earlier this year: the Health and Safety Authority's prevention of workplace bullying; the Labour Relations Commission's procedures for addressing bullying in the workplace; and the Equality Authority's sexual harassment and harassment at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_2909">It is intended that the dignity at work policy will focus on the prevention of bullying and harassment at work by creating a workplace environment that respects the dignity of all staff. The policy will contain definitions of bullying and sexual harassment and also indicate the range and types of behaviour that could constitute bullying/harassment. The policy will also include revised procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment, having regard to current best practice and the experience of health service employers in dealing with such complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_2910">It is also intended that the working group will make recommendations on appropriate education and training initiatives to ensure that the dignity at work policy is fully implemented throughout individual employing authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_2917">In September 2000, a bidding process involving health agencies was initiated by my Department for the provision of increased psychology training places in response to the recommendations of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services. Given the urgency of providing the additional training places, all the increased training places were allocated to the Psychological Society of Ireland's – PSI – postgraduate diploma course for a period of three years since the other existing training providers were not in a position at that time to provide the places within the required timeframe. Funding was allocated in November 2001 to the successful applicants for the creation of 30 trainee clinical psychologist posts and also for the payment of course fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_2918">In August, 2002 the Northern Area Health Board applied for additional funding to be made available to support the provision of six extra places on the TCD programme. As the substantial funding allocated by my Department, currently supporting the extra 30 PSI training places, has been distributed to those agencies who participated in the bidding process in 2000, this request is being examined in the context of the 2003 funding position. My Department is continuing to work with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to ensure adequate provision of training places consistent with the human resource requirements of the health services.</p>

          <p eId="para_2929">One of the key goals of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, is concerned with making sure that equal access for equal need is a care value for the delivering of publicly funded services. Access in terms of timing and geographical location are also embraced by this goal. Since 1997, over €103 million has been invested in development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Amongst a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts throughout the country in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_2930">This year a total of €27.3 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services. This includes the provision of €23.55 million which was allocated between all health boards for the continuing development of oncology services, including funding for oncology drug treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2931">In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003-2010 is currently being prepared by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert review group on radiotherapy services. The forum is currently in discussions with the ERHA and all health boards in relation to the future development of cancer services, including how best to organise these services.</p>

          <p eId="para_2934">The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that at the end of March 2002, there were 19 whole time equivalent, WTE, specialists in orthodontics employed by the health boards. In line with the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on the service, the number of specialist in orthodontics posts for the health boards is being finalised. This process will yield any additional national manpower requirements for the public orthodontic service.</p>
          <p eId="para_2935">Furthermore, I have already taken a range of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_2936">This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_2937">The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by cooperation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2938">These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_329">In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic Initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an Initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health  boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_330">Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_331">The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, there were 19,055 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,760 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</summary>

The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert review group on radiotherapy services. The forum is currently in discussions with the ERHA and all health boards in relation to the future development of cancer services, including how best to organise these services.</p>

      his plans to establish a State funded guardian ad litem service in accordance with the recommendations set out in the report by the guardian ad litem group of May 2001, entitled Giving Children a Voice; when such a State-funded service will established; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the continued failure to have a State-funded independent guardian ad litem service is in breach of a number of international treaties; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that there are a number of children who urgently require the services of such a service in the courts but who currently do not have one; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3005">I am aware of the recommendations in the report of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>group and of the difficulties identified by the group with the operation of the existing system, and I am conscious of the position regarding the current availability of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>service. The question of establishing a State funded service is one of a number of issues to be addressed in the context of a review of the existing service which is being undertaken by the national children's office. The need to review the operation of the existing service was highlighted in the Government's national children's strategy. The national children's strategy is a major initiative to improve the quality of all children's lives over the next eight years.</p>
          <p eId="para_3006">The National Children's Office is currently finalising a request for tenders document inviting tenders from interested parties to undertake the review. The review will be wide ranging and will involve consultation with interested parties in both the voluntary and statutory sectors, including health board personnel, the social services inspectorate, the Judiciary and the Law Society. Among the other issues to be examined as part of the review will be:</p>
          <p eId="para_3007">(i) the management and organisation of the present service, including selection and vetting procedures;</p>
          <p eId="para_3008">(ii) the difficulties being experienced with the current system and issues relating to the need for national standards;</p>
          <p eId="para_3009">(iii) the need for detailed guidelines on the appointment, role, function and powers of a guardian <i>ad litem </i>in public and private law proceedings and the ethical and professional standards required of them;</p>

          <p eId="para_3021">The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_3022">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_343">This year my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universit ies in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_344">The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_345">In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.  Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</summary>

This is an increase of 1,760 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect. For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives and structural changes that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times for treatment and positively impact on the future delivery of orthodontic services in the longer term.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_3131">I propose to take Questions Nos. 549 and 550 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3132">My Department is committed to the use of performance indicators as a means of managing its work. The health strategy "Quality and Fairness" outlines the largest expansion in services in the history of the Irish health system. A vision has been set out across the full range of care areas for how the system can develop not just in the short-term but over the next decade to deliver high quality care for all. The strategy sets out four goals which encompass the major conclusions from the strategy consultation process and analysis in terms of overall direction for the future:</p>
          <p eId="para_3133">– Better health for everyone</p>
          <p eId="para_3134">– Fair access</p>
          <p eId="para_3135">– Responsive and appropriate care delivery</p>
          <p eId="para_3136">– High performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_3137">These are in turn broken down into 12 specific objectives. The strategy's action plan translates these objectives into 121 clear, achievable tasks, complete with target dates and allocation of responsibility. In line with the commitment given in "Quality and Fairness", I have established a strategy implementation unit in my Department to drive implementation of the strategy at national level.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_355">The strategy implementation team has responsibility for the preparation of an annual report for the Cabinet sub-committee on implementation of the strategy and is currently engaged in compiling the necessary information  for preparation of this important report. I expect to report to the Cabinet sub-committee before the end of the year. I also intend to produce an end of year report showing those areas where progress on the implementation of the health strategy has been made and I will provide a copy of this report to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_356">The Deputy may also wish to note that I am reconvening the National Consultative Forum on 11 November this year to consider progress reports on the implementation of the strategy and to comment on priorities in the light of progress and emerging trends. Performance indicators are an integral part of the Department's business plan and are used in reviews of progress as part of the managerial process. Copies of the 2001 and 2002 business plans are available on the Department's website.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_357">My Department is currently preparing its statement of strategy for 2003-05 as are all other Departments in line with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. This statement will contain key performance indicators which will be reported against in future annual progress reports. Performance indicators also feature in the performance management and development system which is currently being embedded in the Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_358">Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a set of performance indicators was devised to measure progress in relation to modernisation objectives and payment of the final 4% of the pay award was linked to satisfactory progress on these indicators. The indicators for the Department of Health and Children were agreed by the Civil Service quality assurance group which was set up under the PPF to monitor progress. The Department submitted a report in May 2002 to the Civil Service quality assurance group. Progress was deemed to have been satisfactory and the final 4% was awarded to departmental staff as a result.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_359">The agencies which my Department funds use a range of performance indicators. The key performance indicators are those which are under development jointly by the health boardsauthority and my Department in relation to the annual health board-authority service plans. These performance indicators set out to cover five domains, effectiveness, efficiency, health improvement, equity-access and service user satisfaction-experience and are used by both my Department and the health boards-authority in relation to service plans.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_360">Because these joint performance indicators are developmental in nature and have only been instituted in the past two years it is not possible to provide a report on performance in respect of the past five years. In addition at the present stage in the development of this set of key performance indicators data definition and data quality issues have yet to be adequately resolved to allow for the publication of a worthwhile commentary by health boards effectively linking them to objectives and activities. With regard to other  agencies which my Department funds I am having the information on relevant key performance indicators collated and will respond to the Deputy as soon as possible.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3203">The Government decision to extend automatic medical card eligibility to all persons aged 70 and over with effect from 1 July 2001 was announced on budget day in December 2000. The measure was subsequently unanimously approved by this House. It was originally estimated that 39,000 persons would benefit from the initiative. This was based on the CSO estimate of persons aged 70 and over in the State less the number in that age category already registered as medical cardholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_3204">However, it subsequently came to light that the health board-GMS databases of medical cardholders in the over 70s age category were inaccurate. Following a targeted review by health boards of medical card lists for the over 70s, in excess of 15,200 duplicate entries and entries for deceased persons have so far been removed from those lists. My Department has now requested the chief executive officers of the health boards to arrange for an immediate full review of the entire GMS list for their functional areas, to be completed by the end of the year. They have also been requested to put in place an effective pro-active management system so as to ensure that the lists are accurate in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_3205">The effect of this cleansing exercise on participating GMS doctors will be to cease inappropriate payments to them in respect of patients for whom they no longer have responsibility.

          <p eId="para_3207">The post mortem inquiry commenced work in March 2001 at which time it was envisaged that it would take approximately 18 months to complete its task i.e. by September 2002. I met the chairman, Anne Dunne, senior counsel, in early September and she informed me that she still had a substantial amount of work to undertake. I requested a progress report from her at that stage and she provided this to me on 2 October last.</p>
          <p eId="para_3208">The report shows, for example, that while oral submissions have been heard from 78 parents-next of kin, a further 328 parents-next of kin have yet to be heard. Having regard to the amount of work that remains to be undertaken by the inquiry, I do not expect the final report to be available for some considerable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_3209">I believe that the only way in which the timescale can be shortened, while at the same time guaranteeing that a comprehensive report is produced, is to give the inquiry a much sharper focus in consultation with Parents for Justice and other relevant parties.

        <summary eId="sum_547">I recently established the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board which will have responsibility for the administration and implementation of a quality assurance framework in respect of the hospital sector. Accreditation is an internationally recognised process which combines self-assessment and external peer review of an organisation's performance against a series of predetermined standards. The objective is to encourage health agencies to focus on ways to continuously improve the health care delivery system. The Irish scheme is designed to be  patient-focused, promote continuous quality improvement and safety, and to be independent, voluntary, authoritative and achieve international recognition. I am confident that the scheme will allow for real and measurable improvement in standards across the hospital system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3215">The health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. As part of the preparatory work for the strategy my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of the subsequent report entitled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_3216">In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of €65 million. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 272 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards indicates that in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_3218">The question asked by the Deputy relates to two distinctly separate issues. Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council is the body statutorily charged with the registration of medical practitioners. In order to ensure patient care and safety it is necessary for the council to be absolutely certain of the suitability of a medical practitioner to be registered. In order to  do this the Medical Council must satisfy itself as to the qualifications and good standing of any applicant for registration. Although it is regrettable that certain asylum seekers cannot provide the required documentary evidence of their qualifications and good standing, the council must insist on the provision of appropriate evidence that these requirements are met in the interests of patient safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_3219">I understand from the Medical Council that it is currently dealing with two such applications from persons seeking asylum in Ireland, which cannot be processed due to non-receipt of confirmation that the doctors in question are in good standing. The Medical Council has advised me that it is also dealing with another from a person seeking asylum in Austria, and is awaiting verification of documentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3220">The second part of the Deputy's question relates to the Medical Practitioner's (Amendment) Act, 2002, enacted in May 2002, and the draft rules to be prepared by the Medical Council in this regard. The amendment Act and the rules relate primarily to medical practitioners who are temporarily registered and who wish to apply for full registration. These rules are currently being finalised. However, the Deputy should be aware that implementation of the new rules will not affect the position of doctors in this situation.</p>

The main purpose of the RTI, which is due to run until end 2003, is to promote the development of a range of innovative pilot community based public transport projects in rural areas. It is being managed and monitored by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department and to date eight community transport groups have received funding for transport operations. Projects from a further 17 groups have just been assessed by ADM for operational funding and these projects are expected to proceed shortly in a number of counties. Some €3 million will be spent on the initiative this year and a similar amount in 2003.</summary>

I expect to be presented with the committee's findings before the end of the year.</summary>

The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost €130 million, is a 25,000 square metre terminal building. Planning permission for this project was secured earlier this year and Aer Rianta is currently evaluating tenders for the works. The company expects that the work will take two years to complete and the aim would be to have the new terminal ready for Cork's year as European City of Culture in 2005. I have made it clear that this project will proceed, whatever the outcome of my current examination of options for greater autonomy for Cork airport.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3276">The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development: it is proposed that €1 billion investment in national road improvements under the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing based on user tolls.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_556">User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in  major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_557">Toll-financed road PPPs will attract private sector funding and aim to ensure earlier delivery of badly needed national roads infrastructure. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_558">As regards the system of tolling to be used, I have already publicly stated that my policy is one of using a method that utilizes the most up-to-date electronic technology to ensure that there is a rapid movement of traffic and traffic tailbacks are eliminated. I have discussed the need to incorporate the electronic tolling system on all proposed toll roads with the National Roads Authority and I intend to continue these discussions over the coming months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_559">I am confident that the modest level of the tolls to be charged, combined with the high quality of the new roads and the greatly improved transport service they will provide, will ensure that the routes are attractive to the vast bulk of inter-urban traffic.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_560">The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under part V of the Roads Act, 1993 – as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. Toll charges are determined in accordance with procedures contained in the Roads Act, 1993 which provide for public display or consultation of proposals to apply tolls and the holding of public oral hearings in the event of objections being made on toll scheme proposals.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Crawford</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the serious damage being carried out to business property and to the fact that elderly people living on Main Street, Cootehill, County Cavan, are being terrorised on a regular basis; if sufficient personnel will be made available based in Cootehill on a twenty-four hour basis, especially at the weekends, in order that business people and private owners can continue to live and work in their own town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3292">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the main concentration of entertainment venues, licensed premises, hackney shops and fast food outlets are located in Main Street, Cootehill, which is a mixed commercial and residential area. I am further informed that at the weekends the town attracts up to 2,000 extra patrons on Friday and Saturday nights and up to 700 on Sundays. Most of them are young people who socialise there. Exemptions are granted for night clubs up to 1.30 a.m. on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights and with a drinking-up period of 30 minutes, large numbers of revellers emerge from entertainment venues after 2.00 a.m. Many of these persons remain in the streets in the vicinity of hackney ranks and fast food outlets until 4.00 a.m. while awaiting transport. By the nature of such gatherings, considerable high-spirited conversation, horseplay and boisterousness prevail. However, while many have consumed various quantities of alcohol, the vast majority of persons are law abiding.</p>
          <p eId="para_3293">With regard to the number of Garda personnel, I am informed that the current strength of Cootehill Garda Station is eight – all ranks. When Cootehill Garda Station is not open to the public, PACB and call diversion systems are in operation and linked to the district headquarters at Bailieboro. Local Garda management is satisfied that the current opening hours of Cootehill Garda Station are adequate to meet the present the present policing needs of the sub-district. I am further informed that the extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoors administrative duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_3294">As the Deputy will appreciate, such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a more visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. I am also informed that two community alert schemes are in operation in the area and that every opportunity is availed of by gardaí to offer crime prevention advice to business people and the elderly. I am informed that local Garda management are satisfied that there are sufficient personnel in Cootehill to adequately police the area. I am assured that the situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next becomes available the needs of Cootehill will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>

      <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      the number of awards and the value of awards that have been made under equality legislation, employment equality and equal status Acts, in each year since they became operable; if his attention has been drawn to the change in revenue practice whereby they seek to tax the compensation payments for wrong done as if it were income from employment; and if this accords with the aims and spirit of the Acts.

          <p eId="para_3296">The Employment Equality Act 1998, which replaced the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act 1974 and the Employment Equality Act 1977, prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine distinct grounds namely gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Equal Status Act, 2000 prohibits discrimination in relation to the provision of goods and services on the same nine grounds.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_562">The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations (ODEI – the equality tribunal) provides the avenue of redress in the first instance, in  respect of claims of discrimination under employment equality legislation, other than claims in relation to dismissal which are referred in the first instance to the Labour Court. In addition, cases under the gender ground may be referred directly to the Circuit Court for adjudication. The ODEI also provides the avenue of redress for equal status cases, other than those involving registered clubs. Where a complaint of discrimination is upheld, the ODEI may order redress including the award of compensation for the effect of the discrimination payable by the respondent to the complainant.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_563">The number and value of awards made by the ODEI in the period from 18 October 1999 – the date of the commencement of the 1998 Act and the establishment of the ODEI – to 30 September 2002 under the equality legislation is shown in the following table. Decisions of the ODEI may be appealed to the Labour Court in employment cases and the Circuit Court in equal status cases. The amounts of compensation awarded may be affirmed, varied or overturned on appeal.</summary>

The position in relation to awards under employment equality legislation is set out in the reply by the Minister for Finance of 15 October 2002 in relation to compensation payments. As indicated by the Minister for Finance, while the facts of each case must be examined to determine whether a specific award is taxable or not, in general, awards granted under the employment equality legislation are taxable. The position in relation to taxation of employment equality awards was brought to the attention of my Department in 2001. However, taxation is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the question is more properly directed to the Minister for Finance.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3366">In addition to accommodating, in the main, young males from the Munster area, Fort Mitchel place of detention has traditionally been used to accommodate prisoners initially committed to Cork Prison, Limerick Prison and St. Patrick's Institution when these institutions are at or near full capacity. When this happens, prisoner transfers to Fort Mitchel are arranged to alleviate the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3367">At present, the three committal institutions to which I referred are, taken together, operating at slightly below full capacity and it is not necessary to arrange such transfers. Accordingly, the number of prisoners currently detained in Fort Mitchel is below full capacity. The number of persons committed to prison is cyclical in nature and it is anticipated that, as the current court sittings proceed, the number of prisoners in custody will increase and there will be a consequential rise in the number of prisoners detained at Fort Mitchel. While my Department has examined the feasibility of building a causeway to Spike Island, there are no plans at present to proceed with such a project. Nor are there plans at present to downgrade this facility.</p>

          <p eId="para_3378">I acknowledged in response to a similar parliamentary question by the Deputy on 9 October last that there may be some symbolic value in the idea that assets which are determined by law to be the proceeds of crime be committed towards anti-drugs and related programmes. However, I emphasised too that the proposal is not without significant difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_3379">These include the fact that, for example, it would involve a significant departure from Government accounting principles which provide that it is a matter for the Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to determine the optimum allocation of Exchequer receipts in accordance with agreed priorities. Any departure from such principles could set a precedent which would be difficult to resist in those circumstances and which, no doubt, would reactivate long standing demands for ringfencing receipts in other sectoral areas. It is true also that Government support, particularly in communities hardest hit by drugs, has been significant in recent years for drug related initiatives, mostly relating to recreation and local development. The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 builds on this experience and sets out a series of specific objectives and actions to address gaps identified in the strategy consultation process. There are legal difficulties too and my Department is continuing to examine all of these issues in consultation with other concerned Departments, including the Department of Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_3488">The current position is that all ranks within the Garda Síochána up to chief superintendent are eligible for a pension if they have a minimum 30 years service and have reached the age of 50 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_3489">Members of ranks up to and including inspector must retire at 57 years of age. Superintendents and chief superintendents must retire at 60 years of age as must those of commissioner rank appointed after 1996. Assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners appointed before 1996 must retire at 65 years of age. The age differential was established some time ago and recognises that there are greater physical demands on gardaí in front-line operational policing roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_3490">The commission on public service pensions has recommended that the minimum retirement age for new entrants to the Garda Síochána should be raised from 50 to 55 and that members should have the option of being retained to a maximum age of 60 rather than 57, subject to meeting minimum health and fitness standards. My objective is to have a fit, active and experienced force with an appropriate balance as regards the age profile and I am reviewing the retirement ages applicable to the Garda Síochána with this aim in mind.</p>

The person to whom the Deputy refers and her two children, arrived in the State on 6 February, 2000. The mother of the family concerned completed an asylum application on 7 February 2000. Her application was treated as one which also covered her two children. She received an interview and her case was considered by appropriately trained staff of the refugee applications commissioner. The commissioner recommended that her application should be refused on 29 June 2001. She appealed this refusal. She had the benefit of an oral hearing and engaged her own legal representation at that hearing which was conducted by a member of the refugee appeals tribunal, appointed as an independent authority to consider such appeals. The tribunal recommended that her appeal should be rejected on 10 January 2002. All of the refugee determination processes have been fully documented and are on file.</p>
          <p eId="para_3509">Her asylum application was finally refused on 28 February, 2002. In the notice of this refusal, the person concerned was given three options as required under the Immigration Act, 1999. These were, to make representations in writing as to why she should be allowed to remain in the State, to leave the State before a deportation order was made and to consent to the making of a deportation order. The person concerned made representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, which were submitted to me by solicitors acting on her behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_3510">I am not a further point of appeal against refusal of refugee status. My specific role is clearly set out in section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. I considered all the circumstances in this case with reference to the criteria specified in section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, which includes the family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. I also considered the matter of refoulement in accordance with section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996. I made deportation orders in respect of each of the family members on 2 July 2002 and am satisfied that this was the correct decision.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_584">The enforcement of deportation orders is a matter for the Garda national immigration bureau. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that for the purpose of giving effect to the orders in this case, three members of the Garda national immigration bureau visited the  address at which the family concerned were residing on the morning of 8 October. The mother of the children was not present when the members, all of whom were plain clothes and two of whom were female, called. They established from the other occupants of the house that the children's mother had gone to work. I am informed that the members left the residence having spent an aggregate of less than 50 minutes there. I am also informed that the children were in the exclusive company of the two female members for less than 30 minutes in total. The assertion that the two girls were interviewed for almost two hours alone in a room is incorrect. The assertion that their parent was not allowed to visit them is neither correct nor relevant as she was neither present nor contactable at that time. I am further informed that when the members returned to the residence on the evening of 8 October to make further inquiries in this matter, they were informed that the family had left without leaving a forwarding address.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_585">A very recent development in this matter is that the legal representatives of the family concerned have requested my consent, pursuant to section 17 (7) of the Refugee Act, 1996, to make a further application for a declaration of refugee status on foot of new information available. I will give full consideration to this request.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_586">I wish to assure the Deputy that in the course of originally deciding to make deportation orders in this case, I took account of the overall situation in Kosovo, which has greatly improved for persons returning there.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3517">As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for the general policy on intoxicating liquor legislation. In this regard, the legislation on intoxicating liquor already contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking. The primary purpose of these provisions is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol or to consume it.</p>
          <p eId="para_3518">The main legislative provisions relating to under-age drinking are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. The Act of 2000 provides for considerable strengthening of those provisions which already existed in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to underage persons, including increases in fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of a licensed premises, can result where a licensee is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under-age person. In this regard, a total of 118 closure orders in respect of licensed premises have been made since the 2000 Act came into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_3519">It should be noted that in regard to offences relating to underage drinking, the only defence permitted under the current legislation is the production of an age card. Under the national age card scheme, any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his-her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The use of age cards is widespread, the most recent figures available to me indicate that the Garda has issued over 80,000 age cards to date.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_587">It should be noted that the Garda already has extensive powers under existing legislation to address the problems associated with excessive drinking, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, which I reintroduced on Second Stage in Dáil Éireann on 19 June last, will give the  Garda significant additional powers in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_588">Regarding the health and education aspects of intoxicating liquor, these issues come within the ambit of my colleagues Deputy Martin, Minister for Health and Children and Deputy Dempsey, Minister for Education and Science, who is responsible for education matters relating to intoxicating liquor and young people, within his Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_589">While legislative measures, together with initiatives such as an age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of underage drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the underage drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone. In reality, it falls on all parties with an interest in this area, the drinks industry, the media, politicians, teachers and in particular, parents, to play their part in helping to address the problem of alcohol abuse, with special regard to young people.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3531">In cases such as this, where the person is seeking the return of her three children wrongfully removed to another State, the central authorities under the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction have certain specified functions. These include initiation of arrangements for the tracing of a child who is wrongfully removed to or retained in another state; to seek the child's return; the institution of judicial or administrative arrangements for the return of the child to his or her place of habitual residence; and the provision of legal aid and advice to the applicant parent to secure the return of the child.

          <p eId="para_3533">The case referred to by the Deputy is the subject of an application to the Irish central authority. The application was forwarded under the Hague Convention to the central authority for the United States on 30 August 2002.

The central authority endeavoured to contact the applicant by telephone to convey this information but received no response. The central authority telephoned the central authority in the US and received confirmation that this information would be conveyed to the applicant should they be contacted directly by the applicant.</p>

In most cases these matters are dealt with before the court in the foreign jurisdiction by way of affidavit evidence only and all necessary supporting information is provided to the applicant's legal team through the central authority network. It never had been the practice of the central authority to pay the travelling expenses incurred by an individual in travelling to another jurisdiction for the purposes of attending a court hearing concerning an application under the Hague Convention. Article 26 of the convention provides that the judicial or administrative authorities may, where appropriate, direct the person who removed or retained the child to pay necessary expenses incurred by or on behalf of the applicant, including travelling expenses, any costs incurred or payments made for locating the child, the costs of legal representation of the applicant, and those of returning the child. It is open to the applicant in  this case to seek to obtain such a direction from the court dealing with the application.</summary>

Planning for the installation of the CCTV systems in the remaining seven areas is also scheduled to commence in 2003.</p>

It was envisaged that the cost of purchasing, installing and maintaining the system would be borne by the council and the local business people. This proposal has been forwarded to the advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for CCTV systems, for consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_3555">A person whose father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of his-her birth is an Irish citizen from birth. A person whose grandparent was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the foreign births register at an Irish embassy or consular office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs. A person whose great-grandparent was born in Ireland may register in certain circumstances. Further information in this regard may be obtained from consular section, Department of Foreign Affairs, Hainault House, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, or from any Irish embassy or consular office.</p>
          <p eId="para_3556">A person is entitled to make a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship if he-she is married to an Irish citizen – who is Irish other than by naturalisation, post-nuptial citizenship or honorary citizenship – for at least three years. The marriage must be valid and subsisting and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of declaration. The post-nuptial process is being repealed with effect from 30 November 2002. By way of a transitional provision, persons who are married to Irish citizens before that date but fail to satisfy the three-year criterion at that time can make the declaration after that date upon completion of three years of marriage.

          <p eId="para_3579">I propose to take Questions Nos. 654 and 657 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3580">I am aware that the phocine distemper virus – PDV – has in recent times caused the deaths of a large number of seals in European and UK waters. To date only one case of PDV – off the Aran Islands, County Galway – has been confirmed in seals found in Irish waters. A number of other dead seals have been forwarded to the veterinary college of University College, Dublin, for laboratory examination. To date none have been confirmed as having PDV. Two seals found in Northern Ireland waters have however been confirmed after laboratory examination as having PDV.</p>
          <p eId="para_3581">As regards the statement in the correspondence referred to from the Irish Seal Sanctuary about approximately 100 seals having washed up dead on the Irish coastline, it is a regular occurrence for seals, particularly pups, to be washed up at this time of year because of heavy seas resulting from stormy weather, and such individual deaths would not necessarily or normally be related to PDV.</p>
          <p eId="para_3582">My Department has put in place arrangements to monitor the incidence of PDV amongst the seal population in Irish waters through its network of conservation rangers, Dúchas regional management and Dúchas research branch. Local authorities have also been requested to maintain vigilance in relation to current events and to liaise with the above specialist personnel. My officials have been in ongoing contact with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK, and information on developments in our respective waters is being shared. Meetings have also been held with representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary and communication with them remains open.</p>
          <p eId="para_3583">Phocine distemper virus represents a natural phenomenon among seals. The reality is that the disease must necessarily take its course, as it is not possible to administer vaccine to wild seal populations and attempted rehabilitation of affected seals has not been shown to be effective. My Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_3587">Local authorities receive a total combined annual capital allocation from my Department in respect of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes and house purchase and improvement loans. Galway City Council received an allocation of €700,000 and Galway County Council received an allocation of €2,603,000 for 2002. The allocation of funds between the various schemes is a matter for individual authorities in the light of local circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_3588">Apart from these allocations, my Department's involvement with funding for the disabled persons grant and essential repairs grant schemes relates primarily to the recoupment of up to two-thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant scheme is funded at local authority level from the authorities' own resources and within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation from my Department in the event of increased demand under the schemes, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's own provision for expenditure under the schemes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_627">In recent years, the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities has increased significantly. Since 2 December 1998, the effective maximum grant available under the disabled persons scheme doubled from €10,158 to €20,320 and the rate of recoupment to local authorities increased from 50% of grants paid to two-thirds of grants paid and. In relation to the essential repairs grant, prior to 2 December 1998, local  authorities were recouped 50% of each essential repairs grant paid up to a maximum of €1,143 in each case. Since that date two-thirds of the amount of grant paid is recouped, up to a maximum recoupment of €8,467 in each case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_628">I am aware of the significant level of increased activity in relation to these schemes in the Galway City and Galway County Council areas. In line with the increase in the Department's provision for the disabled persons grant and essential repairs grants scheme, the recoupment to Galway City and Galway County Councils has also increased substantially. Last year the Department recouped to Galway City Council €445,905 in respect of 65 disabled persons grants and €14,417 in respect of three essential repairs grants compared to €127,591 in respect of 42 disabled persons grants in 1998. Galway City Council did not pay any essential repairs grants in 1998. Galway County Council was recouped €1,056,779 in respect of 155 disabled persons grants and €615,311 in respect of 156 essential repairs grants in 2001 compared with €223,573 in respect of 83 disabled persons grants and €21,713 in respect of 19 essential repairs grants in 1998.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_629">The special housing aid for the elderly scheme, administered by a task force under the aegis of my Department and operated by the health boards, was established to provide assistance to improve housing conditions of elderly people living alone in unfit or unsanitary conditions. Funding is made available on an annual basis to the health boards for the operation of the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_630">Galway County Council has contacted my Department regarding the raising of a loan to facilitate payment of its contribution of one-third of the cost in respect of disabled person and essential repair grants already paid or approved and not yet paid for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_3590">As part of the process towards transposition and implementation of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles (ELVS), my Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association (IMVRA), the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland – MRAI – and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions  of the directive. These stakeholder bodies submitted an agreed initial proposal for an ELV management scheme towards the end of last year. This replaced earlier proposals by SIMI alone. Consultants were engaged by the stakeholders to assist in the development of the agreed initial proposals. I am preparing appropriate legislative proposals to provide for implementation of the detailed ELV management scheme consistent with the requirements of the ELV directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_3591">Transposition of the directive will impose obligations on a range of persons, including for example vehicle importers and retailers, dismantlers and owners of ELVs. A breach of such obligations will constitute an offence under the transposing legislation. In this regard, the Waste Management Act, 1996, already provides for controls on ELVs. Section 71 of the Act specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to remove and deal appropriately with such vehicles. Section 32(1) of the Act prohibits the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies, <i>inter alia,</i> to the owner of an ELV. It is incumbent on the owner of an ELV to dispose of it in a responsible manner, by transferring it to one of a number of facilities that have – unless otherwise licensed – been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of such vehicles. The enforcement of these statutory provisions relating to the abandonment and recovery of ELVs is a matter for the local authorities. My Department recently requested local authorities to ensure that all vehicle dismantlers and shredders operating in their functional area hold the necessary waste permits or licences.</p>

          <p eId="para_3594">The Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, increase from 23 square metres to 40 square metres, subject to certain conditions, the size of extensions to the rear of houses which are exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, where the house has not been extended previously. The exemption is subject to compliance with a number of con ditions and limitations. The regulations specify different limits for different circumstances, e.g. whether or not the house had been previously extended and whether it is detached, semi-detached or terraced. In addition, the regulations contain a number of conditions designed to ensure that the changes in relation to exempted development extensions do not result in any injury to the amenities of adjoining properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_3595">One of these conditions is that the construction or erection of any such extension shall not reduce the area of private open space to the rear of the house to less than 25 square metres.</p>

The board may recommend boundary changes to me on foot of hearing the appeal. Amendment of boundaries may also arise where my Department staff identifies a need to amend a boundary on foot of additional survey work or other new information.

Given that Portumna Castle is in a semi-ruined state primarily because of severe fire damage in the past, our knowledge of the historic fabric of the castle is incomplete and is likely to remain so.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_3677">Kilkenny County Council were allocated a total of €4.1 million for their local authority housing programme in 2002 compared to expenditure of €7.04 million last year, when activity on the programme was at a higher level. The 2002 allocation consists of an Exchequer capital grant of €1.6 million combined with the use of internal capital receipts of €2.5 million. This allocation relates to the main local authority housing construction-acquisition programme, the provision of extensions to local authority houses, the undertaking of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and the provision of Traveller accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3678">The councils recently requested additional Exchequer funding this year due to an emerging shortfall in the amount of its internal capital receipts. This application is being considered by my Department. My Department has already conveyed approval to the council to purchase a turnkey development of eight houses in Goresbridge and it is expected that the council will be seeking my Department's approval to accept a tender for a six house scheme in Johnstown in the near future. It is understood from the council that further schemes will be submitted to the Department for approval to proceed in due course and it has also been indicated that 40 house completions are anticipated in the current year.</p>

          <p eId="para_3685">I propose to take Questions Nos. 690 and 691 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3686">The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has the ultimate objective of preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and places a particular responsibility on developed countries to adopt policies and measures aimed at mitigating climate change by limiting emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
          <p eId="para_3687">Article 4 of the convention outlines the detailed commitments of parties including requirements to adopt and implement national programmes to limit greenhouse gas emissions; to publish national communications outlining the policies and measures aimed at returning, individually or jointly, to 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by the end of that decade; to produce national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and removal by sinks; assist developing country parties through capacity building, technology transfer and financial transfers, including assisting those that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation; to co-operate in scientific research and to promote and co-operate in education, training and public awareness related to climate change and encourage the widest participation in this process, including that of non-governmental organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_3688">In recognition of the different economic conditions and other considerations in the member states, the EU agreed to joint fulfilment of the convention's emissions limitation objective and returned to below its 1990 emissions levels by 2000 – a 3.5% reduction was achieved.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_634">Ireland continues to meet its obligations under the convention through,inter alia, annual financial contributions to the trust funds under the convention and the global environment facility, the financial mechanism of the convention; publication of Ireland's climate change CO2 abatement strategy in June 1993 and the national climate change strategy in November 2000; submission of Ireland's first and second national communications in October 1994 and July 1997, respectively; production of annual greenhouse gas inventories compiled by the EPA in accordance with the guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – IPCC; inclusion of climate related research projects in the EPA's environ mental research programme under the Productive Sector Operational Programme 2000-2006 and ensuring availability of climate change information by ENFO and through the national environmental awareness campaign. In addition, my Department provides financial support for the NGO community to promote civil society participation in the meetings of the conference of the parties under the convention.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_635">The Kyoto Protocol to the convention, adopted in 1997, commits industrialised or developed countries to legally binding targets to reduce, individually or jointly, their combined emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases with a view to achieving an overall reduction of at least 5% compared to 1990 levels by the period 2008-12.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_636">Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol, as part of the joint fulfilment of an EU 8% reduction target, is to limit emissions of greenhouse gases to an increase of 13% above our 1990 baseline by 2008-12.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_637">The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, sets a ten year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_638">Ireland, together with all other member states and the EU, ratified the protocol on 31 May 2002. In parallel with ratification, the first progress report implementing the strategy was published. Measures already under way in the first year are capable of yielding reductions of up to 3.3 Mt CO2 equivalent of the 13.1 Mt CO2 equivalent reductions required below the business as usual projections in the national climate change strategy to meet our Kyoto obligations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_639">Implementation of the national climate change strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team, chaired by my Department. The team has recently initiated the first biennial review of the strategy, to be undertaken in consultation with Comhar and finalised by spring of 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_640">I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008-12 period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_641">Copies of Ireland's first and second national communications together with the 1993 CO2 abatement strategy, the 2000 national climate change strategy and the first progress report – 1993 – on this strategy are available in the Oireachtas Library.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3692">Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, which was published in 1997, reflects and takes forward in the Irish context the action programme for sustainable development – Agenda 21 – which was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The strategy aims at providing a comprehensive analysis and framework to allow sustainable development to be advanced in Ireland in a systematic manner. It includes an analysis of the relationship between economic activities and the environment and an agenda to reinforce and deepen integration of environmental concerns; a strategic framework of priorities;action in strategic sectors agriculture, forestry, marine resources, energy, industry, transport, tourism and trade; measures in supporting sectors environmental quality, settlement and land use planning, the built environment, public action and awareness, and Ireland's international role and arrangements for implementation and monitoring.</p>
          <p eId="para_3693">Since 1997, the strategy has had a significant influence on environment policy and on the environmental dimension of sectoral policies in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_3694">The recent policy report, Making Ireland's Development Sustainable, published by my Department, reviews and assesses sustainable development action in Ireland over the past decade and sets out policy priorities for the period ahead. As stated in the report, policy developments at the EU and wider international levels – including the EU sustainable development strategy adopted at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001 provide an important context and support for the advancement of national environmental and sustainable development policy. Copies of the report have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>

Accordingly, I cannot comment on any putative findings. Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste provides that the location of a landfill must take into consideration requirements relating, among other things, to the distances from the boundary of the proposed site to residential areas, and stipulates that a landfill can be authorised only if the characteristics of the site with respect to this and other specified requirements, or corrective measures to be taken, indicate that the landfill does not pose a serious environmental risk.</p>

The waste licensing system operated by the EPA is intended to ensure that high standards of environmental protection apply in relation to the operation of relevant waste facilities. The EPA may not grant a waste licence unless it is satisfied, among other things, that any emissions from the activity concerned will not contravene any relevant standard and that the activity concerned, carried on in accordance with licence conditions, will not cause environmental pollution. In the circumstances, I have no proposals at this time for amendment of regulations relating to the licensing of landfill facilities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3743">Local authorities receive a total combined annual capital allocation from my Department in respect of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes and house purchase and improvement loans. The allocation of funds between the various schemes is a matter for individual authorities in the light of local circumstances. My Department's funding of the disabled persons grant scheme relates to the recoupment of up to two thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant scheme is also funded at local authority level from the authorities' own resources and within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation from my Department in the event of increased demand under the scheme, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's own provision for expenditure under the scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_647">In recent years, the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities has increased significantly. Since 2 December 1998, the effective maximum grant available under the scheme doubled from €10,158 to €20,320 and the rate of recoupment to local authorities increased from 50% of grants paid to two thirds of grants paid. In line with this increase in the Department's provision for the disabled persons grant  scheme, the recoupment to Waterford City and Waterford County Councils has also increased substantially. Last year the Department recouped to Waterford City Council €270,236 in respect of 39 disabled persons grants compared to €51,155 in respect of 16 grants in 1998. Waterford County Council was recouped €287,215 in respect of 60 disabled persons grants in 2001 compared with €99,892 in respect of 49 grants in 1998.</summary>

The forum was first convened in May 2000 and has met on two occasions since then. Issues discussed at previous meetings of the forum included progress on the implementation of the White Paper on Rural Development, the National Spatial Strategy, rural transport, rural tourism, rural planning and financial services in rural areas.

Since its commencement in 1996, a total of €32.5 million has been allocated to this scheme which, to the end of 2001, has assisted some 89,136 individuals.

To be eligible for grant aid under the scheme, individuals must be aged 65 and over and living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves. In general, grants under the scheme cover 50% of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the  necessary security equipment but grants of up to 90% may be made where the circumstances so warrant.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_649">Any voluntary or community based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may apply for grant aid.

        <summary eId="sum_653">An Foras Teanga is one of the cross-Border implementation bodies, which was established on 2 December 1999 when the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, came into effect. It is comprised of two separate agencies – Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulster Scotch. Foras na Gaeilge is charged with increasing the use of Irish in everyday life throughout the island of Ireland, while the responsibility of Tha Boord o Ulster Scotch is the promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island. The evaluation of the corporate development plans of both of these agencies for the period 2002-04 is nearing completion. Progress on the performance indicators identified in these plans will be incorporated in the annual report and accounts of the body, which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</summary>

      <b>Mr. McHugh</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to a study carried out in 2001 which determined that the towns of Tuam and Ballinasloe in County Galway were found to be among the ten most disadvantaged towns in the country; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that it was determined at the time that this disadvantage would be addressed through the RAPID programme; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that to date no development has taken place; if the disadvantage in both towns will be allowed to continue; the measures he intends to take to ensure the RAPID programme will be used to deliver improvements to the two towns; the elements which will be included in the RAPID programme for both towns; when the programme will be commenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

An area implementation team comprising representatives of the relevant State agencies and residents from the local community was established in each town to prepare a plan for the area. The plans for Tuam and Ballinasloe were prepared and sent to the national co-ordinator in Area Development Management Limited in October last. I understand the proposals contained in these plans have been forwarded to the relevant Departments for consideration in the past few days.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_3799">Mayfield community adult learning project, (CALP), has been indirectly supported through my Department's community development programme since early 2000. Through an enhanced funding scheme made available to participating projects in this programme, Mayfield community development project received funding additional to their core budget to support the CALP project. The enhanced funding scheme was designed to offer limited funding to projects to undertake additional work, which could not otherwise be carried out within available core staffing resources. Under this enhanced funding scheme, Mayfield CDP received £47,337, €60,105, over a two year period to employ a co-ordinator for the CALP project. This funding was provided on a strictly time limited basis with an expiry date of April 2002, in the case of funding in respect of the CALP project.</p>
          <p eId="para_3800">Mayfield CDP received a further special once-off payment of €25,000 earlier this year to assist in sustaining the project until end 2002 and to allow the project additional time to source alternative funding. I understand that the CALP project has now secured a funding commitment from the Department of Education and Science in the sum of €45,000 to fund the co-ordinator position for 2003. CALP is now seeking funding from my Department to employ an administrator. The question of further support to the CALP project through the community development support programmes is being considered in light of the overall resource availability and competing demands within the programmes. The availability of funding from other sources will also be a factor in the decision making process.</p>

Following a review in April 2002 the target staffing levels for the two office are 37.5 in Dundalk and 24 in Drogheda. There are also currently 12 investigative posts in Drogheda and nine such posts in Dundalk and this is considered appropriate. The staffing requirements of the Department's accounts branch were determined in advance of decentralisation to Dundalk.

The average rise nationally in the same period is approximately 15%. The general economic slowdown and particularly its effect on the tourism sector would appear to be impacting on both of those counties. My Department, through its employment support services and in conjunction with other agencies, will continue to assist those persons on the live register make the transition to work, education and relevant training.

An application form for the bereavement grant has been issued to the person concerned and will be processed as soon as it is received. The widowed parent's grant is payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow(er)'s contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant. As the person concerned is not a widow, she is not entitled to this payment. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his/her weekly income.</p>

A review of entitlement to farm assist is carried out based on the response. If a completed declaration form is not returned, payment is automatically suspended. The person concerned was in receipt of farm assist from 11 September 2000. A farm assist declaration form was issued to him in June 2002. His weekly rate of payment at that time was €248.00. When no reply was received, his payment was stopped with effect from 23 July 2002. The person concerned first contacted his social welfare local office regarding the suspension of his payment on 23 October 2002. His weekly farm assist was reinstated from that date. His entitlements in the intervening period are currently being examined.</p>

          <p eId="para_3894">In order to qualify for the various household benefits, a person must be living alone or only with certain excepted categories of people. These categories include spouses in respect of whom applicants are receiving a qualified adult allowance. A qualified adult allowance can remain in payment at proportionately reduced rates where the spouse concerned is earning up to €196.81 per week. Spouses who are in receipt of unemployment benefit in their own  right are not excepted for household benefit purposes. In the case of the couple concerned, the husband qualified for electricity allowance and free television licence in June 2001. At that time, he was in receipt of retirement pension and a reduced rate qualified adult allowance in respect of his wife, who was in employment. Under the household benefits rules, his entitlement to these ceased when his wife qualified for unemployment benefit in her own right in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_3895">The apparent anomaly highlighted by the Deputy in this case arises from the fact that the qualified adult allowance may be payable in conjunction with earnings from employment and the loss of employment results in a reduction in household income. The income to the couple from the social welfare system has, however, increased. Arising from the Deputy's concern I will consider the matter in the context of the budget and its cost implications. An expansion of household benefits conditions to cover the circumstances such as that of the couple concerned would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of other priorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_3897">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. In order to be eligible an applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment, must satisfy a means test and must live alone or only with specified persons. People who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pension, unemployment assistance or one parent family payment automatically qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment. In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to €50.79 per week or savings/investments of up to €41,901.35 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_664">In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension, a person must,inter alia, have a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance  record. Reduced pensions are however, paid for yearly averages below 48 and down to ten. In 1997 the minimum average number of contributions for which person could be paid was reduced from 20 to ten. A person with a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited from 1979 to age 66 can qualify for a full pension, regardless of previous contributions. Otherwise, average contributions are assessed over a person's working life, i.e. from the first time a person enters social insurance until he or she reaches retirement age.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_665">In 2000, the Department published a review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, phase one. This report proposed, among other things, that consideration be given to changing the basis of assessment for old age (contributory) and retirement pensions from the current system of average contributions to one based on total contributions paid or credited. The report considered that this would be a more straightforward and fairer way of assessing entitlement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_666">The phase two report is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to publish it as a discussion document in the near future. The report will assess the implications of a system of assessment based on total contributions and outline options for such a system, taking account of the potential people have for accumulating contributions and the developments in the social insurance system over the last 30 years which have resulted in considerably extended coverage of the workforce by the social insurance system.</summary>

In addition, the Department has also published a customer action plan and an internal customer service plan, both of which set out specific targets in relation to the provision of service to customers of the Department (both external and internal) over the three year period, 2001-4.

The plan also contains a range of goals and actions based on the strategic objectives. In delivering these objectives, the performance of the CPA will be measured through a set of key performance indicators in addition to more detailed indicators contained in lower level annual work plans. There will also be an overall evaluation of the agency's performance under the plan. The following are significant indicators which relate to the strategic objectives of CPA's plan: provide a baseline measure of the extent of poverty among groups not included in national surveys and identify indi cators which will measure improvements in their living conditions; produce research publications on the emerging causes of poverty; publish and promote research on the costs of child rearing; commission, publish and promote the key lessons from an evaluation of the local government anti-poverty learning network; produce a series of analyses to support the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy; publish and promote a study on social expenditure; enhance social inclusion indicators included in the regional and peace II programmes; publish and promote research and resource materials on the role of community development in tackling poverty; and publish and promote a research study on combating food poverty.</summary>

However, the agency publishes an annual report which sets out its work under each objective. In addition, the impact of each plan was independently evaluated and the findings informed the development of each subsequent plan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_672">Comhairle was established in June 2000 and had its first strategy plan approved by my predecessor in July 2001. The strategy identifies a number of strategic priority objectives as listed below. Each of these objectives identifies two to three key performance indicators: information content – to ensure that information produced by Comhairle is of a high quality, timely, accurate and relevant; delivery of information, advice and advocacy – to ensure that information and advice services offered are of a high quality, accurate, comprehensive, understandable and customer focused to assist people with particular needs to secure their entitlements to social services; social policy – to identify and bring to the attention of the relevant authorities the feedback of citizens and information providers in relation to the operation of social services; voluntary sector – to assist and promote the development of the voluntary sector in relation to social and civil services; promoting equality of access – to promote equality of access in relation to civil and social services. A strategy implementation plan was completed in January 2002 and provides a detailed strategy implementation framework and details key activities, tasks and timeframes. Implementation plan performance is formally reviewed on a half-yearly basis by Comhairle's management team.</summary>

The main priorities in the plan are implementation of the national pensions policy initiative (NPPI), effective regulation, policy development, pensions coverage development and maximising role and resources. The plan also contains a range of actions to lead to the achievement of the strategic objectives. In delivering the objectives, the performance of the board will be measured through a set of key performance indi cators, of which a total of 85 have been identified to date, in addition to more detailed indicators contained in lower level annual work plans. The board also publishes an annual report which sets out its work under each objective of the plan.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3998">A widow/er aged 60 to 65 can retain household benefits if their late spouse was in receipt of them and provided that the couple were permanently residing together at the time of the death. The late husband of the person concerned had been entitled to free travel as he was aged over 66 and on that basis the person concerned was issued with a free travel pass in her own right after his death. He was not, however, in receipt of the other free schemes at the time of his death nor did he have an entitlement to them as he was not in receipt of a qualifying pension. In these circumstances, the person concerned does not have an entitlement to household benefits until she is 66 years of age. The person concerned is in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension and was awarded an electricity allowance in error from 1 October 2001. When the error was discovered, the allowance ceased with effect from July 2002. Her application for a telephone allowance was refused on the grounds that she was under 66 years of age.</p>

          <p eId="para_4000">The person's claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for  employment. The person concerned is employed part-time and her contract of employment stated that she was not permitted to be engaged in, or connected with, any other employment. The person subsequently produced evidence from her employer that this clause had been inserted in error. However, the deciding officer did not consider that this additional evidence warranted a change in the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_4001">The person concerned appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office. An appeals officer, having considered all the evidence presented, including that adduced at an oral hearing, disallowed the appeal. The appeals officer's decision was based on the fact that, although the new contract stated that the person concerned was available to pursue full-time employment, the person's efforts in that regard do not suggest that she is available for employment in the substantial manner required under social welfare legislation. Notification of the decision has issued to the person concerned. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</p>

      the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kildare has been refused the third level option allowance, in view of the fact that only a simple technicality precludes them from qualification and that other students who have pursued the same courses but have not accepted a degree still continue to qualify; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_4003">As part of its employment support services, my Department provides a wide range of second chance educational opportunities for unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities. The basic intention of the scheme is to direct assistance towards those who are most at risk from long-term unemployment by affording them the opportunity to acquire an educational qualification which will enhance their employment prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_4004">The person concerned applied for participation in the back to work education allowance scheme in order to pursue a four to five year Ph.D. in medieval Irish history and sources at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. She was a participant in the back to work education allowance scheme from September 1997 to June 2002 during which time she obtained a bachelor of arts degree and a postgraduate master of arts degree in medieval Irish studies.</p>
