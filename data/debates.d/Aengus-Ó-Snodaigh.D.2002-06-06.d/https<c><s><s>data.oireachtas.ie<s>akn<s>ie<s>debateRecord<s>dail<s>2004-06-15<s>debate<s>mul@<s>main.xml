          </question>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_8">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">My Department has responsibility for overall co-ordination and promotion of the modernisation programme for the Civil Service through the implementation group of Secretaries General which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. A number of sub-groups oversee progress in the different strands of the modernisation programme and these initiatives are taken forward in close collaboration between my Department and the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I am pleased to note that significant progress continues to be recorded with the modernisation programme and, in particular, with the commitments to modernisation included in Sustaining Progress. A progress report on implementation of the these commitments across the Civil Service was submitted to the Civil Service performance verification group prior to the pay increases granted last January and this report has been published on the Department of Finance website. A further progress report will be considered by the PVG in advance of the payment due on 1 July next and it is also intended to publish this. These reports record progress across a wide range of areas including, for example, more use of competitive promotions and greater open recruitment of staff, development of new financial information systems and a recent evaluation of the performance management and development system in the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">The quality customer service initiative is another aspect of the modernisation programme and good progress in this area continues to be made under the guidance of the working group chaired by Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. The most significant recent development has been the customer charter initiative. Following the publication of guidelines by the working group, many Departments and offices have already published their charters, with the remainder scheduled to do so within the coming months. Departments and offices were required to consult their customers and establish service standards in their charter based on customer needs. They will also be required to report on performance against these standards in their annual report. The working group organised training and other supports to assist Departments and offices during the preparation of their charters and will continue to monitor progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Other projects overseen by the working group in the recent past include publication of a report on internal customer service in January 2004 and identifying projects from across the public service that demonstrate innovative approaches to improving the quality of service and administration. These will be show-cased at events in Dublin, Limerick and Cork during July.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">With regard to better regulation, which is also specifically raised by a number of Deputies, considerable progress has been achieved since the publication of the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. Many of the recommendations related to specific sectoral issues and progress in this regard was recorded in a report published by the high level group on regulation in January 2003. A central element of the Government's response to the OECD report was the formulation of a White Paper on better regulation. As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the White Paper in January 2004 and copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The White Paper sets out six core principles of better regulation and a detailed action plan to translate these principles into how we design, implement and review legislation and regulations. Key actions include introduction of regulatory impact analysis, RIA, initially on a pilot basis; new systematic reviews of existing regulations in key areas; improvements to our approach to sectoral regulation; a renewed drive to tackle red tape; and greater clarity and accessibility of regulation. A new better regulation group is being established to oversee implementation of the actions outlined in the White Paper, and I hope it will meet within the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Another important action arising from the White Paper is a programme of Statute Law revision to identify legislation in need of repeal, revision or consolidation. This will ensure the Statute Book is up to date and more accessible. A key element of this programme is a project to update pre-1922 legislation and, as the first phase, a consultation process is under way on the list of legislation proposed for repeal. As already stated, another key action in the White Paper is the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis as recommended by the OECD. A working group of officials has developed an approach to RIA which would be suitable for the Irish legislative and policy making context. It is intended to pilot this shortly in a number of Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">Overall, good progress has been achieved in implementing the change and modernisation agenda in the Civil Service. As I have already stated, this is extensively documented through the performance verification process established under the Sustaining Progress agreement. As well as verifying progress in the Civil Service as a whole, each Department and office submits progress reports and these demonstrate that considerable advances continue to be achieved at local level, leading to continued improvements in the quality and efficiency of services provided to the public.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_17">I see an unusually large attendance of backbenchers to listen to the Taoiseach today. Obviously the word is out.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_3">

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_19">I suppose it is back to reality with a bang. Has the Taoiseach taken note of the Tánaiste's post-election comments about the necessity to speed up the process of deregulation? After seven years, it appears as if some Departments are quite lax in this regard. Does he agree with her comments?</p>
            <p eId="para_20">In respect of OECD regulatory reform, an issue raised on numerous occasions, will the Taoiseach outline what progress, if any, has been made on removing the barrier of entry into the Irish market facing foreign educated pharmacists? This is causing a deal of controversy.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">Will the Taoiseach comment on a recent report from IBEC which found that in 2004, three years after the publication of the OECD report, red tape is costing Irish business €600 million per year? This backs up earlier claims by ISME, which stated in its report that the Government is seen as a barrier to progress rather than a facilitator of enterprise. Will the Taoiseach comment on these reports?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_22">With regard to the first issue and the Tánaiste's remarks, the OECD report is being implemented and I have given a detailed reply on where this is being done. Deregulation and regulation are not always the same issue. Regulation results in additional costs for business but, in many cases, it is necessary. The OECD, working group and cross-departmental group have all pointed in recent years to the areas in which there should be change and others where perhaps regulation is strengthened.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">IBEC and ISME tend to take the view that regulation is unnecessary. They find everything a burden, but it is necessary to have regulation. For example, people are calling for more health and safety regulation and compliance. We are not in a position where we are trying to get rid of all regulation. The Cabinet has just finalised a health and safety Bill, which will introduce more regulation, but it is necessary to do that, while we are trying to eliminate these issues in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">With regard to pharmacies, the pharmacy review group was set up following the OECD report on regulatory reform. It was asked to review the 1996 pharmacy regulations and, among other matters, the pharmacy issues raised in the report. The group's principal task was to assess the existing statutory restrictions on entry to the community pharmacy sector that placed restrictions on access to pharmacy contracts under the 1996 regulations. The group submitted its report early last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">The Minister for Health and Children has examined the legal and other issues surrounding the group's recommendations and the report will be published shortly. He has stated he intends to consolidate and update existing pharmacy legislation. Broadly, the proposed Bill will provide for the safe and effective delivery of pharmaceutical services to all citizens through a comprehensive, manageable and robust legislative framework. It will address, in particular, the education, training, registration and control of pharmacists and it will incorporate the recommendations of the pharmacy review group.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_26">The Taoiseach did not comment on IBEC's statement that red tape is costing businesses €600 million per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has received the steering group's report to Government on the review of the Garda's structures and organisation. Has the Cabinet discussed it? Does the Taoiseach accept a recommendation in the report that the closure of some Garda stations in Dublin and throughout the country should proceed? In light of that and the Government's failure to deliver on its promise of 2,000 extra gardaí, will there be a reduction in the number of gardaí following the implementation of the report?</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_31">Perhaps it might not always be from this quarter that verbal fire is directed at the Chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">Will the SMI report on the structure and organisation of the Garda be published and the information and recommendations contained in it made available to the public?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_33">I thought I answered the question on IBEC. Business interests tend to take the view that regulation with which they must comply is a burden on them. The ISME and IBEC reports pointed out that for every eight people employed by small businesses, half of one person's time is taken up by this. That is how they use the cost base. They are included in all regulations. Where we can get rid of red tape and regulations we should do so, but there are other areas which should be regulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Those organisations cannot take a simple analysis. I have no disagreement with their stated position on getting rid of unnecessary red tape, but not in a broad sweep. It would be wrong to get rid of all requirements in terms of statutory reports from the CSO or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That would be wrong and I do not agree with the broad-brush statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">The issue of the gardaí does not come under the Civil Service process. The Government has stated that the 2003 levels would be maintained, that recruitment and training would stay at those levels, and that when finances returned to the position at which we put a ceiling on that level we would return to that issue. We said those levels would not decrease in the meantime and that was the position. The Deputy should take the reports issue up with the Minister but it does not come under regulatory reform.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_36">Was the Taoiseach's attention drawn to a recent speech by the chairman of Independent News Media, Dr. Tony O'Reilly, about over-regulation and excessive red tape being a cost on business, possibly to the extent that it is detrimental to employment? Does the Taoiseach agree with those views?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_13">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_37">As I said, the idea of the OECD report was that Ireland would take a lead on this issue. At that stage only one other country had prepared a paper on better regulation so we were in front in looking at how better regulation can make the process more cost-effective and simpler. It does not mean that we remove all regulation, and business interests continually make that point. We are trying to operate better regulations and, as I said, there is a new group to take forward the next phase of the White Paper. We set out our views in the White Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The questions raised by the chairman of Independent News and Media and others are exactly the questions highlighted in the White Paper. I am glad the White Paper is generating interest in so many areas, not just among business groups. The questions raised are, is regulation necessary, is regulation properly targeted and framed appropriately, have we consulted stakeholders, is there an effective appeals process and will the regulations give rise to conflicts and anomalies. Those are the questions posed, and the chairman of Independent News and Media and others have said that we should try to simplify the mechanisms which are in place and, in so far as possible, we should only use regulation where it is absolutely proven to stand up to the questions I mentioned. That is a fair approach by those interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">Deputy Kenny asked about costs. It has been stated that any cost involved in regulation is a cost too much, but I do not agree with that view. It is necessary to have regulation in some areas and that business comply with regulation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_40">The Tánaiste mentioned the need to take hard decisions and she referred specifically to different aspects of the OECD recommendations. Does the Taoiseach agree with her that the Government ought to proceed to take those hard decisions or does he take a different view?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_15">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_41">The Government makes hard and easy decisions. It makes whatever decisions are necessary. The Government has been, and will be, engaged in reforms in many areas. We have ongoing discussions on transport, health, reform of the issues mentioned, including the OECD reform which affects the Civil Service. These are issues in which the Government is, and will continue to be, actively engaged and which were outlined in Sustaining Progress. These are areas in which we will continue to make decisions, as necessary.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_16">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_42">In the Government's White Paper on better regulation there is a list of actions relating to the legislative process and one calls for better information on new legislation. It promises that Departments and offices will provide such improved information, including the draft heads of new and promised legislation. I have asked the Taoiseach this question before and I am revisiting it despite the assurance that this would happen. On how many Bills did we receive advance notice of heads of the Bill following agreement? Unless the Taoiseach's information runs contrary to mine, why has this commitment not been proceeded with and implemented?</p>
            <p eId="para_43">I will not go back over past legislation but will take a Bill which will be taken in the future, and perhaps the Taoiseach will give us a commitment rather than revisit the reason this commitment has not been acted on heretofore. In regard to the proposed health Bill which will deal with the implementation of the Hanly report, will the Taoiseach give us a commitment on whether and how soon we will see the published heads of that Bill, in line with the recommendations and commitment detailed in the Government's White Paper on regulatory reform?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_17">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_44">In the case of some legislation, it is necessary to circulate the heads of the Bill for discussion, but on amending or consolidating legislation, there is not the same requirement. What is recommended in the OECD report and by the various groups I mentioned in the reply is that when legislation is being prepared the State and Departments should see whether legislation is absolutely necessary and if it is the only way to go, that we should not legislate if it is unnecessary and is just another burden. If, however, legislation is necessary, we should have discussion with the stakeholders, the organisations, and that happens on a regular basis. When legislation is announced, those affected will make their observations known, look for meetings and engage in the lobbying process. That happens as a matter of form. The report states that it should perhaps happen at an earlier stage and that it should not be left until the legislation is almost drafted. Departments are now advised to do that, particularly in regard to new legislation and new concepts. The high level group will monitor that to make sure it is done. In some cases, heads of Bills are brought before committees of this House for debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">In regard to health, all the health reports and reports on reform set out what should happen in the future. The new health Bill will be based on what is in those reports. That information is in the public domain. The Minister will draft the legislation based on the suggestions in those four or five reports and he is working on that at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">The Taoiseach gave us a partial answer in some ways. I wish to ask about the other side of the OECD report on regulatory reform which cited a criticism of the Government in not allowing consumer interests to be properly represented in policy debate and deliberation. Will the Taoiseach inform the House whether the Government is reflecting on that criticism and if it will act on it by providing for representation of consumer groups or the Consumers' Association of Ireland in the social partnership process?</p>
            <p eId="para_47">In regard to regulatory reform being a key part of the Lisbon Agenda, will the Taoiseach inform the House whether he is taking on board the views of the Institute of European Affairs which praised the Government on one hand, but, on the other, cited this country as one of those least willing to improve in terms of sustainable development and social protection? Will he assure Members that the reforms to Ireland's regulatory regime will not produce further deterioration in the areas of sustainable development and social protection? Is that an assurance he gave in terms of a "Yes" or "No" answer?</p>

            <p eId="para_48">The answer to the Deputy's second question is "Yes". It is necessary to try to ensure, as I said as the outset, that when we need to make changes, it is done by way of regulation, not deregulation. We are trying to simplify matters and, where protections are needed, it is important to ensure that social protections are included. In the area of environmental matters, sustainable development is the key issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Regarding the Deputy's first question, he raised that issue with me last year when I answered a similar question on customer quality groups and consumer interest. I said at that time that we would consider that proposal. We have now included groups from the Consumers' Association of Ireland and the Small Firms Association, and representatives of the Disability Federation, the National Disability Authority and the National and Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. The Consumers' Association of Ireland is also represented on the main departmental group. Therefore, representation of the consumer group is included in the membership of key central group driving this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">On the question of introducing better regulation as against deregulation, that is not the issue. As I explained at the outset, there are some areas we can regulate and it makes sense, is efficient and cost-effective to do so. Such regulation is good for business, the citizen, the consumer and is much more cost-effective from the point of view of driving forward productive areas. That argument has been well-made. The answer to the Deputy's question is "No" because better regulation involves improving the processes of policy formulation, legislative drafting and enhancing the overall effectiveness and coherence of regulation. It is not about loosely-defined privatisation or deregulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">Better regulation does not necessarily mean deregulation. In some cases consumers, investors and the broader public interest might best be served by introducing new regulation. I have made that point clear in answer to a number of questions. Other cases, however, may be served best by removing regulation. Deregulation means the partial or complete elimination of regulation in a sector to improve economic performance. As such, it can be regarded as a sub-set of better regulations and one option that can be taken in practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">It is widely recognised that better regulation demands a more sophisticated approach and the OECD report, which is the subject matter of these questions, noted that a deregulation programme by itself is usually too limited and is often neither possible nor desirable. The focus has shifted in many countries, including those of the European Union, from deregulation to smarter, simpler and better regulation. That is the issue; it is not a question of privatisation. In its short-term agenda, the Government has no particular proposals on privatisation, even though many workers in certain sectors would like to have ESOPs. We have said that we will take these issues on a case by case basis when it is strategically correct to do so.</p>

Will the draft heads of the proposed Health Bill, that will implement the Hanly report and the establishment of the health services executive, be published and circulated to Members and, if so, when?</p>

That is not a new process but the report says we should do it more often. It is up to each Department to do so and that is what has been recommended. Departments are being monitored in that respect so we will see it occurring more often.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">As regards regulatory reform, will the Taoiseach change the fact that our GDP and national social protection is the lowest in the EU, in percentage terms? Will the Taoiseach re-examine what he said at the conclusion of the EU Spring Council when he promised a cost-benefit analysis of climate change issues, so that no harm would be done to competitiveness? Will that matter make it difficult to integrate the Taoiseach's belief that there should not be further deterioration and his ability to deliver on it, given the commitments he has already made and the low percentage of GDP that is being spent on social protection?</p>

            <p eId="para_71">The Deputy's question was a more general question on social protection. An enormous amount of money is spent on social protection, which covers all areas and is not within the ambit of an individual Department. A cost factor arises in any legislation that contains social protection for citizens, which is not just the figure provided in economic statistics. That would not be the entire figure because, when one takes into account our social welfare system and the schemes run by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Transport, there is social protection in legislation across a range of areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">The figure it uses would not include all areas. I am not as familiar with this issue as when I was Minister for Labour, but then the Commission just used a narrow figure which was easily taken and was unconnected with anything else — it would not have included all social protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">The Lisbon strategy includes the economic, social and environmental strands which have been running since the Stockholm meeting in 1999. Sustainable development and environmental protections have to applied in an holistic way as part of any reforms or changes — they cannot be left out of the equation. When we talk about the drive for competition, more efficiencies and less or more regulations, it cannot be at the expense of sustainable development. That is why Goran Persson, the then Prime Minister, added the environmental aspects to the original Portuguese strategy of economic and social reform. Since then, sustainable development has had to part of all the examinations and studies. That is strictly watched and controlled by both the European Commission and the Lisbon strategy groups in the European Parliament and it is done so fairly well. Therefore, it is not competition in isolation, but rather competition as part of honouring economic, social and environmental issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments.

            <p eId="para_83">The communications unit works an 18-hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensure they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. The communications unit is estimated to save Departments in excess of €200,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">The Government Information Service, in conjunction with the Government Press Office, provides an information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media on behalf of myself, my Department and the Government.

            <p eId="para_85">The Government Information Service issues ministerial public engagements, both national and international, to the media on a weekly basis. It works with the NDP and community support framework information office to heighten public awareness and understanding of the national development plan.

Together with the Government Press Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs, the GIS organises and manages the media aspects of State visits and major State occasions.

Was the work of the unit suspended in any way to deal with that issue given that most of the coverage was political? Was any member of staff at either unit involved in making a complaint to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland with regard to coverage on the "Morning Ireland" programme of Thursday, 10 June, in regard to the Ringsend waste treatment plant involving Deputy Gormley of the Green Party?

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_63">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_110">Subject to certain conditions, a person whose means are insufficient to meet his or her basic needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant may be entitled to assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case and it was never intended to be an ongoing source of funding for crèches. The appropriate necessary services need to be funded directly in a sustainable and appropriate manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">This approach has been successfully adopted in certain health boards. The boards in question, with other agencies, have put in place appropriate long-term sustainable arrangements to meet the needs of the families concerned without requiring them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance. I want to see that approach taken up in the other health board regions so that we have sustainable child care arrangements in place throughout the State. The crèche supplement was introduced with the intention of providing assistance to a parent in need of short-term emergency support. This could arise, for example, where a parent would not be able to avail of necessary supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes without assistance with child minding. It was never intended that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme would provide ongoing support for crèches.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">When the change was announced in November 2003, 1,738 crèche supplements were being paid. This figure represented an increase of almost 150% in less than three years from January 2001 because payments were increasingly being made for reasons which were clearly outside the scope of the original intentions of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">The fact that supplements were in place for long duration in many cases indicates that they had become a long-term child care support rather than the short-term social welfare intervention which was originally intended. In effect, long-term child care needs were being provided through a short-term emergency provision scheme. This is not an appropriate way to meet the needs of the people in question. Consequently, the changes introduced are necessary to refocus that scheme on its original objective of providing short-term income support.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">I have held discussions with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and health board representatives to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to the provision of crèche and pre-school supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">As an interim measure crèche supplements in payment prior to 1 January 2004 are being allowed to continue. Health boards retain discretion to provide assistance by way of once-off exceptional needs payments in any case where a board considers that the circumstances of the case so warrant.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">As the Minster states, this scheme affects more than 1,700 disadvantaged children and their families. She has been lecturing us on her efforts to tackle the problem of social exclusion, yet to save €2.3 million she discontinued the crèche supplement, which gives disadvantaged mothers the opportunity to return and complete their education or be retrained for work to get themselves out of the social welfare net.

            <from>Mr. Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_118">Is it fair that children in disadvantaged areas are being affected by this? What provisions will be put in place to allow parents with children to return to education in September to finish the course or retrain for work? Will an appeals mechanism be put in place?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_67" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_119">As the Deputy knows, the crèche supplement is an emergency short-term measure. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform measures for staffing and capital grants support women who wish to return to work. They have a prerequisite of at least 10% towards the payment of the child care or crèche facility. In the Eastern Health Board area crèches are supported 90% by the health board, with a 10% supplement from my Department. This would not happen either in the Deputy's part of the world or in mine.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">If there is a policy decision that we should have State-run crèches under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children, it is the responsibility of that Department, likewise if it is under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform it should fall to that Department and not be a short-term measure coming from my Department. On that basis I brought in several representatives and officials to discuss the issue. As I indicated in my response, until we finalise this matter I will continue the payment of the crèche supplements to those in receipt thereof since 1 January 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">I have provided significant support for people returning to work, particularly those who are long-term unemployed and there are other facilities where those provisions are made through other schemes. That said, the basic premise is that a policy decision must be made as to whether it is necessary to provide 100% State aid towards crèches in particular circumstances and areas. It could be asked whether that should be the situation in our part of the world. There is an inequity in the way in which the matter is handled. This funding was initially provided to support women, particularly those suffering from alcohol or drug abuse or domestic problems, in obtaining counselling services. That support will continue under the exceptional needs payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">However, in pursuing this matter further it is quite obvious that we are dealing with an educational social disadvantage issue as opposed to someone who wishes to return to work or to participate in a counselling service. A fundamental review and analysis of the necessity for child care provision in certain circumstances, 100% funded by the State, must be conducted on that basis. I continue to do that and hope to meet with the relevant Ministers to pursue the matter further and finalise it.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">All sides of the House agree that to have an <i>ad hoc</i> measure like this does not benefit the parents, the children or the full administration of what we want to see in these crèches. Other health board areas have been able to address this issue fundamentally whereas in the large urban areas, particularly Dublin, they have not been in a position to do so. I am pursuing this measure on that basis and on the basis that we have a new policy direction on child care provision.</p>

      asked the

     if her attention has been drawn to the CORI justice commission’s annual socio-economic review (details supplied); if she will work to ensure the Government reverses its low-tax economic strategy and invests more in social provision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
     [17895/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_68" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_125">I have noted with interest the recently published CORI socio-economic review 2003, which focuses on reducing poverty and achieving social inclusion. These are key objectives of my Department which we are pursuing through the implementation of the revised national anti-poverty strategy. The CORI review quotes EUROSTAT figures which compare Ireland's social protection expenditure in 2000 as a proportion of GDP with the rest of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">There are several important factors which must be taken into account when considering this issue. Ireland's elderly population is a third lower than the EU average requiring much lower expenditure on pensions, health care and care of the elderly and Ireland does not provide for supplementary pensions under the State social welfare system leaving these to be provided through occupational schemes, and by private insurance, the subject of the current PRSA campaign. Expenditure on these schemes is, therefore, not included as social protection expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">The cost of the tax relief is not available to encourage people to make more pension provision; our level of unemployment is among the lowest in the EU thus requiring less expenditure on unemployment-related support. Furthermore, while Ireland has had low levels of investment in social and economic infrastructure historically, we are now financing a major catch up in infrastructure with public investment running to over 6% of GDP in 2002 compared to around 3.5% for the other cohesion countries, Spain and Portugal and 1% to 1.5 % for developed countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The wider economic policies successfully pursued by this Government in recent years have resulted in very significant increases in employment levels; reductions in unemployment, particularly in long-term unemployment; heavy investment in infrastructure and public services; and substantial increases in real terms in household incomes at all income levels. The success of these policies is reflected most clearly in the sharp decrease we have seen in consistent poverty over recent years. Consistent poverty has fallen from 15.1% in 1994 to some 5.2% in 2001. The Government is committed to reducing consistent poverty to below 2%, and ideally eliminating it, by 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">The Government's determination to continue to seek to improve the position of the most vulnerable in our society is reflected in the revised national anti-poverty strategy and in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion for 2003-2005. These contain ambitious targets across several areas, including that of raising the lowest social welfare rate to €150 per week in 2002 terms by 2007. The implementation of these targets will ensure that we are brought further along the road to our overall goal of building a more inclusive society in which everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_69">
            <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_131">The way to tackle social exclusion and poverty is not by emasculating the various schemes the Minister and her Department undertook earlier in the year, such as the rent allowance scheme to which Deputy Ring referred, the community employment schemes and the crèche allowance. Fuel allowance has not increased for ages. Is the Minister aware of the report compiled by UCD with the Combat Poverty Agency which showed that one in ten Irish households suffer from fuel poverty? Help should be given for this appalling inability to provide heating in so many homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The Minister must also be aware that 25% of households depend on €140 or less per week. The UN development programme report in 2003 clearly showed that Ireland continued to have the highest level of poverty outside the US. Would the Minister agree this is a shocking verdict on the iniquitous policies of a Government which the electorate in the most recent opinion poll clearly regards as right wing and socially divisive?</p>
            <p eId="para_133">Is the Minister aware that the wealthy have benefited disproportionately under the economic and social policies of this Government? Over seven budgets the Minister of Finance has allocated almost six times more resources to the top 30% of our society rather than to the lowest30%. Is that in the Minister's opinion a way to tackle radically the crisis of low Irish social spending clearly illustrated in the CORI report and backed up by the EUROSTAT report? How does the Minister propose to achieve our noble objectives of equity, fairness and social justice for all our people by pursuing such right-wing social and economic policies geared towards high earners? We have seen made to order tax breaks which benefit the very wealthy being added to Finance Bills at the last moment. Is that the way to carry on to ensure social inclusion?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_70" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_134">I do not agree with the Deputy because we have quite ambitious targets which we wish to pursue over the lifetime of this Government, on which we have made several strides in the last budget, particularly in the €10 increase across the board with additional increases to other specific categories. On that basis it is our intention to reach the NAPS target of €150 baseline in 2002 figures by 2007 and to increase the old age pension to a level of approximately €200. We are well on target to deal with that and that shows the Government's determination to address the issue of income poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">We must take into consideration some of CORI's policy views when reading its report, which are not necessarily reflected in the Government's NAPS agreement. Most particularly we are not comparing like with like. We have low unemployment, low long-term unemployment and an increasing elderly population but not to the same extent as in other EU countries. Moreover, the indicators used by the CORI report are based on the Living in Ireland survey and not necessarily on the way in which we determine the figure through the consistent poverty indicators. I do not agree with the Deputy's view that we are not supporting those who are vulnerable, financially or otherwise.</p>

     <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     the number of disallowed payments in the year to date, that had been made under differently applying rules in 2003.

            <p eId="para_144">I understand the question relates to the effect of the measures announced in November 2003 in the context of the 2004 Estimates. These measures included changes to the back to education allowance, one parent family payments and certain child dependant allowances, changes in the conditions of entitlement to short-term social insurance payments and changes in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including rent supplements thereunder.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">In some instances, including the back to education allowance and certain changes in unemployment benefit, the changes have not yet come into operation. In other cases where changes have been implemented, it is not possible to quantify precisely the numbers affected by the measures in question in that where there are disallowances, the specific reasons for them may not be recorded on computer payment systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">Data is available in most cases on numbers in receipt of the relevant payments immediately before the measures were introduced and the current position. This data supplies some indication of the number of persons affected but it is important to note that the number in receipt of payments on any particular scheme can fluctuate for a wide variety of reasons, such as, for example, seasonal factors in the case of unemployment. As regards the one parent family payment scheme, where transitional half-rate payments were discontinued, there are now 460 recipients of such payments, a reduction of 120. In respect of short-term social insurance claims, the period for linking claims to previous claims was increased from 13 weeks to 26 weeks. The number of linked claims has increased by 2,800 to 21,900. The earnings threshold for payment of graduated rates of short-term social insurance was raised from €88.88 to €150 to restore the previous relationship with standard rates of payment. The number of graduated rates of payment has increased by 2,000 to 8,500. It is not possible to establish the numbers affected by the increase from 39 to 52 weeks in the number of paid contributions required for entitlement to benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">In the case of child dependant allowance payments to recipients of disability and unemployment benefit, there were some 63,000 payments of half-rate allowance in payment in cases where the spouse-partner of the recipient was in employment and earning more than €210 per week, the then limit. This allowance was discontinued where earnings exceed €300 per week. The number of such allowances now in payment is 46,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_149">In the case of supplementary welfare allowance, the numbers of rent supplement payments have decreased since the beginning of 2004 to 58,100, a drop of 1,900. The number of crèche supplements has fallen from 1,800 to 1,450, the number of MABS supplements from 370 to 240 and the number of diet supplements from 13,580 to 13,180.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">I re-emphasise that the changes in numbers outlined may be due in part to factors other than the policy changes made. I am satisfied the measures in question have been implemented in a way which respects the original purpose of the schemes and services in question. Furthermore, these measures produced savings which, in turn, were directly reinvested in a substantial 2004 budget package of €630 million. A budget package of this magnitude enabled the provision of increases well ahead of inflation for all social welfare recipients of weekly payments as well as significant general improvements in social welfare provision generally.</p>

            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_151">I found many aspects of the Minister's reply unsatisfactory. It seems her Department is not collecting statistics on areas about which she does not want to know. She does not seem to want to know the number of people who will be homeless as a result of her rent supplement measures, the number of women and single parent families that will be affected by the crèche supplement and the number of crèches that are likely to be closed or the number of people who will lose out on the opportunity of further education as a result of moves in respect of the back to education supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">In light of today's news that €500 million has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the voluntary disclosure scheme and that tax receipts are running far beyond budget projections, is the Minister not embarrassed that the cuts were introduced in the first instance. Why does she not have the political courage to rescind the remainder of the cuts? She was forced, by Members on this side of the House, to rescind the cuts relating to widows' payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">Does the Minister agree with the view of her Cabinet colleague that inequality is good for the economy? I find her silence on that issue utterly inexplicable, particularly in light of the drubbing the Government has just received for the type of philosophies and policies it is pursuing to the detriment of the alienated and dispossessed in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_154">It is not my intention to reverse or change any of the agreements that were made. I am not entitled to do so because many of them were agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. As regards current economic buoyancy, it is not my intention, nor am I in a position, to reverse or change any proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">In respect of information being available, as the Deputy is aware, many statistics cannot be determined on the basis of other criteria. As regards changes in the social insurance fund, the permutations in social insurance cannot be seen until such time as they can be effected.

The additional part of my reply to this question to be included in the official report and my reply to Question No. 69 provides the information requested by the Deputy on crèche supplements.</p>

I am stating that the Government's addressing of the issue of inequity is exemplary, particularly on the basis that we have increased the social welfare fund to €11.3 billion this year. There was an increase of €630 million last year. In comparative terms, I have the greatest budgetary support from the Cabinet. Outside of the Department of Finance, my Department is the largest spending Department. On the basis of low unemployment and a not huge increase in the elderly population, the policy of the Government is to address inequality through income supports and reforms.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_83" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_159">My Department has overall responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing difficulty in meeting repayments on borrowings. There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service. The MABS programme provides money advice to individuals and families who have problems with debt and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. The latest information available from the MABS companies shows that some 12,000 people are currently availing of the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">The MABS service does not provide financial assistance to its customers. Rather, it places an emphasis on practical budget-based measures that help people to move permanently from dependence on moneylenders and to access alternative sources of low cost credit. In 2003 I provided €9.9 million for the operation of the MABS service and an additional €1.01 million was allocated for 2004 in the budget. MABS supplement payments paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme were made by the health boards because the people concerned had entered into repayment arrangements that were so onerous they did not have enough income left to meet their basic needs. Some 240 people, representing less than 2% of MABS' customers, were in receipt of these supplements at 4 June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">These supplements have not been used at all in three health board regions and were rarely used by the health boards serving the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow region. The practice established in these areas, which cover the majority of the State's population, is now being put in place throughout the country. I emphasise that MABS supplements currently in payment are not being withdrawn. Payment of the supplement in these cases, will continue for the duration of their current term of agreement. At the time the decision was taken to discontinue the MABS supplement, more than 50% of the supplements in payment had been in payment for more than a year and almost 25% of recipients had been in receipt of the supplement for more than two years. The duration of these payments confirms that the supplement had become a long term arrangement which is effectively a subsidy for creditors. The MABS companies throughout the country provide support and expertise in a way that best assists people in sorting out their debts. They will continue to provide their services to people who need them.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">In the circumstances, I am satisfied the decision to discontinue the MABS supplement is reasonable and will require creditors to take a more realistic approach to making repayment arrangements which debtors can afford to meet. Health boards may still deal with emergency or exceptional cases at any time by way of exceptional or urgent needs payments.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_84">
            <from>Mr. Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_163">MABS is one of the better initiatives introduced by the Department. It was put in place because of the outcry many years ago from the thousands of people living on working class housing estates who, at Christmas and other difficult times of the year — for example, when their children returned to school — had to approach moneylenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">I have spoken to community welfare officers who have informed me that what the Minister is doing is short-sighted. It benefited people who were caught in a trap and gave health boards an opportunity to help them rather than have them borrowing from moneylenders. The health board and MABS were able to work out a payment arrangement for people in financial difficulty. Health boards could provide assistance towards partial payment of debts. The arrangement was that the health board did not pay if the person being assisted did not honour his or her part of the agreement. Was it not preferable to have these people helped by health boards rather than have them involved with moneylenders? Moneylenders had to be paid on demand thus leaving a shortfall of money for food and other bills and allowing families to get into further difficulties which impacted on children.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">Community welfare officers need discretion to make decisions in difficult cases. I urge the Minister to leave that element of discretion in the legislation. The amount of money saved will only be €0.7 million, which is a small amount. It is a good scheme which worked well and should be left in place. I urge the Minister to ensure discretion is given to community welfare officers to judge where payment should be made by the health board. This would be preferable to having people borrow money from moneylenders. Banks and other financial institutions will not give it to them because they are already in difficulty. The Minister should ensure community welfare officers will have discretion in such matters without contravening the law.</p>

            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_166">There will not be any change for those currently in receipt of payments. Community welfare officers can exercise discretion. A culture arose in certain health board areas, particularly in the south, that exceptional needs payments were given over a period of weeks rather than in their entirety for the purpose of paying off a debt. There is some merit in that approach, in that the individuals concerned were empowered to deal with their debt. On the basis of meeting people in the south, I agreed with them that we would examine the issue under the SWA advisory group with a view to how best to deal with it. However, I do not wish a culture to develop whereby the State is paying for people's personal debt at their expense rather than the expense of creditors. Effective protocols and good working relationships exist between the parties and the companies concerned. I pay particular tribute to credit unions that have been fantastic in working with MABS. We have been able to successfully support many people and give them the necessary skills to manage their finances on the basis of empowerment through the companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">It is not the intention to take a certain amount of money to deal with an issue. That is not the way to do it. I gave an undertaking that we might proceed on the basis of the way in which the exceptional needs payment is used. Exceptional needs payments made in consultation with the MABS service can still continue.</p>

     <b>Mr. Penrose</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     if there has been further progress made in implementing the 15 recommendations contained in November 2003 report, The Position of Full-Time Carers, from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, specifically the recommendation for the abolition of the means test for the carer’s allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
     [17896/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_86" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_169">Supporting carers in society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">The long-term care agenda is an important aspect of social policy with major financial and other implications and I am determined, together with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, to move this agenda on by developing a framework for the future of long-term care. The report of the Oireachtas committee, which I have examined, makes a range of recommendations, many of which relate to my Department and a number of which concern the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and are financially sustainable within the resources available to me. The Oireachtas joint committee's report recommends the abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance, which could cost in the region of €180 million per annum. It is questionable whether it would be the best use of such resources in light of other competing demands. I accept there are differing views on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">Carer's benefit is a social insurance payment for a person who leaves employment to care for another person and which lasts for up to 15 months. The committee proposed the 15 months limit should be waived where the person continues to provide care. In this regard present arrangements include the provision of job-protected leave of absence for up to 15 months with employers obliged to maintain the employee's employment rights for this period. Any extension of carer's benefit would, in addition to the direct cost implications, have implications for carer's leave as well. I consider 15 months to be a reasonable period of leave in the circumstances. If there is an ongoing care requirement, a person may be entitled to carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">The committee also recommended improvements in the information available to carers. I am pleased to have been able to provide funding of €18,000 to the Carer's Association towards the publication and distribution of a new information pack which will provide information about services and supports for carers and their families. The information pack is currently being complied by the association and will be distributed throughout the country in libraries, health board offices, clinics, citizen information centres and social welfare offices by the end of the year. It will contain important information on the services and supports available to carers and their families. The committee also made a number of specific recommendations on the respite care grant and other issues relating to carers which will be considered in the context of future improvements in the scheme in a budgetary context.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_175">Regarding the long-term care agenda, I note the committee has examined the, Study to Examine the Future Financing of Long-term Care in Ireland, which I launched last year. My Department recently circulated a consultation document on this study, which aims to focus interested parties on the specific complex issues we need to address in the policy development process. These include benefit design, delivery, cost and financing, which are discussed at length in the report. The document has been circulated to more than 70 interested parties including the Oireachtas committees, health boards, interest groups and the social partners. These organisations and groups have been asked to consider a number of issues and to reply to the Department by 16 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">The analysis of the feedback from this process will be the starting point for meeting the commitment in Sustaining Progress in regard to examining the strategic policy, cost and service delivery issues associated with the care of older people. I hope the working group to conduct this examination can be established in October 2004.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_87">
            <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_177">What is required is additional social expenditure in this area. A total of €500 million in additional revenue has come into the coffers of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy and Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has said there is more to come. I appeal to the Minister not to allow social expenditure to become the victim of the straitjacket of the Minister for Finance's ideological thinking. That is the kernel of the issue. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs requires €250 million. Why does she not get some of it in order to abolish the means test, introduce a comprehensive system of needs assessment for carers, shift a significant portion of resources to home care subvention and give respite care to all carers?</p>
            <p eId="para_178">Some 50% of carer's allowance should be paid where a person who provides care is a recipient of widow's or widower's social welfare payments. With the reversal of the decision on widow's and widower's payments and the one family payment, we have already established it is possible to pay 50%.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">While canvassing for the election I met a widow who was a carer. She was in tears, not for financial reasons but because she felt nobody cared about her although she is saving the State millions of euros. There are many more like her. If the Minister wants to find out why the Government did badly in the election, she should ask the 150,000 carers across the country who feel let down. As I previously indicated in the House, I do not intend to let them down. I will fight for them in every corner to articulate their concerns. All they want is recognition. Will the Minister please give it to them? When the Minister goes to see the Minister for Finance in six weeks' time, we will be in her corner. Let us take on this right-wing ideology that deprives 150,000 carers of something that only amounts to token recognition in any event. I urge the Minister to do the right thing and look after carers. She has started to do this by taking one of the committee's recommendations on board but there are a number of other issues that need to be prioritised. Will the Minister please implement that report, which is an all-party committee report? I would be surprised if the matter does not rear its head this evening at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">Some of the Deputy's colleagues might not be too enamoured with that. I appreciate the Deputy has a personal regard for the issue of carers. Yes, I implemented the initial recommendation. As the Deputy is aware, we are also examining the issue of long-term care. I asked the committee to reply to me by 16 July with its views. I also asked others to be part of that discussion. We reviewed the issue of carer's allowance. A number of issues have been raised <i>ad infinitum</i> on the floor of the House; one is the respite care grant which gives a great deal of solace to people, another is the situation of widows and widowers. A high proportion of people over 65 are caring for people.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">No doubt one would easily obtain political gain on the fundamental issue of the removal of the means test. However, I am not sure it is the right thing to do. It is suggested we remove the means test on the basis of inequity. However, there will equally be inequality where people who have more than adequate resources to pay will be included in the scheme. We must analyse the fundamental questions of whether somebody who earns €500,000 is entitled to obtain the carer's allowance if he or she fulfils all the other requirements and whether that is the best use of resources. Many of us would rightly question that entitlement. We will always have a means test as a consequence. This is the fundamental issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">We saw the implications of the abolition of a means test in other decisions, for example the issue of the free medical card to people over 70 years of age. That was good, progressive and warranted. However, many people over the age of 70 are multimillionaires. My view is that we should increase the thresholds adequately to ensure that more people can avail of the carer's allowance. I wholeheartedly support progress in this area and believe home care subvention is an important advance in dealing with the issue of the increase in our elderly population which will come about over the next 20 years.</p>

     <b>Mr. McGinley</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     her views on whether the free schemes package should be renamed, now that the schemes are no longer free; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
     [17657/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_92" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_187">The household benefits package of schemes comprises the electricity, natural gas and bottled gas allowances, telephone allowance and free TV licence. Apart from the TV licence scheme which meets the full cost of the annual licence, the household benefit allowances have always represented contributions towards the cost of household utility bills, rather than full coverage of all costs. They are intended to meet the standing charges and a certain fixed amount of electricity consumption, gas consumption or telephone calls respectively. The extent to which these bills are met by the allowance depends on the individual household usage pattern.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">This package of allowances is valued by social welfare clients as a significant contribution to their periodic household bills. The allowances are not, and were never, entirely free; the utility companies must be reimbursed by my Department on normal commercial terms for the allowances they apply as credits on eligible customer bills. There is a significant ongoing cost to the taxpayer, estimated at €280 million this year. My Department continually negotiates to obtain the best commercial terms and value for money for this very sizeable annual expenditure on the household benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The qualifying conditions for the various individual allowances were harmonised in 2002 and renamed as the household benefits package. The purpose of this was to ensure that a customer who qualified for one allowance could qualify for all of them. The introduction of this package also meant that there would be just one application form to be filled out by a person wishing to avail of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">In October 2003 I introduced a further change to the telephone allowance which may be what the Deputy is referring to in this question. The structure of the allowance was changed to make it a cash credit on bills and not attributable to any particular component of the bill. Previously the allowance had covered the line and instrument rental charges specifically, along with a small element of call costs on each two-monthly client bill. The change I introduced makes it easier for eligible clients to switch from Eircom to another participating service provider if they so desire. If they so choose, the newly standardised allowance can be applied to phone bills from the service provider irrespective of the tariff components.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">In conjunction with this change, a special "bundle rate", the Eircom social benefits scheme was negotiated with Eircom. It provides telephone allowance customers with line and equipment rental plus an enhanced call credit of up to €5.35 worth of free calls per two-month billing period. The cost of the bundle gave better value for money to my Department for the ongoing expenditure on these services. ComReg approved a price increase application from Eircom of 7.5% in line rental, effective from 4 February 2004. A lesser percentage increase was also applied to telephone instrument rental where applicable. Following detailed discussions between my Department and Eircom, it was agreed that the increase in the Eircom social benefits scheme would be limited to CPI of 1.9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_193">Some technical restructuring was also introduced by Eircom which removed some additional call unit value. To offset this, Eircom offered to give low use customers up to €10.00 worth of calls free per two-month bill, by offering them its separate "low users" scheme in addition to the social benefit scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">The higher Eircom charges have resulted in an increase to the social welfare customer of 94 cent, including VAT, per two-monthly bill, less than 12 cent per week. This is much lower than the increase applicable to other households. The other revisions to call costs by Eircom should be broadly beneficial to welfare customers, particularly those who are low call users.</p>

            <p eId="para_198">I want the Minister to return to her Department on this scheme. The principle of the scheme was that the service was free and people did not have to pay for the rental. Many people are now confused. The new charges are creating problems because people do not know what the extra charge is for. Some of them have not paid it because they think it is a mistake and the charge is building up. I urge the Minister to go back to her Department to find the small amount of money it would cost to leave this as a free scheme. She should not talk about ComReg or regulators. I am sick and tired of regulators because when I put a question to Ministers the usual reply is that the Minister has no responsibility for regulators.</p>

It was good that we had the free scheme in the past and that people knew the rental was free. That is no longer the case and people now have to pay a charge every two months.

            <p eId="para_202">ComReg agreed a 7.5% increase in line charges. I negotiated with the Department to reduce that to 1.9% on the basis that we had introduced a number of changes. Many people on social welfare are low users of the scheme and this is why Eircom has provided a special package for people. It is called a "bundle" and costs €20.41 plus VAT per month, great value for money for those people who avail of it. The amount of money involved in the change is very small, 94 cent every two-monthly bill, which is just a few cent per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">The scheme known as the household benefits scheme does not cover the entire costs. Whether we like regulation or not, I must provide for competition within the scheme and I have done that. On the basis of that competition we have negotiated not only with the main providers of telephone services but also with mobile phone providers to use that money specifically to provide the best deal that can be obtained for the customer. It is on that basis that the changes have taken place.</p>

     <b>Mr. Rabbitte</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     if she has received a response from the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to her letter concerning protection for elderly persons in financial dealings; her views on whether anything can be done to protect the elderly from losing out on pension schemes by borrowing money against their homes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_104" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_210">I wrote to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority with regard to the situation of people who borrow against their home to free up equity and whose entitlement to a pension may be affected as a result. I was interested in particular in the issue of independent financial advice in such cases, including advice on the possible effects on pension entitlements. I have received a reply from the Irish Financial Services Regulations Authority and I am informed that the position is as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">There is currently no obligation or requirement on the financial institution to advise a customer to take independent financial advice on lifetime mortgages. However, the authority has informed me that it is currently developing codes of conduct for all financial services providers and has included in its consultation process issues with regard to the protection of financially vulnerable persons. It hopes to have this code finalised before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">At present two companies offer equity release type products on the Irish market, known as home reversion schemes. Since these products involve selling part of a person's home, rather than taking out a loan, I am informed they do not fall within the remit of the financial services regulator. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is aware of and considering this issue which was brought to his attention by the regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_213">I am aware from documentation received in my Department from one of the two companies that it does draw customers' attention to the possible effect on social welfare entitlements. I would also like to make clear that my Department has always set out its position in reply to any queries received over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">The issues raised overall in this regard in respect of consumer protection are of serious concern and I am awaiting the outcome of consideration by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Department of Finance in this regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_105">
            <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_215">The equity release type policies are a new phenomenon and many people could be vulnerable in this position. They may have bought their homes 30 years ago and are now in their 60s. Their home is now a significant appreciating asset against which they may be borrowing substantial sums. Codes of practice are all very well but there have been some fairly drastic revelations over the past six to 12 months regarding financial institutions advising people or not advising them. When all hell breaks loose, there is only one loser and it is the ordinary people who are left carrying the baby. The borrowers or the investors in the various financial institutions always seem to get off scot free. There are many harrowing tales of other people suffering. We do not wish to see a repeat of that in this type of new phenomenon. It is useful, provided the necessary protection is afforded to people.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">I suggest that the Minister has a meeting with the Minister for Finance and IFSRA and that the code of conduct which is a voluntary code, should be put on a statutory footing to ensure that those elderly people in particular who might be vulnerable are clearly informed of their rights and their responsibilities and what may happen in the future. Independent advice regarding the legal situation and their pension entitlements should be proffered to them at each and every step. In particular, the impact on non-contributory pensions of borrowing substantial amounts of money should be explained. This could affect people's livelihoods and life experience for years.</p>

            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_217">I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy. It was on the basis of my concerns that I raised this with IFSRA. We will continue to keep on eye on this matter. This matter was also raised in the United Kingdom and was the cause of serious concerns. A code of conduct and consultation process has been instituted there and we will monitor progress made as it is of interest to us. It is my intention to keep a very close eye on this issue. The Deputy is correct in saying that people do not realise capital means are being taken. They do not realise that they would be better off taking out a loan for such a short-term gain.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">I wish to compliment <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> which reported the case of a couple who along with their daughter borrowed €250,000. Due to the fact that they had a Bank of Ireland Life loan they lost their weekly pension of €260. People have to be protected. We saw the code of practice which applies to banks. It is time the Minister and the Minister for Finance introduced the necessary legislation which includes plenty of penalties for banks if they do not obey the law of the land. Elderly and vulnerable people and everyone borrowing money from banks must be protected by the State because banks cannot be depended upon any longer.</p>

            <p eId="para_221">Will the Minister accept that this is a problem affecting the elderly that goes beyond pensions and mortgage products which are being marketed? Will she agree there might be a role for MABS, given other press reports that some banks have encouraged elderly people with current accounts to take liquid assets out of safe investment products and put their savings into risky investment products? There is a need not only for a code of conduct but strong regulation in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_222">It was on the basis of my concerns that I raised it with the regulator and the Department of Finance. At present, credit is very much in your face. Despite all the supports and regulations and warnings to read the small print, people panic. MABS is at hand to give financial advice and people should obtain independent financial advice either from a professional or from the service provided by the Department. There are people who are not accustomed to dealing with red tape and do not realise the implications of what they are doing. It is my intention to pursue this matter vigorously and to ensure that people are aware of the implications of their decisions.</p>

            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_228">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 94, 99, 611 and 612 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">The main objective of the measures I introduced to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to re-focus the scheme on its original objective which is to meet immediate short-term income maintenance needs as opposed to long-term needs. The principal changes relate to rent supplement Statutory Instrument 728 of 2003, which gives effect to the main rent supplement measures. As a result of these changes people applying for rent supplement will have their housing needs assessed by the local authorities in a systematic manner and this should increase their chances of getting social housing where appropriate. Subject to the normal means assessment and other qualifying criteria, a person who is assessed by a housing authority as having a housing need will qualify for rent supplement regardless of how long that person has been renting.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">With certain very important exceptions, it is no longer possible for a person to become a tenant in the private rented sector with the support of rent supplement unless the local authority is satisfied that the person has a housing need. The impact of this and the other measures was fully assessed and the manner of their implementation was carefully designed to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups such as the homeless, the elderly and disabled are fully protected. The six months prior renting requirement does not apply in their case. Community welfare officers who administer the schemes have been kept fully apprised of the changes. A circular was issued by my Department to the health boards last December in which the details of the changes to the SWA scheme were set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">My Department has been in regular contact with the community welfare staff of the health boards both prior to and since the introduction of the measures in January. These contacts range from daily telephone and e-mail exchanges to informal meetings as well as more formal structured meetings at which the operation of the new measures has been discussed. In addition to the ongoing contacts between my Department and the health boards, a working group has been established under the Sustaining Progress agreement to facilitate engagement with the social partners in respect of monitoring the impact of the recent changes to the scheme. The working group, which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, includes representatives from ICTU and the community and voluntary pillar as well as my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">Details of rent supplement applications refused on grounds of failure to meet the new criteria are not maintained on my Department's computer system. However, my Department requested the health boards to examine a sample of applications for rent supplement which were refused since last January in order to monitor the impact of the changes. Of the 242 cases examined, 25 were refused on account of the new measures. It is not known how may of these cases appealed against the original decision or what the outcomes were in any such appeals. The savings arising from these measures derive from refusals of claims, where the applicant does not fulfil the new requirements, and also from instances where people do not submit a claim but make alternative arrangements to meet these needs. For that reason, it is not possible to state exactly how much has been saved so far this year as a result of the new rent supplement measures. The total savings for the year are estimated at €12 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">My Department has not been made aware of any cases of hardship arising from the application of the new measures. None of the measures which I have introduced affect the discretion of a health board to provide assistance where a board considers that the circumstances of a particular case warrant treatment as an exceptional measure.</p>

            <from>Mr. Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_234">These cutbacks have been in place for the last six months. Has the Minister had a recent meeting with the community welfare officers and if she has, what was the feedback from that meeting? What concerns, if any, did they express and what are their reactions to the working of the new changes? Has the Minister had a meeting with the housing groups, the people who monitor the situation on a daily basis? When the Minister made this announcement, she met with a number of groups who came together and who were concerned about the cutbacks. Has the Minister had a meeting with those groups in the last six months and what is the feedback from those groups? Has the Minister a report for the House? She stated she would report back to the House on the effects of the cutbacks.</p>

            <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_235">I have had ongoing discussions with many groups, both within and without Sustaining Progress. On the basis of those discussions, it was agreed to set up a monitoring group, the composition of which I alluded to earlier. My Department will be involved in the group which will be facilitated and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. We are, therefore, examining the implications and impact of these decisions not only in my Department but also under the auspices of Sustaining Progress. It is my intention to continue to keep in touch with people.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">With regard to meeting community welfare officers and housing authorities, while I have not personally met representatives of the former group, formal and informal discussions are ongoing between my Department and officials and representative groups. Although the housing authorities do not fall under the auspices of the Department, we have been in touch and I have met the Minister of State with responsibility for housing on a number of occasions to progress our action plan. One of the greatest benefits of these contacts has been the current tremendous interaction between the health boards and housing officers in dealing with housing. In the majority of areas, the application form and information provided are uniform. The continuation of this co-operation and the implementation of the proposed action plan by my Department and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing will address many of the long-term issues which prevent people who are unfortunately reliant on long-term SWA rent supplement from receiving the best supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_237">The Minister stated that her Department is not aware of increased hardship. I do not mean to insult her but she should talk to the groups involved in the housing issue, for example, the Simon Community, Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The reality is that the average cost of accommodation is €121 per week, which is above the cap. People are, therefore, conspiring with their landlords by dipping into their social welfare payments to pay for rent increases. The Minister must be aware of this problem from her clinics. An increasing number of people who come to me and other Deputies are using their social welfare, borrowing or being subsidised by their families to pay rents.</p>
            <p eId="para_238">The latest report on Dublin by the Simon Community showed that not one person moved from transitional, temporary accommodation into social housing. Why is this? The reason is that housing is not being built and made available to those who need it. If the Department is not aware of increased hardship, it is living in a different world.</p>

Moreover, I have had numerous meetings with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing — I do not have time to check them out — to examine the action plan to progress this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_245">As regards Deputy Durkan's question, having analysed every parliamentary question he has tabled to me, it is obvious he has a problem with the community welfare officer in Kildare because that seems to be the crux of the issue. With regard to his specific question, which I have answered three times, the woman in question had another child and, as a consequence, received an increase in child dependant allowance and one parent family allowance. Rent allowance is determined by income and the rent allowance of the woman in question was reduced because she received an increase in income. I have answered the question three times and if the Deputy is not happy, I would be delighted to give him the permutations on which such decisions are made.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">By way of introduction, I refer to the Taoiseach's comment yesterday arising from the results of the local and European elections that Sinn Féin was the winner of the elections. The Fine Gael Party now has the highest number of Members of the European Parliament. The local election results, when compared with the general election results of two years ago, show a 5% increase in Fine Gael support, with Independents gaining 2% and Sinn Féin 1.5%, while the Fianna Fáil Party lost almost 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The Taoiseach and his Ministers have stated that the Fianna Fáil Party will reflect upon the consequences of the elections, listen to the people and take into account the verdict handed down. Does the Taoiseach not accept that the results of the European and local elections amount to a devastating indictment of his Government? The perception which came across clearly to Opposition parties was that the Government is out of touch, has grown too comfortable, arrogant and removed from the people in office and that its decisions are based on looking after itself and its supporters rather than dealing with the concerns, anger and frustration of ordinary people. In view of the devastating loss to his party and the fact that Deputies from his party are arguing for the Minister of Finance to be got rid of and the purse strings released for more spending, does the Taoiseach not accept that the consequence of yesterday's results amounts to a serious loss of confidence in his Government and in him? What does he propose to do about it?</p>

          <p eId="para_252">As I acknowledged yesterday, the Government, at least the main party, Fianna Fáil, did not do well in the elections. I said that very clearly yesterday. Our colleagues, the Progressive Democrats, increased their vote by 1%. I acknowledge Deputy Kenny's party won five seats in the European elections and I have no difficulty in congratulating him on that. I said that in the local elections, from a very low base, his party decreased its vote by 0.6%. That was the figure published on the front page of the national newspapers yesterday. If my party had spent about 15 years in Opposition, I would certainly not consider it a great victory. Fine Gael did better in the European election.</p>

It did not affect this country as badly as it could have. There was no dramatic increase in unemployment, and we managed to stabilise ourselves and maintain tax rates while still attracting some foreign direct investment. While it was a difficult two years internationally, we managed our way through that. Public expenditure has been reduced from more than 20% to 6%.

The company provides the most highly skilled jobs in the world in information technology.

Ireland is the fourth best location for foreign direct investment by US companies. Employment is still growing and these facts are very positive.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Is the Taoiseach aware the Progressive Democrats campaigned in the local elections — they were not involved in the European election — on the basis that decentralisation was "a Fianna Fáil idea"? Is he also aware of Deputy Fiona O'Malley's statement that she would bring the reaction of her constituents to the attention of the Tánaiste? Have the Taoiseach's former councillors in the Dublin area, who fell like nine pins, reported back to him on this issue? Decentralisation in the fashion announced opportunistically in the budget by the Minister for Finance is simply unworkable. Is a review contemplated?</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I refer to one example, which is the Tánaiste's Department. She said of 503 staff who replied to a survey, 69 agreed to go to Carlow, of 413 Dublin-based FÁS staff, 30 were prepared to go to Birr, and of 110 staff who replied to a survey by the Health and Safety Authority, 90 said "no", 15 said "yes" and two said "maybe". That is an improvement on Mitchelstown where the promise to relocate 200 Bus Éireann staff has fallen through because the company's management discovered it only employs 80. How does the Taoiseach reconcile this with the commitment made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon? He told us during the winter months that, as soon as there was a stretch in the evenings, civil servants would oversubscribe to move to various locations, and it would be a case of "follow me up to Carlow" and they would all follow the Minister of State. Having regard to the unfeasibility of this daft, old fashioned Fianna Fáil stroke, will a review be undertaken?</p>

          <p eId="para_277">It is always interesting to hear the way issues are raised. For four or five years as the last round of decentralisation was completed, various Members representing Dublin, other urban centres and rural areas asked whether it would be undertaken again, whether it was dead and buried and whether we had the heart to reform the public service. A decade ago it was said we would never achieve the number of people we sought to decentralise. Decentralisation must work, it must be organised and difficulties will arise. The Government is committed to decentralisation and the process that has been outlined. We announced the central applications facility that is being provided by the Civil Service Commission. It will show what is feasible and how we make assessments. We will work our way through that. I do not think it is a daft idea. The reality of the city, the national spatial strategy and balanced regional development is that Dublin cannot continue indefinitely to grow at the rate of the last ten to 15 years. That is not a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">At the same time the western seaboard, an enormous part of the country, has excellent potential. It has a good infrastructure which is improving under the capital programme, but it is experiencing depopulation. That is not good for the country, nor is the fact that of our 4 million people 1.8 million live in the greater Dublin area. We have to lead and the best way in which the Government can lead is by following the national spatial strategy and by putting good infrastructure in the regions, making it possible to get to peripheral locations. We need to provide good services, in electricity, telecommunications, broadband and so on, for the regions and the State itself must make an effort to move as much of central Government to the regions as it can. That is what we are engaged in.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Deputy Rabbitte was actively and constructively engaged in negotiation in a previous position. We have to negotiate on these matters and we will do so. Over a short period of time we will deal with these issues. We have set out the process and we will endeavour to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I did not ask the Taoiseach whether decentralisation was a good idea or not. Balanced regional development is manifestly a good thing but I asked about the decentralisation package announced by the Minister for Finance. I asked whether the Taoiseach intends, in light of the fallout from the election, to review it and to acknowledge that it is neither feasible nor in the interests of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">To quote Dr. Ed Walsh, it may be good for some local towns in Ireland but bad for Ireland. Governance will not be possible. It will lead to the destruction of specialist agencies. One cannot seek to relocate professional staff in a particular niche area and replace them with generalist civil servants from another area. If Ministers are going around beating their breasts and saying they have learnt lessons, what lesson has the Taoiseach learnt in respect of decentralisation? Is there to be a review or not? Is he now saying decentralisation is voluntary? He should not tell me it was always voluntary, as it has been made quite clear to staff that they have no choice and that their promotional prospects will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Minister for Defence is engaged in a legal process to compel somebody to transfer to premises owned by a Fianna Fáil councillor in Roscrea and there are other examples. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is running around like a demented auctioneer with a gavel, willing to sell anything that will come under the hammer.

We are trying to make the regions modern and yes, there are difficulties. However, there will be no knee-jerk reaction that we will not do anything. If we do that we will never solve health service problems, we will never advance third level education and we will not continue to modernise the country. That is not what I want.

Reports on divisions within his Government show clearly that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are not singing from the same hymn sheet on a number of matters. I refer particularly to the statement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which expressed Progressive Democrat policy to the effect that inequality is good for the economy. If the Taoiseach agrees with that, where stands Sustaining Progress, which states that a central theme of the agreement is the building of a fair and inclusive society to ensure people have resources and opportunities to live life with dignity? Do we understand that this in effect means unequal opportunities?</p>

          <p eId="para_300">There are a lot of questions there. The Government implements equality measures — we spent €11.3 billion in the welfare budget driving equality measures, while we spent €500 million on social disadvantage in education. All our policies and resources go into trying to reduce poverty. Deputy Sargent will know that surveys show poverty is at historically low levels. We have raised the lowest rates of social welfare by almost two thirds and we have had the largest social welfare and child benefit increases ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Deputy Sargent asked about my views on the second airport terminal. It is a good idea if it has private sector involvement. How it is structured and run is a matter for debate and discussion with the trade unions, which is important to resolve, but I agree with the idea of bringing in more people and having more jobs, with proper conditions, in the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Deputy asked where I stood on the bus licence issue. That is simple — I have been involved with the CityWest Business Complex from the day it started and it has 110 companies which employ up to 6,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Dublin Bus was invited by the management of CityWest to lay on bus services directly to the business campuses for some of those 6,000 people who travel by public transport. In fairness to Deputy Sargent, he is consistent in that regard. Dublin Bus expressed no interest in providing the service so the management of CityWest approached a private operator, Morton's Coaches, which duly applied to the Department for two Dublin bus licences. Dublin Bus expressed no interest yet some of its workers want to go into dispute over it which is madness. That is where I stand on that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I asked the Taoiseach specifically about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell's comments on inequality being good for the economy. Does the Taoiseach agree with that? What is his position on fostering inequality? Does he agree, as was mentioned on Question Time, that, according to a graph by the European Commission on percentage divergence in national social protection expenditure levels in the EU, Ireland in terms of GNP and GDP is at the bottom of the league in regard to social protection and equality? Will the Taoiseach confront the view which is gaining credence in his Government that inequality is good for the economy? Does he agree that countries such as Sweden, France and Germany, which are at the upper end of the scale in terms of proper provision for the services about which he often talks and which are countries where, as it so happens, the Green Party was in government, should be the model he should follow if he is determined to address the social deprivation which was a reason he lost so badly in this election?</p>

We have heard all about great countries and great health care. We always referred to the French system but one should look at what happened as soon as they faced a bit of a problem. The Swedes have their own problems with health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The Deputy asked me if we stood for inequality. No Government since the foundation of the State has done so much to level the base. That is why 1.8 million people, more than 60% of the adult population, is working. That is why we have so many people in third level education and why we expend resources all the time to help people who are disadvantaged. There are difficulties. I am not saying every issue has been resolved. However, I will not allow it to be said that there have not been huge advances. As the Deputy knows, 200,000 people have been lifted out of the poverty net. It is not correct to state we are at the bottom of the league. This country is not at the bottom of the league in any of those areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">The Government will have received the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments today. It has been a number of years since the Taoiseach remarked in the House in respect of former Deputy Ray Burke that a good man was hounded out of office. The report states that this tribunal could last for another 11 years in which case two or three general elections may be held. There is a number of recommendations in the report. Does the Government intend to consider them? Does the Taoiseach have any plans to expedite this as the public is growing weary of it week after week? Many back garden patios will be built in the next 11 years if it continues at this rate. There is a number of options open. Some cogent arguments have been made in the report as to how the matter could be expedited, whether through contract prices, extra judges, the closing of the terms of reference or whatever. This matter needs to be dealt with quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">When is it proposed to debate the legislation dealing with the consequences of the referendum on citizenship? Will it be in the autumn session? Will the Taoiseach give a guarantee that there will not be a time limit on the discussion on it and that it will include real debate in respect of a proper immigration policy?</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_318">How does the Taoiseach propose to handle the interim report from the Mahon tribunal? The Committee of Public Accounts was recently informed by the Department of Finance that the €116 million — it might be €111 million, although I think it is €116 million — is likely to be increased by between a factor of four and five to pay for already incurred third party costs. Is it the Government's intention to allow this to run so that we can expect to have a final report by the anniversary of 1916 and additional countless tens of millions of euros will be spent which will not perhaps add a great deal to the knowledge we already have of the malpractice that has taken place in this county? There is no reason to believe it has been restricted to this county.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">For example, why can we not refer the files and the cabinets of files there to the Garda Fraud Squad or equip it to take what actions it considers appropriate? Presumably, on issues where public hearings have been initiated they would have to be concluded, but surely it is a matter for the Oireachtas to seriously review whether we will chalk up €1 billion costs in this case. However, there are also five or six other tribunals sitting. How long does it take to establish whether there are lessons to be learned from the unfortunate shooting at Abbeylara or how much fertiliser has been ground in coffee pots in Donegal? Will the Taoiseach say whether he intends to involve the Opposition parties in discussing this and whether he intends to put any proposals to the House?</p>

          <p eId="para_323">There are two issues to deal with. Regarding Deputy Kenny's second question on the citizenship referendum, the Minister responsible will engage in discussions with the House prior to publication, perhaps during the summer months, and the legislation will be ready in the autumn. The Minister should be given adequate time to deal with that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Regarding the other matter about which Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte and Sargent asked me, the Government has only received this report. We will examine it. As Deputy Kenny pointed out, there are a number of recommendations in it. It clearly states with regard to its current terms of reference that the tribunal considers its remit does not afford it discretion as to which matters it is required to investigate. My reading of that is that because of that provision, the members of the tribunal have to investigate everything brought before them. That is not what the House had in mind in the autumn of 1997. At that stage there were a few issues and few more related issues arose. I am not saying what the members are investigating at present is not part of those issues. I accept, as Deputy Rabbitte said, that it is. It certainly was not the view of any of us who were involved in those discussions — I worked with the leaders of the Opposition of the day — that we would have the final report in 2014. In respect of a matter related to myself, I was told in 1998 that I would get the report in three months'. It seems that 2016 may also pass before we get it. I agree fully with Deputy Rabbitte on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The House set up the tribunal. It is incumbent on us — the report of the tribunal seems to state this — to decide what matters are on the tribunal's modules. The report also states that the current module should conclude around the time of the next Dáil. Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte will recall that when I increased the membership of the tribunal from one to three judges, it was my clear view that there would be a simultaneous operation with regard to the matters before it. I know from my experience that it is not that easy to remember what happened in 1988 and 1989. By the time the tribunal approaches 2018, I hope I will not be recalled because I probably definitely will not remember much.</p>

I would be prepared for us to sit down collectively to examine what modules we, as Members of this House, consider are important. I do not believe it is only a matter for the Government. If they are modules under investigation, I accept they will have to stay within that process. Others perhaps do not need investigation or we should refer them to a committee of the House. I would certainly be prepared to do that. It seems to be the sensible way to proceed. The process will have no credibility if we continue on this path.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_395">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The purpose of this Bill is to raise the ESB's statutory borrowing limit with the aim of facilitating the ESB's current major infrastructure investment programme. The ESB's existing borrowing limit stands at IR£1.6 billion. This is equivalent to €2.03 billion and has remained unchanged since 1982. The Bill proposes increasing this limit to €6 billion to take account of the reality of today's economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Management of the finances of the ESB is a matter for the board and management of the company. Towards the end of 2003, it became apparent that the existing borrowing limit was beginning to act as a severe constraint on the company. The company recognised that if it was to accomplish its significant capital programme, it would need to rely more extensively on its borrowing capacity and that it could not continue business as usual within the confines of the existing limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The ESB's borrowing level is at €1.9 billion, which is very close to the existing limit. While the company is employing tight management of its cash outflows, the remaining cash balance is expected to be exhausted within a matter of weeks. This is, of course, based on the assumption that there are no unexpected demands for cash within that period. The urgent passing of this legislation is therefore essential for the company to continue to operate effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Before going into the detail of the company's investment programme or of the Bill's provisions, I will refer to the ESB's financial results for 2003, which were published since this Bill passed all stages in the Seanad. As Deputies will be aware, the results revealed a healthy financial position in the company, with turnover up by 9% on the previous year. Profit after tax was also up on the previous year at €249 million with a resulting declared dividend of €67 million. It would be easy to make the assumption that these figures represent excessive profits, but this would be to ignore the complete picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The level of profits must be viewed in the context of the size of the company, which has fixed assets of nearly €5 billion. As mentioned earlier, the company's level of debt currently stands at €1.9 billion and this debt, which is set to increase over the coming years, needs to be serviced. The level of profits also needs to be viewed in the context of the company's capital expenditure programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">To put this expenditure programme in perspective, in 1982 when the borrowing limit was last set, the annual capital expenditure for the ESB was approximately £200 million, which is approximately €254 million. This year, the approved annual capital budget is approximately €1.4 billion, nearly six times what it was in 1982. This is an all-time high for the company and reflects the enormous range of infrastructural development being undertaken at this time. It should be noted, however, that the ESB sees this trend reaching its peak this year and then taking a downward turn over the next five years. By 2008, the company expects its capital spend to be approximately €650 million, about half the current level. This will bring the company back in line with its more normal spending patterns.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">As regards the proposals before the House today, I would like to put some perspective on the existing and proposed limit figures. The sum of €2.03 billion in 1982 terms is now approximately equivalent to €4.31 billion. The ESB has advised that its borrowings will increase to nearly €4 billion by 2008. Facilities of €1 billion are required for liquidity purposes. It is intended that these facilities will not be drawn down unless absolutely necessary. It is also proposed to factor in an additional €1 billion, thus bringing the limit to €6 billion in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Given the ever present pressures on Oireachtas time and on Government legislative programmes, the proposed limit is reasonable and prudent. It should be remembered that the current statutory limit had sufficient headroom built into it to cover the company for the past 22 years. It is envisaged that the actual requirements and the projected headroom built into the proposed new limit should meet the company's needs for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The ESB's debt strategy is designed to: ensure there is sufficient liquidity in the company; ensure flexible terms and conditions consistent with the achievement of the corporate strategy of the company; minimise the cost of debt while optimising the debt mix; develop strong relationships with a key group of banks; and ensure a diversity of funding sources. The ESB has many sources of financing including the European Investment Bank, syndicated facilities and bilaterals, leases, the private placement market and non-recourse financing. This range of different sources provides the company with the ability to avail of the best terms and keenest rates on offer. Keen funding rates underpin a more cost-effective capital expenditure programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The private placement arranged by the company in the United States last December has given the ESB a significant financial boost. The deal, which provided the company with $1 billion in finance at keen rates, is intended to fund major improvements in the power infrastructure in this country. The private placement market was an attractive option for the ESB because of the range of maturities and the competitive interest rates available. Two major banks, namely, ABN AMRO and Barclays Capital, jointly arranged the financial deal with principal participants being insurance companies and some pension funds. The very positive response of the private placement market reflects the ESB's high international standing and can also be seen as a vote of confidence in the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The ESB also entered into a separate €500 million revolving credit facility at the end of 2003. The facility, which was co-ordinated by the Royal Bank of Scotland, will be drawn on as and when necessary to ensure liquidity is constantly available and will therefore assist the ESB's overall funding programme. As I mentioned earlier, the main purpose of the increased borrowing limit is to fund the ESB's current major infrastructure investment programme. The proposed level of capital expenditure between 2004 and the end of 2008 is expected to be nearly €5 billion. This is designed to meet the strong increase in demand for electricity in the Irish market and will support development of the national economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">In 2003, the ESB invested more than €650 million in the network infrastructure in Ireland. The replacement and upgrading of almost 17,000 km of distribution network was completed and a record 77,000 new customers were connected to the system. For 2004, the company has a target of more than 20,000 km of network renewal scheduled for completion. The most recent forecast from the company for new connections in 2004 is that over 80,000 new customers will be connected to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The renewal and investment in the ESB's generation portfolio both here and abroad is continuing in line with the company's corporate strategy. During 2003, agreement was reached on the closure of the old peat-fired generating stations at Rhode, Shannonbridge, Lanesboro, Caherciveen and Bellacorick. Their decommissioning will take place as two new state-of-the-art peat stations at Lanesboro and Shannonbridge come into production later this year and early next year, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The ESB's international investment programme promotes the good reputation of the company among global energy utilities. Two major international power generation projects are expected to come to fruition shortly. These are the new 400 MW plant which will be commissioned in early 2005 in Coolkeeragh, County Derry, and a new 750 MW plant in Amorebieta, near Bilbao in northern Spain, which is due to be commissioned later that year.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">A decision on the future of the coal-fired station at Moneypoint will have to be made over the coming weeks. The ESB is considering what commercial decisions it should take as an investment of around €360 million would be required for emissions cleaning technology to ensure compliance with environmental obligations and maintaining the plant in operation for the long term. If Moneypoint is not to be upgraded to comply with the new environmental requirements, it must close by around 2011 and an alternative electricity generating plant, probably gas-fired, would have to be in place by that time. It has long been recognised by both the company and the Government that if the company is to justify major new investment in Moneypoint it must be in the context of benchmarked best practice in all respects. In this regard, I understand that agreement on a best practice agreement for the plant has now been reached locally between management and workers. I commend all the parties involved for their efforts in ensuring a swift and positive outcome on this issue, which is a prerequisite to securing the future of the plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">As I explained during the debate on this Bill in the Seanad, it was originally the intention to include the borrowing provision contained in this Bill in another new Bill called the energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2004. However, the Attorney General subsequently advised me that a Bill dealing solely with the ESB statutory borrowing issue would be more appropriate in view of the time constraint on getting this new legislative provision enacted. Hence, the legislation before the House today. The energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2004 will now be published later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The Bill before the House is a short one with only two sections. Section 1 is the main provision and gives effect to the change of limit to €6 billion by amending section 4(4) of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1954. This section of the 1954 Act was originally amended when the borrowing limit was raised to its current level of IR£1.6 billion by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1982. The new subsection (4) repeats exactly the wording of the existing subsection (4), except for the change from the amount in pounds to the new higher amount in euro. Given the nature of the amendment and the size of the provision, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel felt it more appropriate to re-state the subsection in its entirety with the new higher amount included as appropriate. I agree with this approach as it facilitates a clearer understanding of what is being proposed by all who will read this Bill. Transparency and clarity of understanding are key tenets of the Government's White Paper entitled Regulating Better and the approach being taken in this Bill is in line with those tenets.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Section 2 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill and is a standard drafting provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The ESB is one of our major State companies in terms of its sheer size and the manner in which it impacts on the day-to-day lives of every citizen and on the whole economy. Throughout its existence, the company has delivered its essential services to the country to the highest standards of public service. The company is now adapting itself to meet new challenges presented by a changing business environment brought on by market liberalisation and the demands of competitiveness and environmental change. I am confident the ESB will continue to serve the Irish people with the same level of commitment and professionalism it has historically displayed in providing the country with a high-quality electricity supply and infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I hope the foregoing provides Deputies with a clear understanding as to the background and need for this Bill, the early enactment of which is now a matter of urgency for the ESB. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_423">The purpose of this Bill is clearly to raise the ESB's statutory borrowing limit of £1.6 billion, which is approximately €2 billion, and has remained unchanged for 22 years. The thinking behind this Bill is to facilitate an upward revision of that limit to accommodate the increased borrowing requirement of the ESB at this time in order to fund an extensive capital expenditure programme. The new figure proposed in the Bill is €6 billion. As has been noted, there are no Exchequer implications for increasing the limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">On the face of it, this seems like a sensible approach but it is an opportunity to discuss in some detail the energy market in general and I have some concerns in regard to significantly increasing the borrowing limit available to the ESB. I will structure my comments around those the Minister made a number of months ago at a committee meeting. He stated that similar to the situation in most other countries, energy policy in Ireland is governed by three core policy objectives. They are ensuring the development of an efficient and properly regulated energy market to support Ireland's economic competitiveness and which provides customers with a choice of energy sources and supports economic growth, ensuring security of energy supply and ensuring that energy supply and use are environmentally sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I shall comment on how far down we are in regard to achieving any of those objectives and the present state of play? On the aim of an efficient and properly regulated market, we have had liberalisation of the energy market during the past five years. What has it produced for us? The promise was that it would promote competition, reduce prices, increase choice for the consumer and business and, most importantly, increase efficiency of energy generation and distribution in Ireland. Unfortunately, the result has been few new entrants into the market and those who have come in have had to be invited, little choice for the consumer and business, although there is some, a significant increase in the cost of energy and inefficiency problems within ESB plants in the generation of energy. Perhaps we need to reassess what the Government can do to take a more proactive approach towards promoting competition within the energy sector. Competition has not yet worked because the bottom line is that the customer has not yet got the rewards.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">On the question of supporting economic growth, another of the Minister's first core policy objectives, perhaps the most significant concern of IBEC, ISME and others, certainly as outlined to me, is the increase in the cost of energy. The reality is that we must take a more aggressive approach towards facilitating competition which, ultimately, will be the way to reduce costs. Some outside factors affect the cost of energy, such as the cost of oil, but there are others ways to ensure efficiency and a reduction in costs to the consumer. Every time the ESB applies to the regulator for a price increase we are told it is the last big increase customers will see, but six or eight months later another big increase is sought. When will this stop? Small and large businesses and households cannot continue to have increased energy costs as witnessed during the past 18 months to two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">There is still huge market dominance within the energy sector from the ESB and that is understandable. The transition towards a liberalised market will take some time. People may ask the valid question whether by facilitating a significant increase in the borrowing capacity of the ESB we are just feeding the potential for an increase in the dominance of the ESB within the marketplace? Now it can increase its capital investment significantly because it can borrow much more money in Ireland and abroad. Will the ESB become a more powerful and more dominant player within the Irish energy market? That is not a reason to support the Bill, but I support it as does the Fine Gael Party. If the borrowing capacity of the ESB is being increased significantly, are other measures being taken to ensure the problem of market dominance is addressed in the ESB within the energy market? Perhaps the Minister will comment on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Another area about which I am concerned relates to efficiency, the final area of the first core policy objectives of the Minister. I raised this matter previously on Question Time. The efficiency of many of the older ESB plants is a problem. Perhaps this makes the argument for the need for the ESB to be allowed borrow more money to invest in its plant. Certainly, during the past three to five years the efficiency of ESB plants, using the standard measures, whether to look at the down time of plant or whatever, in regard to energy generation has been a problem and the graph is going in the wrong direction. The Minister, as the largest shareholder in this State company, needs to apply pressure to ensure that figure is watched carefully. We must ensure the ESB generates electricity in as efficient a manner as possible, even if it has dominance in the area of generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Turning to the second core objective, ensuring security of supply, I welcome the Minister's announcement some months ago concerning the promotion of the idea of a new east-west interconnector between Wicklow and Wales. However, I have a concern. There are two 500 watt interconnectors which have the potential to provide up to 1,000 MW of electricity coming into Ireland, should it be needed for security reasons. The project makes much sense for other reasons but primarily for security reasons. I have a concern about a private investor and operator owning and running that infrastructure. When discussing the possibility of the ESB being privatised, the Minister stated clearly that he was opposed to the privatisation of the transmission and distribution systems. He said he believed that infrastructure, such as wires and pipes, are critical national assets and should remain in State ownership. What he is saying, and I agree with him, is that we should never sell the national electricity grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Surely an interconnector is only an extension of the national grid linking Ireland's grid to the British grid. That is a slight over-simplification of what the interconnector is but, in essence, that is what it is. Does it not make sense for that to be a piece of State infrastructure in the electricity market rather than allowing a private operator to own, run and control that interconnector into the future? I continue to make the case that State investment in and State management of that interconnector would be a good investment and would be a good value-for-money spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Continuing on the theme of security of supply, I wish to deal with the need for a proper fuel mix in the production of energy in Ireland. The Minister mentioned coal and the Moneypoint plant. My views have not changed on this. We need to keep coal in the energy mix in Ireland even though it is a dirty fuel. If Moneypoint was changed over to a gas-powered station it would not make sense in terms of security of supply. We could be overly vulnerable to the international price of gas, which may be a real problem when gas supplies run out in Europe and we may be reliant on Russia for the supply of gas. Even though I prefer that coal would not be a fuel source for large energy generation because it is dirty, it is a necessary part of the mix for the medium-term at least. As the Minister said, we need to make the necessary investment to upgrade the facility at Moneypoint to minimise the emissions from that plant and to benchmark that upgrade to ensure that the emissions from coal power generation will be minimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Gas is a very efficient and clean source of power and the sooner we bring gas ashore on the west coast, the better. The new peat power stations are a big improvement on the former stations, but I am concerned by the thought process that commissioned the building of two new peat power stations, when in the not too distant future we will seek to replace peat as an energy source, because it is a finite resource and there are much cleaner ways of producing power than burning peat. Obviously a change cannot happen overnight, because a great many jobs are dependent on the peat industry. We need to discuss how peat as an energy source would be replaced over a phased period.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_434">The Minister may check it. I think it is healthy to put my thought out for discussion. We should consider over a phased period replacing peat with biomass, which is far more efficient in terms of CO2 emissions. Wood biomass is neutral in terms of carbon emissions. While it offers huge potential as a crop that can be grown on both set-aside and bogland, I take a cautious approach towards it because of the transition period that is required in phasing it in and the discussions that will be required with Bord na Móna.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The final element of the energy mix is the renewables, that is wind, wave, tidal and a whole set of other clean fuel sources. I believe Ireland is dragging its heels, as the rest of Europe, particularly northern Europe, moves ahead with ambitious targets. We have been warned in the media a number of times that we may have capacity problems in not being able to provide enough power for the economy. The interconnector is a potential answer, but the bottom line is that we need to attract other interested parties, as well as the ESB, to generate electricity in Ireland and to compete with it. Viridian and Eirtricity are such companies but we need more competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The final core objective of the Minister is to ensure that energy supply and use are environmentally sustainable. This comes back to the last point, which is the lack of initiative in Ireland on renewable sources of energy. As I have said a dozen times, we have a number of natural competitive advantages, but there still seems to be no ambition in Government in this area. Only the AER schemes have been of any consequence, and up until AER VI, they have been by and large a failure on the promotion of wind energy. Under AER VI, we will probably have a significant build in wind energy projects across the county, which is welcome. We should be much more proactive in bio-fuel technology, replacing diesel with biodiesel for example, again providing a new crop that can be grown on setaside land and replacing petrol with ethanol, providing new and exciting possibility for land use as well as much cleaner fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">We are not breaking new ground. The technology already exists. Whether one looks west to the United States or east to Germany or France, the industries already exist. We have only to copy what they are doing, but we do not seem to have the ambition to do that. In last year's budget, there were minor tax breaks for a small number of pilot projects in bio-fuel and biomass, in spite of the fact that wood biomass plantations would grow more efficiently in Ireland than in any other EU country and that we have more consistent and stronger wind speed than any other EU country and very suitable tidal conditions for power generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Bill has provided a useful opportunity to make some general comments on the energy market. What is being proposed, on balance, is worth supporting. The ESB is a good company that has served Ireland well and has provided a consistent supply of energy which is fundamental to the marketplace. The ESB has requested to increase its borrowing capacity and what is being proposed is not unreasonable. I am happy to support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_439">On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill. The Minister has explained in detail the background to the Bill and the necessity for its speedy passage through the Oireachtas. I know that all Stages were taken in the Seanad during one afternoon. Given the liquidity of the ESB, it is imperative that the Bill is passed as soon as possible so that the ESB can increase its borrowing to €6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The ESB has made a massive capital investment. A few months ago I, together with my Dublin city north side and west side colleagues, were briefed on the expansion of the network on the north side and west side of Dublin. In my constituency an additional 15,000 to 20,000 homes and several thousand businesses will be built in the next five to ten years, necessitating a massive expansion of the network. We welcomed the briefing on how the additional moneys being generated by the ESB, through its core business activity and its loan facility, is being invested in the Dublin network. The chairman, Tadhg O'Donoghue, pointed out recently that there has been a quantum leap in electricity demand of approximately 41% in the past ten years, the era of the Celtic tiger, and there is a projected consistent rise in electricity demand over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The Minister has explained why it was necessary to recast section 4 of the 1954 Act in detail. It is interesting in that context that a few months ago he seemed to react with consternation at a successful public placement by the ESB on the New York market. Several Sunday newspapers, including <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, reported that he was livid and hopping mad when the ESB secured additional liquidity in the region of €850 million by this placement.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Both the chief executive and the chairman explained in detail at the time the efficient manner in which the ESB, as a national semi-State company, could secure additional resources and pointed out the various parameters of the management of the company's financial resources and its successful construction of the electricity network which has been the backbone of our economy for 80 years. It was necessary to minimise the cost of debt through the company's strong relationship with several banks, especially the European Investment Bank to which the Minister referred, and the company was able to take advantage of several maturities and competitive interest rates on markets such as New York with banks such as ABN AMRO and Barclays Capital. There was a reasonably consistent and prudent approach to the additional financing of the company in that placement last December. If true, the Minister's consternation was misplaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">There are powerful forces in our society which would like us to travel the Eircom route with the ESB and electricity generation and distribution, which my party believes would be a disastrous mistake to be avoided at all costs. I am therefore glad to hear the Minister reiterate the statements he made on the key assets of the ESB at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and that he has no intention of privatising them.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I omitted to congratulate my colleague Deputy Coveney on his recent magnificent election to the European Parliament. As a result of his achievement and that of Proinsias De Rossa in my party, and of all our colleagues in the local elections we may have a new Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the autumn who might have a different point of view and we ought to reflect on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The Labour Party firmly believes the ESB is a key national distribution network and its key assets should remain in public ownership. We should avoid a disastrous outcome such as we saw with regard to broadband and which we have discussed many times with this Minister over the past two years. We must learn from the telecommunications experience. The Minister has clearly outlined the financial background to the Bill and to the extension of the borrowing limits and other credits available to the ESB. I warmly welcome the projected €4 billion of capital expenditure on investment over the coming years, and the €650 million which was spent last year on 7,000 kilometres of distribution network. I add my congratulations to those of the Minister to the ESB and its 8,300 staff on their achievements over the past 80 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Like other Deputies I am an avid reader of <i>Electric Mail</i> and follow as closely as possible the key developments which the company has pursued in recent times. It has taken many innovative steps such as the commitment to the all-Ireland market about which the chief executive Pádraig McManus spoke in the context of the deal with Northern Ireland Electricity, the Ballylongford station, and the long-standing achievements of ESBI in the English market since 1992 where it recently purchased a major power station at Southampton with the capacity to generate 800 MW of electricity. Its support for the all-Ireland market and recently for the two islands interconnector indicates that the ESB is prepared to deal with the competitive market which will develop in these islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">We have often raised issues concerning wind power, especially the disappointing failure to advance its role in our electricity generation mix and some of the problems which have arisen in County Mayo and elsewhere. One of the fundamental problems is that the market in the Republic is very small, approximately the same size as Kent in England. There were problems with the expected expansion of renewable energy and the 2010 target. It is to be welcomed that we can look to a larger energy market for the future. Denmark, which has a splendid track record in the use of wind power and produces the equivalent of 60% of the total Irish electricity generation output, is part of a much wider, larger and greater electricity grid than ours. It is to be hoped that this development and the recent decisions on the grid code will allow wind power to take up the role which it merits in the future development in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">On this Bill, I asked the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago why the House did not have a Green Paper on electricity generation and the energy market two years ago to which all parties could have made an input. There could have been a process by which the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would have been involved with the Department in bringing forward some of the most advanced ideas for the development of our electricity market. Instead we are bringing forward this Bill, which I support, to extend the borrowing capacity of the ESB but we are unsure of the future shape and structures of the electricity market. The Minister occasionally comments on how he foresees the market but does not give us any considered views, as he did in his opposition to privatisation of the national grid, perhaps under pressure from the Labour Party and other parties in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">A few months ago, Deputy Eamon Ryan and I tried to table parliamentary questions in respect of the grid code for wind but the Ceann Comhairle rejected them on the basis that it was a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and Mr. Tom Reeves, who is responsible for deciding these issues, which are vital for the future of our country and our economy. It is completely inappropriate that Members cannot discuss any aspect of the future evolution of the electricity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I deeply regret that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has not seen fit to provide a frank exposition of the likely evolution of the market, as he sees it, and how the structure will develop. There are many areas he has not addressed in that regard which, therefore, makes matters problematic in terms of the future development of energy markets here.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">There are far more pressing issues relating to electricity generation and supply than those dealt with in the Bill. Some people might inquire whether there should be a statutory limit on borrowing or whether the level of such borrowing should be left to the commercial discretion of the members of the board, particularly in light of the ESB's achievements in our economy in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">There are many fundamental issues which have not been addressed. The cost of electricity in Ireland has risen rapidly in recent years. The trend is much more pronounced here than in other EU member states. As a result, Ireland has moved from being about the EU average in terms of electricity prices to having the second highest priced electricity in the Union. Apparently, Italy is the most expensive country in this regard. There has been a series of price hikes, amounting to 29% in total, in the past couple of years. These hikes were approved by the CER. As regards the price increase which is in the offing, all the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will state is that the ESB will have to find more efficiencies within its structures to bear the additional cost of oil and deal with some of the other issues that have arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The position for commercial and industrial users is particularly acute. Spokespersons on energy in this House have been made aware of widespread criticism of the increase in prices. Organisations such as the Small Firms Association and ISME have constantly pointed to this as a key reason behind the need for a much more efficient energy market. Electricity is important to Irish industry, particularly in terms of our history as a location for computing and data centres, chip manufacturing, etc. I welcome the Minister's recent statement that national competitiveness will have to be a key element considered by Mr. Tom Reeves. Energy inputs have a key role in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Householders would have expected that with liberalisation of the market and deregulation in recent years, they would receive far lower rather than far higher electricity bills. There appears to be an incredible inconsistency as regards the development of so-called competition in this country. The problem of high prices has been exacerbated by a recent Government decision. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who, we have heard, is in his last few months as Minister for Finance and who a massive majority of Fianna Fáil voters believe should be moved sideways as soon as possible, saw the ESB as an easy target from which to grab huge dividends of almost €40 million and €70 million last year. This fact provides some of the background to the Bill because it meant that the ESB had to seek higher prices and a higher borrowing limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The generation of electricity and the necessity to have the most efficient system relating thereto should be more important than a Progressive Democrats-inclined Minister for Finance who is simply anxious to balance books no matter what happens, even to the poorest households in this country. The latter often try desperately to pay electricity bills with the help of MABS, organisations such as the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul and community welfare officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The Minister has a key responsibility, before he leaves the Department, to spell out what has gone wrong with the introduction of a so-called electricity market. He cannot say that the model the Government has adopted has worked. That model has resulted in severe price inflation and problems in respect of the maintenance of the capital equipment of the electricity grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">These are important issues and we could have expected that they would have been addressed in this debate. As before, however, on the brief occasions during Question Time, etc., when we have had an opportunity to discuss the electricity market and developments in electricity generation, the Minister has refused to provide a broad idea of how he intends matters to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">We believe that the role of the ESB in terms of the national grid is critical. Like other Deputies and spokespersons, I spoke to representatives of the company in recent times in terms of its role in maintaining public control of the key national electricity infrastructure. We must ask whether the statutory instrument of 2000 which established the national grid has been adhered to. I do not support the director of the Competition Authority who, like many others, wants to break the ESB up into a series of different companies. My reasons for this were outlined in my earlier comments regarding the telecommunications break-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I commend the 8,300 staff of the ESB who have dealt with some of the difficult issues to which I refer with determination and confidence during the past four to five years. They currently own just 5% of the company. To defend the interests of those workers, trade union leaders put forward far-reaching demands in recent times. It is normal and necessary that trade unionists should protect the workers they represent. However, the interests of our nation require that this company should not be privatised and should not take the route followed in respect of Eircom. I commend the staff on their tremendous confidence. The role of this semi-State company in the history of this country cannot be over-emphasised. Throughout the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, when many parts of Ireland did not have electricity, this valiant and determined company created a basic infrastructure. It has kept pace, in good times, with the economy, though only just barely in recent years. The programme of action for competitiveness and transparency, PACT, agreement is extremely important in that regard. I wish the management and staff of the ESB well in the future as developments occur relating to some of the issues to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">There were many other matters with which the Minister, who, unfortunately, is not present in the Chamber, might have dealt. I refer to my question about the preferred or successful bidders — Aughinish Alumina and Tynagh Energy — for two recently announced generating stations and the reports received about these companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Many people see the recent price rises as the core problem in the energy market. Households have suffered most in that regard, as is evident from successive significant increases in recent ESB bills. Meters were not adjusted to reflect the increases in 20,000 low-income households and, as recently as a few days ago, it appeared these householders would be responsible for the shortfall. The community and public service role of the ESB is significant and must remain so. The closure of 27 ESB shops also impacted on low-income families in terms of securing electrical products at competitive prices and interest-free credit. Unfortunately, the Minister has not addressed these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Security of supply is of the utmost importance. A number of imported stand-by generators had to be used by the ESB in successive winters to keep pace with the needs of our developing economy. Much of the difficulty in this regard has arisen from the convoluted and unsuccessful way in which liberalisation and deregulation has been implemented. The precarious nature of the electricity supply gives rise to concern. I welcome the east-west interconnector and the all-Ireland market which I hope can give us the necessary security in future. We must at all costs avoid the disastrous events in North America which began in Ontario and southern Canada and spread into the north-west United States, and the similar events in Italy and Austria where one system knocked out other systems. That should never be permitted to happen here. That is a key responsibility of the Minister, the ESB, the national grid and the distribution company, and I would have welcomed some comment from him in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">A major contributing factor to the problem is that plant was allowed to decline. The significant investment being undertaken will increase the capacity of generators from 77% up to the required level of 95%. This area needs to be urgently addressed. I welcome the security of supply which the Bill will provide to the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">A lengthy debate has taken place on wind power. Environmental and ecological disasters have occurred at Derrybrien and other locations. There have also been problems regarding the grid code and security of supply from wind. The Minister has considerable responsibility after AER VI to try to ensure we move to a position where instead of being bottom or close to bottom of the league for electricity generation from wind and other renewable energy, Ireland will see an improvement in its position. The Minister has a significant responsibility in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The Minister has had little to say on other renewable energy such as solar heating, biomass or any other energy sources that might be available to us. I accept that a White Paper was produced a few years ago, but in recent times we have not had any dramatic policy announcements. When one looks back at the Minister's announcements in his first year in office, it is regrettable we have achieved so little in the intervening period.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">With those caveats, I welcome the Bill which is necessary to provide for the infrastructural needs of the ESB. I urge the Minister, especially in advance of the major electricity Bill he is always promising us, to share with us his thoughts and those of the Department regarding the future structures of the electricity market. I welcome that, like us, he appears to have learned the lesson of what happened in the telecommunications area and is trying to ensure we do not go down the same disastrous road. Having said that, the Labour Party warmly welcomes the Bill.</p>

It is not unfortunate; it is typical he is not here to listen to what we have to say. It may be a small matter for discussion whether we should issue €4 billion to a specific company. It may not be of much concern to the Minister to know the opinion of Opposition spokespersons who work on a committee dealing specifically with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">It is another example of the arrogance that characterises the Government. A Minister asked yesterday for an example of the Government's arrogance. This is an example of arrogance towards this House, the Opposition parties and the people. Perhaps I would not feel so strongly about this if it were not typical of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the past year. There is not a single occasion on which he has attended a Second Stage debate to hear what Opposition spokespersons have to say. In some cases we could have spent a year or two devising policies and opinions. We have something to say, yet the Minister never stays to hear what it is.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_473">I find it remarkable. I do not know what he does. Perhaps he will read this speech at some stage or somebody will raise the matter with him. I am glad at least the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Browne, is present, as my Labour Party colleague had the Minister of State with responsibility for looking after Donegal who would have had no interest in what we have to say. It is disgraceful and is worth commenting upon. I would be interested in hearing an explanation from the Minister for his non-attendance during the contributions of spokespersons from the Labour Party and the Technical Group when he concludes the Second Stage debate. I am tired of speaking in the Chamber when the preparatory work I have put into my speech and in shadowing the Minister to provide a balance and offer different ideas is disregarded by the Government. I hope that will change sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I disagree with my Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues because I do not agree with the Bill. I have serious concerns about what we are doing in passing it and in what we are doing in regard to the development of the ESB. The Bill should be concerned with our plans and strategic vision for the ESB and how we want to see the company develop. I do not know the Minister's plans because he has not set out any, but I would extrapolate that it is his intention to let the company be. He is providing it with an extra €4 billion to invest as it sees fit and allow the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to continue on the basis of the <i>status quo</i>. The <i>status quo</i> is not where we should be; we should not be happy with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">In a recent committee meeting the Minister acknowledged that the desired split of the ESB, between the transmission network company, which I believe was meant to be called Eirgrid, and the rest of the company, has not taken place. He said humbly that he could not do anything about it because of some industrial relations difficulties surrounding the issue. I am not sure what those difficulties are. It is remarkable that a Government that can relocate the civil servants of the State throughout the country on the apparent whim of the Minister for Finance cannot divide out two separate and distinct wings of the ESB. This has significant implications for the development of the electricity market in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The situation is an example of the <i>status quo</i> being left in place. I am told that the difficulties concern industrial relations and the pay and conditions that would go with the separation into two companies. It is understandable that employees would have concerns. However, there is a wider issue with regard to working conditions in the company. Workers in the rest of the economy must look at ESB conditions and only wish they could get a job in the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The Minister described the recent deal with regard to Moneypoint as a positive development. It is for the workers involved. Basic pay rates at Moneypoint appear to me a multiple of what is typical for other industries, similar craft work or similar industrial enterprises. I do not object to the deal. I understand the workers negotiated for the best position and they are getting that. However, I must ask whether the Government is right in allowing the ESB have this special status, as it appears to me, within the overall industry and overall working and labour conditions in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">It seems there is special treatment of ESB workers and of executives within the ESB. I question whether that <i>status quo</i> is equitable. Is it correct for a State company to treat one group of workers so favourably in comparison with so many others who work for the minimum wage or for salaries that do not even add up to the overtime bonus or severance packages granted to certain workers within the ESB? While this question may not go down well in union circles, it is an issue the Minister should address. I urge him to respond and explain the reason for this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The <i>status quo</i> in the country is also seen in the breaking up, deregulation and part liberalisation of the electricity market. As a consequence, we have seen significant price increases amounting to 23% in the past two years. We have gone from a situation where we were below the European average in terms of electricity prices, to being significantly above them, especially in the area of industrial use which has economic consequences. There is no doubt that the liberalisation model that has been adopted has caused that significant price increase. To attract the new capacity we need, the new marginal cost had to be one that would attract a new private investor and it is therefore much higher. The operators in the industry gain in profits from that new higher marginal cost and, not surprisingly, last year the ESB made after-tax profits of €249 million. The dividend to the State was €67 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I wonder whether it is the Minister of Finance who is directing this <i>status quo</i> policy. He may see this dividend as a convenient stealth tax. Effectively it is a tax on one section of society which goes into the Government coffers. This is possibly the explanation for the <i>status quo</i> or the “let it be” attitude to the ESB strategy the Government is following.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Government is also letting matters be with regard to our environmental performance. One of the most remarkable comments I have heard in my two years in this House is the comment from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that we were victims of our own success in the development of renewable energy. We were setting the world alight with 200 MW of wind power. Could that be believed when we only thought we would get 20 MW a year? Every other country in Europe increases its capacity by thousands of megawatts of wind power each year with only half the wind we have. The Minister's comment was an incredible example of his arrogance and inability to listen. His inability to come in to this Chamber and hear what other people say is so complete that he sees our miserable performance in the development of renewable energy as a sign of success. It was a remarkable statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I agree with Deputy Coveney with regard to our abject failure in the development of biomass and bio-energy products. This is another example of where the <i>status quo</i> is unacceptable. In a country with a fantastic climate for such products and where farmers are running out of markets where they can get decent prices for their new crops, we should be leading the world. However, yet again, we are last. We have small experimental projects on farms here and there when we should, like other countries, be leading the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">One final issue in terms of the <i>status quo</i> concerns supply and generation policy and three or four characteristics relating to it. The most remarkable characteristic is the incredibly poor performance of the ESB’s existing plants which operate at something like 76% capacity. This is, by international standards, a mortification. The ESB is excellent at going round the world advising developing and other countries on how to run their generation systems. If the Vietnamese power company, which is receiving advice from the ESB, or any other power company ran at a capacity level of 76%, the ESB engineers, who are bright and excellent, would point out that it was a disgraceful performance. However, we cannot get more than a 76% supply from our plant, which has huge implications for the price we pay for our electricity. The real problem is providing for the peak hours. In circumstances where only 76% of our plant is working at any one time, we are paying very expensively for our peak power supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">We are also having great difficulty getting a new supply into the country and have only had one major new plant in recent years. When the regulator came before our committee, he said that if we have further difficulties in that regard, he will commission the ESB to build a new plant. In other words, we will be returning to a day when a centralised State control of the operations is in place. Perhaps that is the way to go. However, I would like to know whether that is the policy. It is because the Minister is not present or because he does not discuss the issue or listen to us that we do not know the policy for the running of the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">This Bill legislates to allow the company spend €4 billion of borrowed money. It will be able to borrow the money at a much cheaper rate than its competitors because of the arrangements we set up, which is perhaps fair and right. We should also ask how this money will be spent. I get no sense that the Government will have a real say in the company as to where and how the money is spent or that it will give direction or look for measures of performance on how it is spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The company must make a significant investment in the grid and I welcome that. I would like to see that investment structured in a manner where we provide grid capacity to areas from which we will get future supply. In this country, those areas are the west, the north-west and the south-west, which have significant wind resources and an amazing wealth of untapped energy. We should spend our €2 billion investment in the grid building lines to that power source to ensure we can develop it. We can grow wealthy and increase employment from that position. However, we are not doing that but providing where the demand is.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">There is no clear direction from this Government as to how we should structure this investment or how we should monitor the management of the expenditure of the money. We have quite happily for the past 20 or 30 years stepped back and allowed the ESB run our electricity generation system. That was a successful policy. The ESB was run by bright and talented people, mainly from Kerry, over those years. We stood back and allowed them run it. As long as they could provide electricity cheaply, that was a successful strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">In a European context, however, when markets are being liberalised and we are meant to open our market and have half done so, that is not necessarily the cleverest strategy. It is certainly not a strategy to which we should just hand over €4 billion without setting out a policy commitment as to how we want it spent. It is that lack of policy and that incredible failure by the ESB over the past 20 years to invest in renewable alternatives and to start becoming a world leader in tidal power, biomass, wind and other products that one must criticise. I am reluctant to give the same people another €4 billion given their dismal failure record in investment in areas in which I want them to invest.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I can be critical of the company but I am primarily critical of the Government which did not give direction to the company. It was happy as long as the lights were on and the price was reasonably cheap. It did not have any real thought for the future. That attitude is no longer good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I want to see significant investment in the area of energy saving. Intelligent circuitry could be in every house and small business. This would allow people to switch off their machines, such as their fridges, during the peak hours around 6.30 p.m. when everyone comes home and turns on all their devices. It would allow a household to decide intelligently that the peak hour electricity is very expensive and is when the most clapped-out ESB plant — Tarbert — is turned on to provide for it. This is very expensive electricity because that plant is only running for that particular period. We should invest in the cleverest of electronics which allows householders to avoid that high cost by turning off their machines and using them instead at 2.30 a.m., in the afternoon or in the valley periods. This would be a start to levelling out our demand for electricity and would be the smartest investment at present. However, I do not hear the Minister or anyone else from his Department pushing that as a clever investment strategy. The €4 billion invested in that direction would make a significant difference to the environment, economy and electricity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I wish to make three final points with regard to the structure of the system. It seems to me the proposed new market structure, the localised, marginalised pricing system, if that is the correct acronym, will not work and will not be introduced. I have spoken to a number of people in different quarters and it seems the complexity, difficulty and substantial cost involved in the introduction of such a system means it will not happen. I do not get any sense of direction from the Minister as to that fact. He does not wish to comment. He has a fantastic system in his ministry. Not only does he not appear in the House, he has the system of regulators which look after the different departments while he stands back and says it is nothing to do with him. From what people in the industry say, I believe the new proposed system will not work and a different one will be required. I would like to hear a direction from the Minister as to what system he thinks will be viable and how we should proceed in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">This may be controversial and may be where I would disagree with my colleagues, Deputies Broughan and Finian McGrath, I think we must examine the structure of the ESB. I do not think the <i>status quo</i> is the correct way to go. There are three possible choices which we can make. There could be a return to the centralised control system which, in an electricity market the size of Ireland, is regarded by many people as the most intelligent and the one that works best. Over the 20 years when we left it to the clever Kerry people to run our electricity system, they did a good job. I do not think the European Union will agree to that proposal and that will rule it out as an option, even though it might be the most intelligent option. I would like to hear the Minister’s view on whether we should be doing that. In those circumstances it is fair for us to hand out €4 billion because competition would not be affected and other companies would be disadvantaged in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">A possible alternative to bring in competition is to split up the ESB generating companies into three or four smaller companies, but not the network, which should never be touched, nor the supply company. I favour a third option which I will develop on Committee Stage with the Minister if he is available. A system of management contracts being issued for the generation stations could be considered. A management contract could be offered for one or other of the stations. The contractor could bid into the market and be allowed to innovate, expand and mainly operate the company as efficiently as possible. Our generation rate could then possibly rise above the present 76%. I will return to tease out this option on Committee Stage which I hope happens and which I hope the Minister attends.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">We have a political problem regarding our electricity market and a serious problem for consumers because the price is rocketing. We have a bad problem with emissions because large amounts of CO2 are being produced. The Minister has made a conscious decision. While he has done something on broadband and is flush with success in fisheries, I think he plans to do nothing in the area of energy. He has decided the Taoiseach is sensitive to any unpopular decisions and does not wish the Government to be seen to be doing too much. It is a case of batten down the hatches. It may be a dysfunctional <i>status quo </i>but it is not worth taking the political risk to do anything about it. That is my reading of the Government’s energy policy, even though energy policy is one of the most important areas. The Minister needs to change that. I apologise to my colleague for being late.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_495">I thank the House for the opportunity to speak in this debate. Before I deal with the details of the Bill, it is important to recognise the important and valuable work of the ESB. It has a proud record of service and a history built on compassion and service to the people. Long may that continue. It is essential that this national resource is protected, nurtured and developed in a way that suits our citizens and its customers. This national gem must be supported in a practical way and that is the reason I support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">In the past our people did not have electrical power in their homes and many died in poverty and from the cold. That reality should not be forgotten. The ESB played a significant role in saving lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The purpose of this Bill is to raise the ESB's statutory borrowing limit. It will facilitate the major infrastructure investment programme being undertaken by the ESB. This includes significant investment in renewing and upgrading the electricity network. The statutory borrowing limit stands at €2.03 billion and has remained unchanged for the past 22 years. The new Bill proposes raising this limit to €6 billion to take account of the reality of today's economy. I welcome this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Management of the finances of the ESB is a matter for the board and management of the company. The board has discharged its fiduciary duty prudently down through the years, with some minor exceptions. Towards the end of last year, the ESB became more acutely aware of the constraint which the existing borrowing limit exerted on the company. It became apparent that for the company to accomplish its significant capital expenditure programme, it would need to rely more extensively on its borrowing capacity and that it could not continue business as usual within the confines of the existing limit. The ESB's borrowing level is now very close to the existing limit. The urgent passing of this legislation is therefore absolutely essential for the company to continue to operate effectively. That is the reason I support this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">While dealing with the ESB and the wider issue of public services in general, the lesson from recent elections is that people are demanding quality services and saying "no" to the quick buck brigade who seem to be obsessed with their privatisation agenda. This obsession is reflected in the Government and particularly in the Cabinet. They must be stopped in their tracks. As legislators, we must be the watchdogs for organisations such as the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Its record speaks for itself. The ESB was founded in 1927 as a statutory corporation in the Twenty-six Counties. It is 95%-owned by the Government with the remaining shares held by the employees' share option trust. The ESB is a vertically integrated utility and includes a number of divisions which are ring-fenced and operate independently in the electricity market. The ESB group employs approximately 8,500 people. It is the leading Irish company in the energy utility sector. I welcome these progressive facts about the ESB. It is a significant resource employing 8,500 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The ESB power generation operates 19 major power stations, covering hydro-electric generation and stations powered by coal, oil, gas and peat. A subsidiary company, Hibernian Wind Power, owns and operates wind farms. I wish to put on the record my concern about some of the operations of Hibernian Wind Power which have caused serious damage to the environment, especially in parts of Galway and other parts of the country. We must wake up to the reality that any involvement in these projects must be properly researched and examined. The geology of an area must be studied in a professional manner. That is my one major criticism regarding these issues. We cannot have landslides destroying little villages, towns and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The ESB is a major supplier of power to domestic and business customers. The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, oversees charges made by the public electricity supplier to customers. ESB Networks is the owner of the high voltage transmission system and the owner and operator of the medium and lower voltage distribution system. It provides services to all 1.7 million electricity customers and all generators and suppliers of electricity in the Twenty-six Counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">With the opening to competition of the electricity market, it is essential that ESB Networks, which will remain a monopoly business in the new market, provides service on a transparent and equal basis to all electricity customers, irrespective of which electricity supplier they use. This requirement is clearly set out in the legislation establishing new electricity market structures and is incorporated into the licence issued to the ESB by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">It is important in the context of a debate on the ESB and power to put on record our opposition to nuclear power and any attempt by energy companies to introduce nuclear power to this country. When such attempts were made in the past, the people reacted positively by rejecting nuclear power.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">As regards market opening, 56% of the electricity market had been opened to competition by February 2004 and the market will be fully open to competition in 2005. The ESB has facilitated this process. It is important to recognise, for example, that the company has made virtual independent power available at discount prices to the independent supply sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Ireland has one of the fastest growing electricity markets in the developed world. Record growth of more than 40% was recorded in the past ten years. This is far ahead of growth in the rest of Europe and a massive vote of confidence in the staff of the ESB. It shows the company's great potential for development and wealth creation. It is up to us to ensure we listen to the message of the recent elections and distribute wealth fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The sheer number of staff in the ESB — 8,000 — indicates the potential for development. We have come a long way in creating Ireland's premier electricity utility. I state this confidently but with positive criticism. History shows that in the 19th century, the electrical revolution sweeping the rest of the developed world seemed set to bypass Ireland. Only a few selected locations had this incredible new power source on tap. Thanks to the determination of a handful of far-sighted people, however, electricity was soon to take its first steps towards becoming the indispensable power source it has proved to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The pioneers of electricity supply in Ireland are remembered in a stone which commemorates the building of a power station at the Pigeon House for the Dublin Corporation electricity department in 1903. The original building, modernised and re-equipped, still stands. It is a very small but historical part of the electricity generation and supply system of the Electricity Supply Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">As long ago as 1915, a civil engineer, Theodore Stevens, investigated the possibility of generating electricity from the River Shannon on behalf of the Irish hydro-electric syndicate. This project, like an earlier one in 1901, was not developed and, in 1918, our water powered resources were discussed again without action being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">When the State was founded in 1922, it was clear that to progress industrially, it would have to develop and use its natural resources. An Irish engineer, Dr. Thomas A. McLoughlin, submitted proposals for damming the River Shannon and building an electric power station at Ardnacrusha, a few miles from Limerick, which would bring power to cities and towns. The concept was bold and radical and his initiative was rewarded when a German engineering company was authorised by the Government to prepare a detailed scheme to be submitted to a group of international experts. With minor modifications, the Shannon scheme was approved in a report published in the spring of 1925. This is the history and background of the ESB, one of which we should all be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">As regards the potential for the ESB in an all-Ireland market, it is essential that we tap further into the new economic situation, especially since the beginning of the peace process. There is significant potential to develop and expand the ESB. Radical and new policies show vision for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">To those who constantly attack the State sector and State companies, the ESB is an example of a profitable, vibrant company which pays decent salaries to its employees. We have a group of people who, backed by sponsors, want to take such companies apart to meet their greedy needs. Organisations such as the ESB must be nurtured, defended and protected. I also accept that they must modernise in a positive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I have addressed the issues of efficiency, modernisation and nuclear power. I want to hammer home that nuclear power is not welcome. There are radical, more creative ways to generate energy and provide services.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I welcome the opportunity to put my views on record. As a backbench Independent Deputy, I celebrate the election of two new Independent MEPs, Kathy Sinnott and Deputy Marian Harkin, whom I congratulate. The election of two Independent MEPs and approximately 90 Independent councillors has not received sufficient coverage. Those elected have been emerging in all communities and councils and have now emerged on the European stage. It is important that the views of Independent Deputies are reflected and I am delighted to express my views on energy in this debate. I wish the ESB well and support the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_515">I compliment the ESB on its work since it was founded three quarters of a century ago. It has met challenges as they arose and done tremendous work to provide electricity. While electricity was expensive at times, it is reasonably competitive at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">It is no harm to ponder the Ardnacrusha scheme for a moment. At the time, it was deemed to be a white elephant, isolated and surrounded by rabbits. Like Shannon Airport, it would be regarded as a monument to something of a negative nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The ESB has stood the test of time as a State and semi-State body, providing an essential service at a competitive price for industry. Deputies on the right and left have a tendency to come down on one side or the other as regards State and semi-State bodies. The former take the approach that the only way forward is privatisation, while the latter regard nationalisation as the only way forward. We should have a mix of both approaches. There is no reason they cannot co-exist for the benefit of the country, the economy and the industries in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">As we all know, competition is the lifeblood of trade. Sectors with effective competition, whether public or private, are inevitably competitive. They give out competitive vibes and go about their business in a competitive manner. When one looks back, one finds that the transport sector was difficult to deregulate. While some aspects of that deregulation process may not have been helpful, services are now available in areas in which it was previously impossible to get transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I agree with much of what has been said about the success to date of the ESB and its concept. The future holds new challenges in that we have a bigger market with deregulation likely throughout Europe. Deregulation may become part and parcel of our economic thinking. Ironically, regulation of the ESB tends to encourage prices upwards, which is most unusual. While I am aware of the reason this is done, it should also be recognised that those in the business of providing alternative energy must bear in mind the need to keep their costs down so that they can compete with the ESB. I have serious doubts about the theory that is becoming dominant whereby to attract more competitors into the market, the cost of electricity to both industrial and domestic consumers should be increased. This concept could become part and parcel of future thinking on energy provision. It is not good and it will not work. It could have the opposite effect in a few years, as it may not be as competitive and sharp edged as it would be if the regulator insisted prices were kept down rather than being allowed to creep upwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I appreciate a semi-State body such as the ESB must have adequate resources to finance future projects at home and abroad. It has been innovative at finding ways and means to do so. The schemes referred to by the Minister have been before us for appraisal. Two elements of electricity supply are important. Prices must be kept down in so far as is possible because electricity is a basic energy source required by both industry and domestic consumers. If one lost sight of that, one would lose sight of the market to which the product is supplied. The knock-on effect of increased electricity prices would be colossal and stretches beyond electricity generation. Electricity is a basic ingredient for industry and, if it is competitively priced, industry has an advantage, but if it is not, industry is placed at a disadvantage. That can have further knock-on effects, which would not benefit industry, the competitiveness of the economy and the long-term prospects for the provision of such energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Wind energy is referred to regularly as an alternative energy source. While I agree with the concept, I am a little uneasy about it. The masts are not environmentally friendly in terms of their impact on the horizon. I am reminded of Don Quixote, the poor unfortunate guy who got entangled in windmills. There are many around nowadays who are like Don Quixote. I wonder if Cervantes had anticipated the effect of giant windmills on parts of the west, whether he might have elaborated more on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">We all recognise alternative energy sources must be found and must be as environmentally friendly as possible. Wind energy is more expensive to produce but it is more environmentally friendly, excepting the visual impact of wind farms. I would not like a scenario where every hilltop would be festooned with masts revolving frantically, given the amount of wind and hot air generated in the State. The first wind generating masts were built in Idaho and there was a difficulty with the amount of wind available there. I assure the Minister of State there would be no such difficulty in Ireland. If wind was not readily available, it would be produced locally. We recognise and support the need for alternative energy sources but there is not much sense in adopting them if they result in increased costs to industry which may be prohibitive in terms of competitiveness. The regulator has dual problems but he should bear competition in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I refer to wave energy, to which we can look forward. We have been told for the past ten years that the technology has not been sufficiently advanced to even consider its introduction. It has not advanced because alternative energy sources are available and there is no great urgency to proceed with wave energy production. When progress is made on wave energy, it will be much more accessible, efficient and effective than a number of alternative energy sources under consideration. Wave energy will prove to be more acceptable because of its visual impact on the landscape and it is likely to provide continuous power at a lower cost than had been anticipated because it will be based on the principle underpinning hydroelectric schemes, which have stood the test of time. Such energy would ensure electricity costs are kept in check so that industry can prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Minister referred to various alternative energy sources, including gas, which is important. The effectiveness of converting from one energy to another is determined by the efficiency of the conversion, whether it is from coal, gas, wind, wave or oil to electricity. Each much be examined in turn to assess the best way to make the conversion because, originally, gas conversion was not great in terms of efficiency but that has improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The legislation is a requirement. The ESB, of its own volition, must look to the future differently from the way it did in the past. New competition rules and deregulation have changed the landscape of energy provision and the ESB must examine how it can compete with its rivals. There should be less emphasis on ensuring its competitors are attracted into the workplace through increased electricity prices because of the serious detrimental knock-on effect that could have on industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">We have experienced a few energy crises in recent years. There were nationwide blackouts on a number of occasions and, in my innocence, I used to table parliamentary questions only to be informed it was no longer a matter for the Minister. However, everything is a matter for the Minister because he or she is responsible for the ESB and he or she must answer to the House in this regard. While the Minister must answer to the House, there is an increased shyness among some Ministers, although not the Minister of State who is present. Some of his colleagues are remarkably shy when it comes to asking simple questions about State and semi-State bodies for which they have responsibility. When power cuts take place intermittently, there is a need for action and the Minister should be prepared to answer to the House at all times because such cuts have widespread consequences. Knowing what has happened in parts of the UK and US, these events happen overnight at peak power times and it is not just a small area concerned which is affected. Often vast areas are affected with negative consequences for industrial and domestic consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I recognise the need for increased borrowing requirements. That must be dealt with on an ongoing basis and I hope the legislation will not encourage increases in electricity prices. Many consumers have recently received peculiar bills because of someone's failure to read the meters or for some other reason. I dealt recently with the case of an unfortunate person who received a bill for €400 when the bill is normally approximately €60 per month. That is due to a cost-saving exercise of one kind or another, although those exercises should not be necessary in the ESB at present given its solvency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_528">I am glad to address this proposal to allow the ESB to borrow more money. It is no wonder that organisation needs to borrow money because it is probably the most inefficient outfit we have ever seen, and I will give some examples of that. The Minister will let the ESB borrow money but when it is in difficulty, it contacts the regulator. The regulator and the ESB should both be sacked because he has let the company get away with murder. On three occasions last year he allowed ESB charges to be increased but, as Deputy Durkan said, when one asks the Minister a question in the Dáil, he says he has no power in this area because the regulator has the power. The regulator was appointed to regulate, but if his only job is to allow increases in the ESB's prices, then that is a problem for me, consumers and business. People complain about ESB charges. If that organisation borrows money and gets into more difficulties, that will come back to consumers and taxpayers, with the regulator bailing it out later.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I have some harsh things to say about the closure of Bellacorick power station but I will first inform the House why the ESB is inefficient, and the Minister of State should respond to this. It has been brought to my attention that the ESB bought a generator to use in Ireland and which it had in storage in Holland. It cost millions of euro but, once bought, the company found it did not suit the purpose for which it had been bought. Storage costs had to be paid for years and then the generator was sold at a loss to South Africa. An Irish person wanted to buy the generator to try to re-open Bellacorick. The minute the ESB heard that person was interested in Ireland, the generator was advertised for sale in European and world magazines and was sold, even though it had been in cold storage for two years, costing the taxpayers a fortune. The Minister of State should respond to that and if he wants more details, I will have them for him tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The Acting Chairman, Deputy Cowley, is a constituency colleague of mine. Many people working in Bellacorick will lose their jobs in the next year or so, but there was no need to close that power station. It could have been modernised and if the Minister had had the will and the commitment to the west, that would have happened. The ESB gave information to Bord na Móna about the amount of peat in the area which could have lasted another 20 to 40 years. The minute the ESB found out someone was interested in trying to set up a power station in the area, it sent its staff to destroy the bogs so nobody else could do anything with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It is amazing that when there was talk of closing Rhode, Shannonbridge, Lanesboro, Cahirciveen and Bellacorick, the two power stations to be modernised were in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge. Shannonbridge is in the constituency of the Tánaiste of Fianna Fáil, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. Why could not one of those stations have been opened and one station left open in the west? We have the peat, the people and the need for power, yet it did not happen. Were those political decisions?</p>
          <p eId="para_532">People refer to subsidies for the west but the Minister of State should address the massive subsidies for the power stations in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge. The EU and the Irish taxpayer are subsidising those but what was wrong with subsidising and modernising Bellacorick? We could have kept jobs in a disadvantaged area which had peat and which needs power. What was wrong with keeping that station open? The political will to do so did not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The taxpayers bailed out the ESB, just as they bailed out Telecom Éireann in the past. However, the latest from the ESB is that it will cost €10,000 to €15,000 to move one of its poles. It is time the Minister and his Department spelled out some home truths to the ESB. The taxpayers kept that company alive and bailed it out when it was losing millions of euro. Let us not crucify the man building a house in rural Ireland by charging him €12,000 to connect to the ESB. There is no competition in this market. That person cannot price someone else to connect to their power.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It is time the ESB was told to be realistic. It is the company's job to supply power to people in their homes. It is not the job of the people to pay for poles to connect rural houses to the electricity supply. Something must be done because people are getting angry. There are ESB and telecom poles in all corners of the country and someone will be killed by one. However, it will take a court case before the Department, the ESB and Eircom act. At the end of the day, the ESB is controlled by the taxpayer and the Minister of the day. It should not charge people the kind of money it does to remove these poles.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Acting Chairman will support me when I say that there is no need to close Bellacorick power station and that it should be modernised instead. There is no doubt that the staff are there and we need the power. We are told by every report that the west needs power, and we were warned last year that the increasing number of businesses and people means there will not be enough power. It is important in terms of jobs, power and to ensure those in the west have the same advantages as everyone else that Bellacorick power station is up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I want a guarantee from the Minister and the Department that if we allow the ESB to increase its borrowings to up to €650 million for network and infrastructure, it will not come back to the Minister or the taxpayer if it runs its business badly and finds itself in difficulty again.

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_537">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_538">That Dáil Éireann</p>

          <p eId="para_540">—noting conflicting statements by Ministers in recent weeks concerning the closure of Garda stations;</p>

          <p eId="para_543">—demands that the Government immediately publish this report and indicate how its commitment in the programme for Government to increase garda numbers will be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Dowd, McCormack and Ring.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I take the view that our Garda force is not a political pawn to be manipulated for the benefit of the political parties in Government. This applies whether the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is making empty promises about increasing garda numbers or whether he is avoiding straight answers on the closure or downgrading of Garda stations. Now the elections are over and the Government parties have got an appropriate response from the people, we need a post-11 June version from the Minister on plans for the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">An important report has been on the Minister's desk for the past six months. The information in this report was paid for by the public. The public is a stakeholder in the outcome of this report. I am strongly of the view that the public is entitled to the publication of the report so that it can debate it and be consulted on it. I also take the view that the 12,000 men and women in the Garda Síochána are entitled to see that report because they are not only stakeholders but shareholders in the future of the Garda Síochána and are entitled to be fully consulted and to have their views taken into account. What we do not want is the drip-feed to the media on the basis of suiting the Minister in regard to information in that report. I say publish and be damned. The public is entitled to the full information in that report, as is the Garda Síochána. If the Minister has anything to say or any announcements to make on the report, any such announcements can only be considered in the context of the publication of the full report, otherwise it cannot be properly assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Since the foundations of the State, the Garda Síochána has provided unrivalled service and marvellous commitment. The Garda was one of the first pillars of the State to be put in place by the provisional Government in 1923. I do not believe I would be overstating it if I said it was an institution of the State. Despite occasional criticisms, there is an incredible degree of goodwill towards the Garda. People have confidence in the gardaí and they take great comfort from seeing a garda on the beat, but there is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">When travelling to Leinster House — I come a long distance from west Cork — there is a fair chance that the only garda I am likely to see will be at the gates of the House. Why is that? We must consider that fact. Having gardaí on the beat not only eases the mind of the public, but it thwarts the deeds of the criminal. Since this Government came to power seven years ago, it has choked the resources of the Garda to such an extent that it is now quite rare to see a garda on the beat.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Another important point to make in regard to the Garda Síochána is that it is an unarmed force. It is a point I need to make because one of the many passing references from the Minister which got a headline some months ago was one to the possible arming of gardaí, which would be a disastrous mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The motion leads off on the question of Garda station closures. Local Garda stations serve a far greater purpose than one might initially believe. They do more than serve as an office for the gardaí; they are a focal point in the communities which they serve. They serve as a link between the gardaí and those communities. What is also important is that the Garda Síochána can give great service when it has information. The more Garda stations, whether in the inner cities or in rural areas, the more information available to members of the force serving in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">That gives rise to the question of the position on Garda stations. What is their future? What is the situation in regard to the downgrading or otherwise of Garda stations? I am totally confused. In Templemore last month, it was reported that the Minister clearly indicated some Garda stations were to close. I understand that was not in his script, which makes it even more confusing. If Garda stations are to close, the Minister should make a clear statement on the issue and give us the list of the stations he has in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">To make the issue even more confusing, there was a statement from the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, on local radio in his area categorically stating that no Garda stations would close in Laoighis-Offaly. Has he seen the list or is he merely improvising on the hoof for local consumption in Laoighis-Offaly? What is needed is a full and comprehensive statement on this issue. According to newspaper reports on future plans for the Garda Síochána, there is a suggestion that a range of stations will be downgraded. Such downgrading would obviously have implications for the service and the numbers available in such stations as well as for opening hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I cannot emphasise too much the importance of the Minister's being absolutely up front on this issue. The local elections are over and the people have made it clear they are not satisfied with the way this Government is carrying on its business. One of the major changes which must take place is that all members of this Government should be open, transparent and honest. I suggest that is even more important in the case of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, in regard to Garda stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The same issue arises in regard to the equipping of the Garda Síochána. A recent case in the District Court in Cork showed that the law did not match the equipment the Garda Síochána had or possibly the equipment did not match the law. What was absolutely clear in that case was that the Garda was not being properly equipped with modern equipment to enable it to enforce the law. The modern criminal is very much up to pace on the issue of technology. Modern technology enables criminals to operate in a different way and, therefore, as far as technology is concerned, the gardaí must be in a position to cope with any modern advances.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">In the case of drug dealing, the idea of drugs being exchanged on the streets is gone. I understand there are few street corner drug dealers. The modern <i>modus operandi </i>is dial-a-deal. The dealer has a car and a mobile telephone and is, in many instances, untraceable.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">From the point of view of equipment, gardaí must be fully resourced, but they have not been. A commitment must be given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of the balance of resources available during the remainder of his term of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The real problem facing the Garda Síochána is the lack of numbers. This problem has long been recognised. It is not rocket science. It was fully admitted and isolated by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats as the main issue regarding the Garda Síochána prior to the last election. That resulted in a clear and unequivocal commitment from both parties to increase Garda numbers. There was no doubting the figures. It was proposed to employ 2,000 extra gardaí, in addition to the 11,800 gardaí already employed. That promise was reinforced in the programme for Government entered into immediately after the election, yet what has happened? It is not only that the extra numbers have not been provided, but what is worse, from the point of view of the Garda Síochána and members of the public who want them, the necessary facilities to provide for extra gardaí have not even been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Other than an occasional promise or a headline from the Minister, there is not even a draft plan to put in place the necessary facilities which will start the process of increasing the output from Templemore. The college there is now operating at full capacity. It is not possible for extra numbers to be trained there on the basis of existing facilities. It is time we knew exactly what will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">At one stage when this matter was raised with the Minister, it elicited the usual weasel words, "when economic circumstances permit". There was no question of economic circumstances being a factor when these promises were made. In any event the figures show that economic circumstances are not an issue. The promise that was made should be kept. I want the Minister to now spell out exactly the Government's intention in this respect and what will be done to address this need during the remaining few years of the lifetime of this Government. Unless there is an accelerated rate of recruitment, the numbers might be lower at the end of the term of this Government, taking account of Garda retirement and other circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">This is all a backdrop to the increase in crime levels and concern about it among the public. I get sick and tired of reading that the level of this or that crime has increased or decreased by 2% and of massaging and manipulation of the figures. From the published official reports the figures are clear. There were 85,000 headline crimes in 1998, the first full year in office of the parties in government. The figure in 2002 was 106,000 crimes. We read occasional headlines and statements from the Minister that the level of a particular crime has increased by 2% or decreased by 4%. There are lies, damned lies and statistics. Let us not avoid the point. There is an enormous increased level of crime here, partly due to an increasing level of urbanisation. There are many ways of dealing with this problem. One is to have a sufficient number of gardaí. That is accepted and recognised by everybody, yet the commitment to provide them has not been kept. What is the Minister's reaction to the failure to honour that commitment? What strategy will be put in place to address this need over the next two years, or is the Minister throwing in the towel on addressing this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_561">On that front, another aspect must be taken into account. We should be slow to send young offenders or perpetrators of minor crimes to prison. We should use alternative strategies to deal with them. There is a need for prisons, but there is some confusion about the issue. The Minister made announcements about building new prisons, but these are plans on paper. It will be many years before new prisons are built whereas a number of prisons have been closed but that is not set out on a paper plan. Approximately, one in every 20 convicted criminals is on early or temporary release. There is a shortage of prison places. Our prison system runs at about 98% of capacity every day. We seem to be rapidly heading back to the revolving door syndrome. It is important that the Minister's plans in that regard are fully spelt out.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The motion notes the commitment to increase Garda numbers by 2,000. It also notes the conflicting statements concerning the closure of Garda stations. The Government should let the public know what is planned. Making vague, general policy statements and then expecting the Garda Síochána to bear the political flack because of restricted budgets is not the way to deal with this issue. It is important that we have clear statements from the political head responsible, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and if there is political flack, it is not in the interests of members of the Garda Síochána that it is diverted to them. The Minister is paid to take the flack. The approach I outlined is not an acceptable one to be followed by the Government or the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The motion also notes the level of public concern about the unacceptable level of public order offences. That speaks for itself. We have given the figures, but there has not been an answer from the Government. The motion deplores the Government's delay in publishing the SMI Report on Garda Síochána Structures and Organisation. Drip-feeding it to the public is not the way to deal with it. The Government should publish it and get the Minister's reaction to it. Six months is long enough for it to have been left gathering dust on the Minister's desk.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">These are enormously serious issues for members of the public and members of the Garda Síochána. It is time for a change of approach. The message from the general public is clear. The Minister might be the first in the firing line from the point of view of a change of approach. The approach adopted in recent years has not worked. The implementation report should be published. The Minister should indicate clearly what will happen to Garda numbers over the last couple of years of the Government's term of office.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_565">I agree with my colleague about the state of law and order. It is clear the Government is failing in every respect, particularly in terms of the promises it made before the last general election. If one reads <i> The Irish Times </i>website, one can see the assessment of the newspaper’s correspondent before that election was that the Fianna Fáil-PD coalition’s plan for 2,000 extra gardaí was the key to its election programme. However, the plan was not implemented. The core of the Fianna Fáil-PD manifesto lies in tatters, while crime is increasing in every respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Since 1998, the first full year of the current Government's term in office, official annual crime figures have increased from 85,000 in that year to nearly 106,000 in 2002. There has been a small reduction since then but, nevertheless, crime has never been so bad and the Government has been dealing with the issue ineffectively. We have heard more blather from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform than from any other Minister for years, but where is the action? Where are the gardaí who are so badly needed? The Minister has failed to keep his promise and the Government's approach to law and order is a disgrace — it is all talk and no action.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Firearms offences are increasing on our city streets and hardly a week goes by without someone being shot in connection with drug-related activities. It is a shame and a disgrace. There was an awful tragedy in Tallaght recently when an innocent person was murdered in bed by people with guns. What is the Minister doing about it? Where is his action plan? What is his approach? Where is his credibility? At this stage he does not have any.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The incidence of rape has increased by over 30% and over 1,300 additional households were burgled in the 12 months to the end of March this year. Approximately 25,652 houses were burgled in that period. What a failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Extra gardaí are badly needed but other measures are also required. This side of the House does not have a problem with examining a reorganisation of the Garda Síochána. The Minister should examine what other countries have done to deal with crime. Cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco have managed to deal with late-night crime. The reality in Ireland, however, is that there are less gardaí on duty late at night and at weekends than during the day. It is hard to find a garda on the beat in urban areas late at night and at weekends. The Minister should ensure that Garda resources are reallocated within his existing budget so that gardaí will be available to patrol late at night, including weekends. Most gardaí should be on duty when most crimes are committed. The Minister shouts loudly about law and order, but if he is committed to public order he should ensure that gardaí are available at such times. He has failed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I recently tabled a question to the Minister asking him how many gardaí were on duty in County Louth on St. Patrick's Day, but he could not tell me. When I tabled another question asking how many public order offences were committed in County Louth on St. Patrick's Day I was told there was one in Drogheda, seven in Dundalk and 14 in Ardee, the smallest town in the county. Those statistics told me absolutely nothing, however, except that there were probably more gardaí on duty in Ardee that night than in Drogheda, which has a population in excess of 30,000. I have been told that there were four gardaí on duty that day in Drogheda. Will the Minister confirm that? He has refused to answer my questions in the Dáil and will not provide facts and figures. The Minister has failed miserably.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Some 2,000 additional gardaí were promised by the Government during the 2002 general election campaign, which was to be in addition to the creation of a traffic corps. The Minister has conceded that this will not now be created. This is despite the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, continues to delude himself and the public that the traffic corps will be created. The result is that the positive impact of the penalty points system is being eroded because there is a lack of enforcement by the Garda. Roads deaths are currently up 12 on the figures for the corresponding period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">A road safety expert, commissioned by the Department of Transport to examine the effectiveness of road safety measures, was able to drive the length and breadth of the country without encountering any Garda presence. What is going on? What is the Government doing? It has frozen and is doing nothing about this issue. It is all talk and no action.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The National Safety Council has no confidence in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enforce penalty points, as the Department refuses to resource the Garda Síochána. The NSC's chairman, Mr. Eddie Shaw, said recently that it was a matter of profound, personal disappointment that it has not been possible to convince the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that investment in modern technology and supporting management and administration resources for road traffic law enforcement is a worthwhile priority for our community or the Exchequer. That is a damning indictment and it shows the Minister's total lack of commitment to deal with these issues. Gardaí support this view themselves. They claim that with existing resources they can only carry out 3% of the spot checks required of them and, therefore, it would be impossible for them to meet the increased requirements anticipated under the, as yet, unpublished national road safety strategy 2003-2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Minister should also examine the issue of drug driving. A study into drug use by motorists has found that of 2,000 specimens analysed by the medical bureau of road safety, almost 16% tested positive for one or more drugs. Cannabis was the drug most commonly found in six out of ten drivers who tested positive. Of the samples taken from drivers under 25, some 25% tested positive for drugs, while the figure was 19% for the 25-34 age group. They are worrying statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Other statistics are even sadder. We are shocked every weekend to read of more deaths occurring in road accidents where only one vehicle is involved. In many such cases there must be a deep suspicion that alcohol or other drugs were involved in such crashes. The only way to reduce these deaths is by having more gardaí to enforce the law, especially late at weekends, but the Minister is failing utterly in his duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Illegal drug use is on the increase but I want to praise members of the Garda Síochána for their commitment in seizing drugs, particularly heroin and cocaine. If gardaí are not on the beat in the affected communities, however, we will continue to experience an increase in such problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">There is low morale in the Garda Síochána due to the Minister's lack of action. The Government lacks conviction to do the work and make the necessary investment to combat crime. It has failed utterly in this regard. The Minister rides his white horse in pursuit of law and order but he may as well be in the sands of Libya because he is not beating the problem of crime. He needs to reappraise radically the promises he made and to examine the money in his kitty. It should be invested where it is needed most in the Garda Síochána's fight against crime in our communities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_578">It gives me no pleasure to speak on this motion because there is great concern about the issue in rural Ireland. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently attended a Garda ceremony at which he referred to the closure of rural Garda stations. This is at a time when there is more crime and people no longer bother to report it because, in some rural Garda stations, there is no one to report it to. Instead, people must speak into a microphone at the station without knowing whether anyone is listening. They have decided as a result that there is no point doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">This Government and its predecessor brought before this House legislation on pub opening hours which has been the greatest disaster ever to befall this country and it is now time the Minister and his Department re-examined the issue. I left the count centre in Castlebar last Sunday night and travelled through two different towns. It reminded me of English football thugs on the rampage, as they are in Portugal again this week. One sees 300 to 400 people coming out of night-clubs and on to the streets, belting, kicking and battering one another, yet there is no Garda presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Minister gave a commitment to the people that he would increase Garda numbers by 2,000. However, more gardaí are retiring early and going on sick leave because of the pressure of the job and the injuries they receive from thugs late at night while on the job. We have fewer gardaí on the street than 20 years ago despite our growing population and this, along with the incidence of new crimes and an influx of foreigners into the country, places an increasing amount of pressure on the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I have great confidence and faith in the force when it is given the resources it needs. When Veronica Guerin was murdered, drug dealers in Dublin city thought they could do what they liked. However, when the Garda was given the resources, manpower and legislation, it dealt with them. They were hunted out of the city and many of the criminals are now behind bars, an achievement on which I compliment the force. All of this proves the point that if the Garda is given the resources, it can do the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Like politicians, some gardaí have not upheld the honour of their wonderful uniform. At the foundation of the State, the first Government established the Garda Síochána and my grand-uncle, Joe Ring, helped to do so. He died in the service of his country and I am proud of him and the people who have worn the uniform. The people who discredit the uniform by not doing their job properly must be weeded out and dealt with. That is not a criticism of the force of whose members I am proud for the excellent job they do. However, anyone who does not obey the law must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Minister gave a commitment which he must honour. The people spoke last weekend and sent a strong message to the Government that it cannot get away with broken promises. People want to feel safe in their homes and believe that if they telephone a Garda station, they will have as quick a response as possible. In most areas in which the Garda has the resources, its members have done their job well. President Bush is to visit the country in a few weeks' time and the Minister will deploy thousands of gardaí from rural areas in the cities. The same has happened during Ireland's EU Presidency. Gardaí were taken from every station throughout the country and re-deployed in Dublin city. That is not right or fair because rural Ireland, as well as every other part of the country, deserves to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Whatever it takes, whether it is money, resources or space in Templemore for recruits, the Minister made a commitment which he should honour and let the people know they can be protected by the Garda Síochána. He should give the force the resources. It can do the job, as it has proven in the past and I know will do again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_585">I strongly support the Fine Gael motion. I am disappointed with the feeble response in the Government's amendment to the motion. It asks the Dáil to note the Government's firm commitment to achieving a strength of 14,000 gardaí. However, the Government has no real commitment to that statement because, two years after the promise was made in the Government parties' general election manifestos, it has still not been fulfilled. How firm is a commitment which has not yet been achieved? Will the Government take a lesson from the election results and realise that people will no longer tolerate false and broken promises?</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Government amendment to the motion goes on to note the significant increase in the budget provision for the Garda Síochána of more than €1 billion, for the first time representing an increase of 75%. However, what has that 75% increase achieved? It has not achieved anything in Galway city. In 2000, 159 gardaí were stationed in Millstreet Garda station and 41 in Salthill, which covers Salthill to Oughterard and Lettermore. However, just three years later, Salthill's complement had fallen to 39 gardaí and Millstreet's increased to 163. Four years later, the same number of gardaí are stationed in Galway city. This has happened under the reign of this and the previous Administration in which the Minister's party and Fianna Fáil were partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">In that time, the population of Galway city has increased by anything up to 10,000 or 12,000 people. New housing estates have been built on each side of the city, bringing with them new problems. There are now vast suburban areas in which there are no facilities such as playing pitches or community halls. People congregate on the streets, antagonise and make life impossible for others living on the estates and who have enough problems moving there. Although it is not within the terms of this motion, such facilities should be provided before the houses are complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I was canvassing last week in an area in which vast tracts of open space which were supposed to be developed have been left derelict because some hitch prevented the builder from doing so and the residents must live with the problems such a situation brings. There is also a great deal of rented property on such housing estates, a minority of tenants of which are on rent supplement and making life a hell for their neighbours who live in fear, yet nothing can be done about it. I approached the health board on the matter, which confirmed that a named person was in receipt of rent supplement. When I asked if the rent supplement could be stopped because of the anti-social behaviour, I was informed the health board has no authority to do so. If the house in question were owned by Galway City Council, it could evict the tenant on proof of anti-social behaviour. However, nothing can be done about people in rented properties paid for by taxpayers through rent supplement because there is no provision for doing so. Will the Minister address this?</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, looked worried on last night's edition of "Questions and Answers". He was the Minister for "zero tolerance", but the current Minister is the Minister for zero action. I hate to say that and I do not mean it personally but no action has been taken to fulfil the Government's election promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The Government amendment also acknowledges that the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner based on his professional assessment of operational requirements. If that is the case, why should a promise to increase the number of gardaí by 2,000 be used for political advantage in an election?</p>
          <p eId="para_591">There is a growing problem in the cities. Deputy Ring referred to night-clubs, the legislation in regard to which I have never understood. There are five or six night clubs in Galway City all of which close at 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m. when 2,000 young people, including members of my family, come out on the street. The chipper or the take-away is packed. People queue for taxis and there are bound to be disturbances. As a parent, when the members of my family go out at night I do not know whether they will come home safely. There should be a regulation whereby there would be staggered closing hours, by agreement with the night clubs. One night club should close this week at 1 a.m., another at 2 a.m. and another at 12.30 a.m. and the order could be reversed the following week so that people would come on to the streets in an orderly manner, go to the take-away, get a taxi home in a safe manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I ask the Minister to provide the promised 2,000 gardaí and not to allow that commitment become another broken promise of the Government.</p>

          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_593">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_594">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_595">"—notes the Government's firm commitment to achieving a force strength of 14,000 members;</p>
          <p eId="para_596">—acknowledges the achievement in 2003 of a Garda force strength in excess of 12,000 members for the first time since the founding of the force;</p>
          <p eId="para_597">—notes the imminent achievement during 2004 of the current maximum authorised strength of the force at 12,200 members;</p>
          <p eId="para_598">—notes the significant increase achieved in the budget provision for the Garda Vote, bringing the total allocation to the Garda Síochána to over €1 billion for the first time, which represents an increase of over 75% on the €600 million allocated in 1997;</p>
          <p eId="para_599">—welcomes the recent decrease in the level of recorded crime and the success of the Garda Síochána in combating public order offences;</p>
          <p eId="para_600">—congratulates the Garda Síochána on its ongoing successes in countering subversion and terrorism and in seizing illegal drugs and the proceeds of organised crime;</p>
          <p eId="para_601">—congratulates the Garda Síochána on its success in investigating and detecting murders committed by criminal gangs;</p>
          <p eId="para_602">—welcomes the publication by the Minister of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 and its objective of radically modernising the Garda Síochána and of establishing the independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission;</p>
          <p eId="para_603">—acknowledges that the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner based on his professional assessment of the operational requirements;</p>
          <p eId="para_604">—commends the Government's record in continuing to strengthen the criminal law over the past seven years through unprecedented legislative reform;</p>
          <p eId="para_605">—welcomes the Transforming State Assets Initiative whereby existing Garda accommodation is being replaced by new, more appropriate accommodation;</p>
          <p eId="para_606">—notes the programme of modernisation and reform for the Garda Síochána currently in train under the Strategic Management Initiative and supported by the Garda Síochána Bill 2004;</p>
          <p eId="para_607">—welcomes the publication of the final report of the Garda SMI implementation steering group, the contents of which have been the subject of widespread consultation among interested parties;</p>
          <p eId="para_608">—welcomes the open and transparent consultative and drafting process which produced the final report; and</p>
          <p eId="para_609">—considers that the Report will be of significant assistance to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in preparing the first three-year strategy statement under the terms of the Garda Síochána Bill once enacted."</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The motion by the Fine Gael Party seeks to raise, or should I say generate, concern over different aspects of the Garda Síochána, namely Garda numbers, the closure of Garda stations and the final report of the Garda SMI steering group, as well as the level of public order offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">On the issue of Garda numbers I wish to affirm, as the amendment does, that it is the Government's policy and firm commitment to achieve a force strength of 14,000 members.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">Before the last election Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, in separate manifestos, made that commitment. After the last election the two parties put in place a programme for Government which had that as one of its principal features. Those are solemn commitments. They are commitments which bind politicians. They cannot be reneged upon. They cannot be cast aside. They demand implementation.</p>

Some weeks ago I asked the Government, in view of the situation which now exists, to give me permission to bring before it proposals for the implementation of that commitment.

          <p eId="para_621">The reason this commitment was entered into is that Ireland has a growing population. Ireland is increasingly urbanised and has increasing challenges in terms of the drug culture, the drink culture and areas where the Garda was never engaged in such numbers previously, for example in immigration control and such matters to which reference has been made by Opposition speakers.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">Also President's visits and the prevention of international terrorism. The case for the extra Garda is easily made.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Coupled with that is a point which has been made by Deputies O'Keeffe and O'Dowd that the Government is also committed to a proper implementation of our road traffic law. The road traffic law is a matter of lives. Implementation or non-implementation of the road traffic law is a matter which is reflected in lives lost and lives ruined by long-term injury and vast costs to the Exchequer arising out of both types of tragedy which they incur. The imperative to increase the size of the Garda Síochána in accordance with the Government's commitment is clear and unequivocal. Whatever grounds of a budgetary nature have existed to hesitate before engaging in increased expenditure, those grounds must give way to delivery on a solemn commitment. It is my intention and that of the Government that this should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Without wishing to be divisive, I should remind the Opposition that its criticism on this issue is particularly hollow. The strength of the force declined from 10,882 on 31 December 1993 to 10,827 on 31 December 1994, declined further to 10,816 in 1995, and declined even further to 10,804 on 31 December 1996. Not alone that, but in the last general election the Fine Gael and Labour parties set out their respective programmes for the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system and neither made any commitment whatsoever to an increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána.</p>

Templemore will have to be used more intensively to give effect to the requirement for this major increase in Garda strength. I have spoken with the Garda Commissioner no later than yesterday about the necessity to get an increased number through Templemore. It can and will be done. I am committed to ensuring that the Garda Síochána has, in addition to sufficient personnel, all the resources it needs to deal efficiently and effectively with the challenges it faces.</p>

This represents a 9.5% increase in the Garda Vote for 2004. The Garda budget is at an historic high, having reached €1.054 billion. The resources secured for the Garda Síochána are an increase of 75% over the figure allocated in 1997. The budget for Garda salaries, wages and allowances includes an increase in overtime provision of over €7 million, from €51 million to €58 million in a single year, which is a significant increase of 13.3%. In addition, an extra €7.5 million for Garda overtime was provided to take account of the EU Presidency obligations.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_635">The motion also raises the question of the closure of Garda stations. Let me deal with this along with a related issue raised by the motion, namely the alleged delay in publishing the final report of the Garda SMI steering group.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The strategic management initiative in the Garda Síochána has been under way since 1997 and a great deal of work has been done. Far reaching recommendations in a previous Garda SMI report on performance and accountability have been included in the Garda Síochána Bill which is currently before the Seanad. The current report is the final report of the Garda SMI steering group. It deals with important aspects of the organisation and structure of the Garda Síochána, and it will inform the Garda Commissioner of the kind of strategic planning envisaged for the Garda organisation when the Garda Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The allegation that this final report of the Garda SMI group has in some way been suppressed is absurd. The report covers many aspects of the organisation and structure of the force and it was entirely natural that careful consideration of its proposals was warranted before the publication of the report and the response to it. However, in order to prevent the distraction of any claim by the Opposition that the report is in some way being kept secret, I am making copies available. It is published today and can be read on the Department's website.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_638">We got something out of the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_282" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_639">In compiling this report a lengthy period of consultation was undertaken by the Garda SMI steering group and a related review group. I take this opportunity to thank them for their commitment and dedication to the task. This was an inclusive, consultative process involving Garda management, the Garda representative associations, officials of interested Departments and outside consultants. In a nutshell, their task was to give advice and make recommendations as to how the very challenging and wide ranging proposals for change and enhanced efficiency in the Garda Síochána made in an earlier report of a different grouping — the 1997 steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána — could be translated into reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Before describing briefly the other main recommendations of the report, let me go straight to the issue raised by the motion, namely, the closure of Garda stations. The Garda SMI report makes recommendations on the use of Garda stations in the Dublin metropolitan region — and that region only — and proposes four different types of station based on public demand. During the course of reviews it was found that between 80% and 90% of customers call to Garda stations during regular office hours. There are very few callers outside these hours and fewer still during the night.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The types of station being proposed range from divisional headquarters with offices, custody suites, staff facilities and a public office on a 24-hour basis, to public offices which would open between one and eight hours a day to facilitate the various requirements of the public. The objective of reduced public opening hours is to get gardaí out from behind public counters at times when there is little demand for their services, and out on the beat on the streets of the city where they are needed. The report estimates that these proposals to change the opening hours of public offices in about a dozen stations in the Dublin metropolitan region could release the equivalent of 240 full-time gardaí and sergeants onto the streets at night when their visible presence would assist in the prevention of crime. That is exactly the point that Deputy Ring was making in his speech.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>

          <p eId="para_643">I emphasise that I have made no decision on this or any other proposal in the report. Indeed, in this and other aspects of the report, the Garda Commissioner will, under the provisions of the Garda Síochána Bill, have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform, and I believe this report will be of considerable assistance to him in that task.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_645">Other key recommendations of the report include the re-structuring of Garda headquarters to ensure better emphasis on strategy, planning, evaluation and performance management, including the appointment of a third Deputy Commissioner to head up a strategy and performance branch; and the reorganisation of Garda regions, divisions and districts throughout the country, reducing the number of regions by one, reducing the number of divisions by five and reducing the number of districts by between 20 and 32.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">This is in the report. They have not been identified in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Other recommendations include the outsourcing of the maintenance of the Garda fleet; new improved procedures for the presentation by gardaí of evidence in court, including the establishment of a criminal justice management unit in the Dublin metropolitan region; the Garda national drugs unit to have a more co-ordinated national policy and strategy on drugs; the establishment of an organised crime unit within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation; the creation of a new head of procurement, with improved procurement processes, to achieve greater efficiencies; a more pro-active approach to community policing, with clearly defined roles, functions and management practices; and a clearer definition of the respective role of each rank.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">All of these recommendations, each important in its own respect, will fall to be considered for implementation as part of the on-going process of Garda reform, a process which has already delivered tangible results. Under the umbrella of SMI, for example, new rosters have been developed and agreed with staff associations and where introduced so far have enabled management to ensure greater operational presence on the streets at peak times. A new financial management framework has been established, headed by a civilian director of finance and assisted by financial and management accountants. This has played no small part in bringing about significantly improved budgetary discipline. This will be vital in enabling the Commissioner to accept responsibility as Accounting Officer for the force under the Garda Bill which, as I have mentioned, implements key recommendations of the previous SMI performance and accountability report.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Those are the key recommendations of the Garda SMI report. That is what it says, and that is all it says, about the public opening hours of Garda stations in Dublin. The House will see that there is no grand plan to close Garda stations — though some will be disappointed to hear that. In fact, the House will be interested to hear details of the extensive programme of building and renovation of Garda stations that is under way. The OPW, which is responsible for funding capital works to Garda stations, expects that some €13 million will be allocated this year to the Garda building programme. A further €5 million, approximately, will be spent on more minor works projects. In addition, there is provision in the Garda Vote of €6.6 million for the maintenance of Garda properties. In all, 2004 will see in the order of €25 million spent on various Garda building projects. This does not include additional funding expected from the transforming State assets initiative.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_290" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_652">I have had discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, at the OPW who has commenced a pilot scheme of equity exchange — part of the transforming State assets initiative. The pilot scheme involves eight Garda stations in Tipperary and Limerick. The aim of the scheme is to replace the existing Garda accommodation at these eight locations with eight new, more appropriate facilities by offering for sale the existing stations. No closures are involved and no station will be vacated until its replacement has been provided and is operational. I am sorry to disappoint the House again.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I understand that the OPW has appointed external consultants to progress this matter and they are expected to report to the board shortly. If this pilot proves successful, it is intended to extend the scheme to other areas and stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">More generally, the transforming State assets initiative involves the sale of properties which are surplus to requirements across the public sector. Surplus funds accruing will be re-invested in four key areas earmarked by the Government. Two of these areas are the purchase of sites for Garda stations and the Garda buildings maintenance programme. This re-investment process has already begun and the Garda programmes have already begun to see the benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">In my part of Dublin, within a Tiger Woods drive, there are four Garda stations. If Tiger Woods had a clear line of vision from St. Stephen's Green he could hit Pearse Street Garda station, Kevin Street Garda station, Harcourt Terrace Garda station and Harcourt Square Garda station. It may well be that Members think that is satisfactory, but I do not. I think our changing population requires different solutions. For instance, Kevin Street Garda station is housed in the remains of the medieval palace of St. Sepulchre. Another is housed in a very valuable site on Harcourt Terrace which, combined with an old butter testing station, must be one of the most valuable inner city sites and is about a two minute walk or less from Harcourt Square, which is the location of Garda headquarters. These issues must be borne in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">During the period 2002-03 the following stations were completed: Kilmacthomas area HQ, County Waterford; Cobh district HQ, County Cork; Kilrush district HQ, County Clare; Thomastown district HQ, County Kilkenny; Tourmakeady, County Mayo, basic unit; Roundstone, County Galway, basic unit; Clifden district HQ, County Galway; Blanchardstown, special drugs unit; Ballymore, County Westmeath, basic unit; Rathangan, County Kildare, basic unit; Ballinrobe area HQ, County Mayo; Kilmihil County Clare, basic unit; Mill Street, County Galway, additional accommodation; and phase 3 of the Talbot premises, Santry, major Garda stores and repository.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The motion also refers to the level of public order offences, and let me say a few words on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">There have never been more resources available in the fight against crime. The number of gardaí has increased to an all-time high. The funding for the Garda Síochána has passed the €1 billion mark. The Commissioner has very significant resources at his disposal in terms of a well-trained and highly-motivated force, specialised units, infrastructural assets and technical assistance to respond to the challenges of the fight against crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">It is undeniably the case that in recent years excessive alcohol consumption has led to an increase in the number of offences. While factors such as an increase in disposable income available to individuals and fundamental changes in the values held by some in our society, contribute to this increase, they cannot be used to justify public order offences. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I am committed to bringing the necessary resources and legislative provisions into place to tackle this issue. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 have given gardaí significant additional powers to deal with public order offences and street crime. As a result of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003, gardaí can now target a range of premises where disorder is known to occur. This does not only apply to licensed premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 places restrictions on the sale of alcohol to those under 18 years and drunkenness on the premises. Licence holders are very much aware of these stringent provisions and it is my view that they are more vigilant as a result. Since the introduction of the original Intoxicating Liquor Act in 2000, to which Deputy Ring referred, and its strengthening through further legislation in 2003, 713 licensed premises have been prosecuted through the courts resulting in 377 convictions, including 275 closure orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The administration of the national age cards scheme by the Garda Síochána has facilitated the gardaí, in co-operation with the licensed trade, in addressing and combating the problem of under age drinking. In advance of those legislative measures, the gardaí in Cork established a partnership with the local entertainment industry, the local district Judiciary and Cork City Council, the result of which was that, in 2003, there was a 33% reduction in public order offences and, in the first part of this year, there was a further reduction of 17%.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I urge local authorities to make use of the powers they have been given under the Intoxicating Liquor Act to decide policy on closing hours in their areas and whether 2.30 a.m. is an appropriate closing time. I have given those powers through the Act, which we piloted through this House, to members of local authorities and I hope they will now avail of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I do not want to bore Deputies with statistics on offences detected and dealt with under Operation Encounter and its successor, Operation Boulevard. Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that I am massaging figures or lying through statistics, but the Garda Síochána, not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has reduced crime over the past two years. The rate of crime is decreasing. That does not refer only to serious crime——</p>

          <p eId="para_684">The introduction of a statutory provision allowing for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences will enhance the power of the Garda Síochána to deal with such offences in an efficient and effective way and offer an alternative to a court prosecution. Such a procedure would be similar to the fixed penalty procedure in respect of road traffic offences whereby a person charged with a relevant offence is issued with a written notice indicating that if he or she pays the appropriate penalty within a certain period, he or she will avoid prosecution before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I also intend to bring forward proposals to Government to seek approval for the inclusion — whether on publication or on Committee Stage — of firearms control provisions in the Bill. In addition, I am examining the issues surrounding sentencing in relation to drug trafficking offences and firearms offences, and if I consider it appropriate, I will bring forward further measures to strengthen the law in that area. The criminal justice Bill represents a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will impact on all types of crime. My proposals will be effective yet measured to ensure the necessary balance is achieved between maintaining the rights of the individual while at the same time ensuring the optimum protection of society against the criminal.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The Law Reform Commission recently published a consultation paper on the establishment of a DNA databank and I am examining the issues highlighted there and look forward to hearing the views and opinions of those who will take part in the consultation process.

Is not he the Minister who said on one occasion that if there were more gardaí put on the beat, more crime would be detected and crime figures would increase as a result? I doubt that he intended to put it in quite that way but he was acknowledging the fact and he has done his best to ensure that there are no extra gardaí on the beat. As a result, the amount of crime that might otherwise be detected has not been detected and the figures happen to be relatively stable.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">There were two commitments on justice in the Government manifesto, on both of which the Government has reneged. One was to produce night and weekend courts, and the other was to employ 2,000 extra gardaí. These promises have patently not been delivered and, half way into the Government's term, there is no sign of delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The Minister has acknowledged on numerous occasions in the House that it will be impossible to recruit 2,000 gardaí during the term of office of the Government because Templemore does not have the capacity to accommodate such numbers. He also stated that Rome was not built in a day and these additional gardaí could not be recruited during the first or second years of the lifetime of the Government. When its five-year term of office has passed, only a fraction, at best, of those 2,000 gardaí will have been recruited. No steps have been taken, in remedial terms, to extend the existing facilities at Templemore, to provide new facilities there or to do anything that would allow the additional gardaí to be recruited.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I am in possession of figures which show that in the past two years 833 recruits graduated from Templemore, while 813 gardaí retired. It would be difficult to reach the target of 2,000 additional gardaí on the basis of those figures. The Garda Representative Association, GRA, stated that at the current rate of progress it will be 2038 before the target figure is reached. There is no point making commitments and bold statements that these will be delivered upon when such delivery is clearly not taking place and when there are no steps or measures in place to ensure that it will take place in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_709">The Minister may have more difficulty in proceeding with station closures than he may hitherto have thought would have been the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">There is no way the recruitment promised can be delivered upon because the capacity does not exist at Templemore. No steps have been taken to provide that capacity. Action will have to be taken in that regard. Either the capacity will be provided at Templemore or it will have to be provided elsewhere. I previously put forward a proposal in this regard. The Grangegorman development agency Bill was promised before the most recent general election and it was promised on numerous occasions prior to the local elections. It has not yet appeared, even though it was promised this session. When the Dublin Institute of Technology is transferred to Grangegorman, I propose that an extra faculty, namely, a police academy, be added to the existing six faculties. This would allow us to provide a location at which young Garda recruits could complete their training in an urban setting in proximity to their peers attending a third level institution, namely, the DIT.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I have always considered that it is undesirable that all Garda training should take place in a sort of secondary boarding school located in a rural setting and removed from the urban environment where most policing takes place. In addition to establishing a police academy at Grangegorman, we could approach the PSNI which is also encountering difficulties because its old college in Belfast is in a bad state of repair. I imagine it would not be impossible to suggest a location at which training could be provided for members of the police forces from both parts of the island. We should move forward with such an initiative because it would foster co-operation. We desperately need to provide additional capacity in respect of Garda training. The new facilities to which I refer should be provided in an urban setting, particularly as more than 60% of the population lives in that type of setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Crime remains a major problem despite what the Minister says, with 300 serious crimes committed daily. Due attention has not been paid to serious headline crimes. The Minister referred to public order crimes and stated that a serious problem exists. There is also a serious problem as regards crime in the community. This gives rise to concerns about the security of elderly people and creates fear. There is a lack of liaison and contact between the Garda and members of the community in many instances. A great deal of work should already have been done in this area. The legislation promised, the Garda Síochána Bill, should already be in place so that with the local elections over the liaison committees could be established to provide a community link between the Garda and local authorities. It would have been great if this could have been up and running at this stage. However, there is no sign of it at all. That is another promise which has not been delivered upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The incidence of a number of headline offences is growing rapidly. One of the most serious of these is sexual assault. The numbers of such assaults have increased dramatically in every one of the past five years and many of them go unreported. We are, therefore, only seeing the tip of the iceberg and do not yet have the real figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The other area in which there has been a major increase is the incidence of gangland crimes and murders. The easy availability of firearms is a matter of concern. Those who commit gangland crimes are seldom caught, prosecuted or sent to prison. This is a worrying phenomenon that has not been dealt with and there is no evidence the Minister has a policy in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">How will the position be improved if the Minister proceeds to close urban Garda stations? He referred to getting 240 gardaí out from behind their desks and on to the streets. The Garda Representative Association has agreed to accept civilian personnel working in Garda stations in place of gardaí. It has stated that, instead of the 240 gardaí to which the Minister refers, 700 officers could be released on to the streets if there was a process of civilianisation in respect of non-official Garda duties. A great deal of work could be done on that. The Minister will not get extra gardaí out on to the streets by closing Garda stations. He proposes to close the Fitzgibbon Street and Mountjoy stations in my constituency, both of which are located in areas where intensive crime levels exist. This proposal will go down very badly with communities that are already under pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">There are many issues we could discuss in respect of this valuable motion. The Minister must look at the broader picture. He must consider the entire criminal justice system, in respect of which he does not have a policy. He must consider the number of gardaí, the manner of the force's operations, its accountability and structures and ensure they are linked to accountability. He must also look at the courts and the fact that they are operating in a chaotic fashion. In addition, he must consider the prisons which are in a squalid condition. The Minister is closing down prisons left, right and centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the motion and hope the Minister will listen to what is said in respect of it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_718">It is the Government's failure to produce any kind of serious response in respect of community policing which hurts and afflicts people most. People's lives, homes and property are being damaged and their enjoyment of the benefits of economic growth are, in many instances, being destroyed as a result of harassment and petty and serious crime. The people's sense of security and well-being has been taken away. Women are afraid to walk the streets at night. Young men and teenagers are afraid to go into town at night. The Government has shown complete indifference to the kind of suffering people are experiencing due to the failures of policing in communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">It is not rocket science, but the critical response where crime has been getting out of control around the world has been to introduce community-based policing. We know this from cities like New York, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago. Gardaí need to be taken out of Garda stations and cars to get back in touch with local neighbourhoods. The Garda must sit on those people involved in serious criminal activity to deter children and others who are followers who would drift into trouble if there were no policing. Otherwise, these people will engage in gangsterism and harassment of their neighbours. I raised this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform six or seven times, but he has still not got the message that unless there is a serious change in attitude by him, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and senior gardaí to the value of community policing, we will not address this crisis that bedevils almost every community in the country. The strategic management report on the Garda Síochána, which the Government has not published, specifically addresses the failure of the senior structure in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána to address community policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">My area of Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, is one of the fastest growing communities, not just in Ireland but in the whole of western Europe. We have had an increase in population of 30,000 to the current level of 70,000. The population is greater here than in the cities of Limerick, Galway or Waterford. In 1997, at the end of the rainbow Government, we had 18 community gardaí for a population which was then around the 50,000 mark. In 2004, after all the years of economic growth, the Minister acknowledged in a letter to me that we now have 19 community gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">A beautiful estate of 600 new houses has been built for social and affordable housing. In spite of pleas from people, including me and the county manager, to make policing an integral part of this new housing development, to have a Garda presence in the form of a community garda, neither the Garda Síochána nor the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded. The county manager had to arrange stone picking operations where council workers were employed to go around housing estates to identify potential missiles in the rubble left in the area to prevent windows being broken. This is the usual response when a group of up to 20 young people is asked to move away from a garden wall by a householder putting his or her children to bed. People who are different are also vulnerable; they are targeted by these thugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">People call the Garda in vain. We have fine gardaí in Blanchardstown but very often it appears that if a cow is lost in Cavan, community police are taken there, or to areas such as that of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and Dublin is bereft of any kind of policing.

          <p eId="para_724">The debate gives us an opportunity to review the performance of the Government and, perhaps, to advise it on how it might change direction between now and the end of its term of office. This calls for the re-naming of certain ministries. For instance, there should be a Minister for the shortage of housing or housing waiting lists. There should be a Minister with responsibility for bed waiting lists or overcrowding in hospitals. There should be a Minister for school accommodation shortages, which is a serious issue at present. There should also be a Minister for rising crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Before he left the House, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, made various references to the effect that my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, had accused him of massaging the figures, which he denied. In fact, he has massaged the figures so well he would get a job with most football teams, some of which are being relegated.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">It is evident the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, are completely oblivious to what is going on around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">What worries me most is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regularly condemns rising crime. Instead of making statements about it he should do something. He should initiate steps that would have an impact on the increase in crime. During the recent election campaign he decided to close half the Garda stations. He also intends closing half the prisons. He will obviously let the prisoners out, some of whom are guilty of serious crimes against members of the Garda Síochána. That should resonate with the Minister of State and his senior Minister because the day they do that is the day they relinquish authority to the mandate they received from the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The solemn promises made by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil parties in Government in the past five years are now completely gone. There is a need for another ministry to be set up — the ministry of broken promises. I suggest a significant period of time be given to this because it will be fully occupied for the next two and a half to three years. There will be all the time in the world to examine issues of housing, education, health and justice. To that can be added a plethora of other broken promises made at local level, which include some made by the Minister of State when he referred to opening up the whole county. One would think he was in Idaho a short time ago from the manner in which he was encouraging people to go there from Dublin. Mind you, that process has come unstuck in the interim.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">In spite of all this hooh-hah about increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána, after seven years of performance by that side of the House the number of gardaí in the Carlow-Kildare division has increased by two members. That is truly a monumental performance on the part of the Government after seven years of hard slogging. At the same time it is talking about closing additional Garda stations and prisons. I do not know what else it has in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Between now and the end of its term of office, I hope the Government will examine its collective and individual consciences and ask where it went wrong, why it made such promises, what it was at, what it intended to do and what verdict the people will give on its performance.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_742">On 2 June a group of 25 general practitioners in Drogheda wrote a letter to the Minister for Health and Children about their disquiet at the deterioration in the situation in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The catchment area of the hospital has greatly expanded over the past few years due to a combination of circumstances including the increased population moving into the area, particularly as a result of rising house prices in Dublin; the transfer from other local hospitals in Dundalk, Cavan, Navan and Monaghan, of many of the services; the increase in workload with the arrival of asylum seekers; and the policy of increasing the range and number of specialist services on offer. Matters are at a crisis level in the hospital because of the basic lack of space and facilities to deal with the issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The doctors went on to say that these factors had increased the workload experienced by the hospital. Despite the heroic efforts of their consultant colleagues and all hospital staff, the situation is deteriorating year by year. The patients, consultants, hospital staff and general practitioners are totally frustrated at the inevitable chaos caused by the lack of planning. General practitioners are concerned that in the absence of a plan to either extend the hospital on its current site or to build a new hospital, lives are being put at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">They go on to state that the accident and emergency department is overcrowded and inadequate and dangerous when near full capacity. There is no space for proper X-ray facilities, not enough theatres to service the surgical teams and general practitioners do not have access to basic diagnostic and therapeutic tools such as physiotherapy. For example, urology appointments can take up to four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">The doctors demand a commitment from the Department of Health and Children and I urge the Minister to respond to that demand. He should draw up a plan within the next six months outlining how this intolerable situation in our regional hospital will be addressed. The doctors need clear written proposals as to how the hospital will evolve over the next three years. They want hospital staff, consultants and general practitioners to work together to resolve the issue. The issue is clear. The Minister must act and support the demands of general practitioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">Drogheda hospital is a centre of excellence and its staff are first class in every respect. The Minister and the health board have commissioned a survey on the issue. In response to a parliamentary question I asked today, the Minister replied that the North Eastern Health Board was appointing a design team to prepare a feasibility study for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and that the purpose of the study was to identify the potential for future capital developments at the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">I urge the Minister to ensure that the design team consults not just with the medical people but also with the local authority in Drogheda. Any extra land that needs to be rezoned to extend the hospital will be available. I spoke personally to the town clerk who informed me that the local authority is ready and willing to rezone whatever land is necessary to provide a regional facility, either adjacent to the existing site or within, adjacent to or around the borough of Drogheda.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The expansion of this hospital is important to the people of Drogheda and the region. It is also important that the hospital is not put on wheels and moved somewhere else. It is unsustainable that the hospital would move to a greenfield site in the middle of County Louth or County Meath. This would bring enormous pressure on road infrastructure and on the support services and supplies that would be needed. It is essential that the hospital expands, that it does so in south Louth and that the services so urgently needed are provided by the Government. If not, it will be at the Government's peril. I will make this an election issue for the next general election.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_342">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_749">The general election is some time away yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I welcome the opportunity to clarify a number of issues relating to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. Responsibility for the provision of services at the hospital rests with the North Eastern Health Board. It is a matter for the board to determine the nature and level of service at the hospital, consistent with the board's commitment to the provision of a high-quality, efficient and cost-effective service.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">The board has advised that its strategic objectives for the delivery of acute hospital services in the north-eastern region are derived from a number of regional and local policy initiatives including: a health strategy for the people of the north-east; the proposed development of specialist services in the NEHB from 2001 to 2006; the strategy for capital developments for the acute hospital services from 2001 to 2011; and the report of the regional maternity services review group of 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">These strategies set out the vision for the future direction of acute services in the north-eastern region. This is designed to meet the needs of the population of the region by providing appropriate services at each hospital, which satisfy the necessary criteria relating to each specialty. In summary, this policy networks the five hospital sites into two hospital groups, Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath, with clearly defined roles for each group and site. It aims at expanding the range of specialist services available with a view to attaining regional self-sufficiency for an increasing population.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The overriding objective of this policy is to provide a safe and sustainable acute hospital service. With regard to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, the health board has advised that increases in hospital activity, partly attributable to demographic changes, have posed challenges in recent years. However, it must be emphasised that there have been a number of significant service developments introduced to meet these challenges. These include the appointment of additional consultants in emergency medicine, anaesthetics, haematology, dermatology, cardiology, surgery, orthopaedics and radiology. MRI services have been developed and a new oncology day service has been introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">The health board has also advised that the regional unit for symptomatic breast services and palliative care services has been commissioned in recent weeks on the hospital site. In addition, the Department has approved four new consultant posts in paediatrics and in obstetrics-gynaecology. The board has advised that it is currently in the process of filling these posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">With regard to capital and service developments, a project team comprising representatives of the Department, the North Eastern Health Board and the staff of the hospital has prepared a planning brief for the hospital. In April 2004, the Department approved the appointment of a design team to prepare a site feasibility study which will help to determine future development plans for the hospital. It is planned that this study will be progressed over the coming months and completed by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">In tandem with this overall planning process, a number of interim capital projects are being progressed. A newly refurbished ICU-CCU department will be opened within the next two weeks at a capital cost of approximately €1.3 million. Plans are currently being formulated for the refurbishment of the accident and emergency department, including new radiology equipment, for an upgrade of the catering department and for the provision of a pilot midwifery-led unit at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">While the board accepts that there are some infrastructural deficiencies at the hospital, it is clear that progress is being made on a number of fronts. The North Eastern Health Board and my Department look forward to advancing the overall site feasibility study as well as the various interim capital projects relating to the hospital. The Minister is assured by the North Eastern Health Board of its continuing commitment to the further development of services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and to the provision of high-quality patient care to all of the people of the north-east.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">The Centre for Independent Living, Carmichael House, is located in Brunswick Street. It is home to some 45 organisations, most of which work in the areas of health, social support and information. On account of the funding crisis which has engulfed the centre, it is threatened with imminent closure and 55 members of staff have been issued with redundancy notices.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">I heard the Taoiseach boast again today about the riches of our resources and the economic success that every party which has served in Government has helped to create. It is shameful, therefore, that organisations such as the Centre for Independent Living, Parentline and organisations that specialise in providing advice on diseases such as Crohn's disease should be threatened with having their vital core activities cut back or stopped altogether because this Government refuses to provide core funding to the tune of an additional €150,000. Responsibility for this debacle lies somewhere between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Craggy, whatever it is called. I like to call it Craggy Island; it seems to be headed by a Father Jack-style figure because the Minister does not seem to know what he is doing from one day to the other.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">These vital organisations are threatened with closure. I will cite one example for the Minister of State. For the past ten years, I have been involved in the building up and development of the Centre for Independent Living which is now an all-Ireland organisation offering support to people who have serious illnesses which involve them becoming dependent on wheelchairs. Most of these people are young. The Centre for Independent Living has developed the model of personal assistance which allows such young people — and nowadays, middle-aged and older people — to use a personal assistant and, because they have this vital support, they do not have to live in an institution. Why can this Government, which is rolling in money and which, it is reported today, received an extra €500 million from people who dodged tax, for the sake of €150,000 from the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, not address this crisis?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_348">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_764">I thank Deputy Burton for sharing her time with me. The Carmichael Centre is in my constituency in North Brunswick Street. I have watched this centre grow in size in terms of the services it provides, the number of organisations represented there and its physical size. Only last month, the Taoiseach opened a renovation of the building costing €1.3 million. The main building is a marvellous period building. That seemed to indicate that the Government was prepared to fund the service being provided there. There are 45 voluntary groups working in the centre, as Deputy Burton stated. There are also 350 other groups being serviced by the centre. It provides a significant benefit to the city. The staff have been served with redundancy notices to expire on 9 July and if the centre were to go under, it would be a great loss to the area. It is not possible to contemplate how serious this would be for the variety of organisations which would lose the roof over their heads and would not have the support services provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">The sum of €825,000 as core funding is required to keep the house running on an annual basis. The Department of Health and Children has made some contribution but it is the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that needs to make the commitment. Will the Minister provide the core funding to ensure that the centre can go forward in the years to come and with this insecurity lifted from the heads of both the staff and the organisations represented and serviced by the centre?</p>

            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_766">I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify some matters relating to the provision of funding for the Carmichael Centre, North Brunswick Street, Dublin. Like the Deputies opposite, I am well aware of the important work which is conducted at this centre by many different organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">The provision of health-related services for people with disabilities, physical, sensory or intellectual, and for those with autism is a matter of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Since 1997, the Department has allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector which has resulted in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health-related services which are being provided to people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The Carmichael Centre is Ireland's largest centre for voluntary organisations, providing accommodation for 43 small voluntary organisations working in the area of health, social services, community and art. By small I do not mean small in the scope of their contribution to our life. The centre provides a large range of services enabling voluntary organisations to achieve their objectives in a cost-efficient manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided for the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include residential, respite, home support, personal assistance, therapy and day care services. An additional €25 million in current expenditure was made available by the Minister for Finance in the 2004 budget for services for people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">The sum of €250,000 was allocated in 2002 by the Department of Health and Children for the refurbishment of the Carmichael Centre. This grant was made in recognition of the fact that the centre includes among its clients a number of organisations active in the health field. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, also has a role in supporting this centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The Department of Health and Children has been in contact with the management of the Carmichael Centre in recent days to confirm that it will allocate funding to help the centre to continue to provide an excellent service.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_775">I have tabled this question because there is great concern in Tallaght about the situation in Tallaght hospital. At one stage there were 45 people on trolleys and chairs in the hospital. I do not believe that the staff, local politicians and local residents know what is happening there. The first sight in the accident and emergency department is people on trolleys and the number is unacceptably high.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">A friend of mine has a congenital heart problem. He was brought to the hospital which at that time had 18 people accommodated in the corridor. He saw an elderly woman surrounded by her family. I do not know if the woman died or not but people were very upset. Children attending the hospital's accident and emergency department must pass by. My friend, who was wired up to an ECG machine, left his bed to use the toilet. When he returned, his bed was gone. I hear these stories from people.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The son of another friend of mine had meningitis. He recognised the signs, rang the hospital and was told by an administrator to bring the person to the hospital immediately. He asked whether he should bring his son to the local doctor but he was told to go to the hospital. That patient was waiting to be treated for between four and five hours. As it happened, the type of meningitis was not contagious, but this incident highlights the situation in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">I do not know if the Minister of State is working from a script. I have a script with me but I am not working from it. People want to know if it is a case of a lack of investment in the hospital or a lack of staff and they want to know what the problems are. It is becoming worse. The Irish Nurses' Organisation says it has never been so bad and the same applies in other hospitals in Dublin. People need answers. If it is a problem with money or a lack of investment, we are in a time of plenty and there are reports today of receipts of €500 million. People do not understand.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Tallaght hospital was created by an amalgamation of a number of hospitals. It was a stop-start hospital and many sods were turned before it was built. People had great expectations that this hospital would fulfil all the local needs, not only of Tallaght but of the surrounding areas, but it has not done so.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">A woman told me of her child who has severe arthritis. The child was two weeks in hospital waiting to be seen by a rheumatologist because the hospital does not have a consultant rheumatologist. The main problem seems to be a blockage in the system. I do not know if it is due to the lack of step-down beds. There are many reasons but people in the area need to know what is happening in the accident and emergency department. Sometimes there may be four patients and two nurses in the observation ward with perhaps 80 people on chairs, trolleys or beds. It is beyond belief.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">My friend was in the hospital on a week night. One would expect an increase in attendance at the weekend but the problem also occurs during the week. I am not criticising staff at the hospital who I accept are doing their best. People are asking whether the problem lies with the administration and management of the hospital or the lack of funding. We do not know the answer and I ask the Minister of State to provide one. I do not want to hear the script.</p>

            <p eId="para_782">I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Deputy Crowe will be aware that services at the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The authority has advised the Minister that the emergency department at Tallaght Hospital has been experiencing pressure on its services which has resulted in delays for patients awaiting admission to hospital. That is acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">Activity in the hospital is driven predominantly by emergency admissions as 74% of all admissions are through the emergency department. While there was a peak of 45 patients awaiting admission in the emergency department on 8 June, which was the figure to which the Deputy referred, the position has improved on a daily basis since then. The authority has reported that ten patients were awaiting admission in the emergency department yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The authority has been liaising closely with the hospital regarding the ongoing pressures in the emergency department. Well-developed procedures are in place in the hospital to manage beds as efficiently as possible. Daily bed management meetings are held with key stake holders to deal with all issues relating to admissions and discharges of patients in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">A contributing factor to the delays being experienced by patients awaiting admission is the number of patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment and continue to occupy an acute bed. The authority has reported that on 6 June, 38 elderly patients and 18 young chronically ill patients in the hospital had been deemed fit for discharge but continued to occupy an acute bed. To address the problem, an €8.8 million package was provided by the Minister for Health and Children to the authority to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting, thus freeing up acute beds. To date, more than 40 patients in Tallaght Hospital have benefited from this initiative and arrangements are being made for further discharges in the weeks ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">In addition, the authority commissioned a joint initiative in 2003 between the South Western Area Health Board and the hospital to implement a multi-disciplinary programme designed to provide individual programmes of care, which would enable patients to be discharged with appropriate support to the community. To date, 17 patients have been discharged under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine or accident and emergency departments reflect system wide issues. I will outline some of the key actions the Minister for Health and Children has taken in that regard. I have already spoken about the number of patients in acute hospital beds who have completed their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that some 250 patients have been discharged from acute hospitals in the region as a direct result of the funding provided by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">The Minister has also provided additional funding for recruitment of additional emergency medicine consultants and consultant anaesthetists. To date, 20 additional emergency medicine consultants have been recruited. Further appointments are being progressed by the health boards and the ERHA. The availability of senior medical staff in emergency medicine departments should facilitate rapid clinical decision making and enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">Emergency medicine departments sometimes have to deal with injuries and conditions more appropriate to a primary care setting. Government support for the development of general practitioner out of hours co-operatives nationally for the period 1997 to 2003 amounted to €46.5 million. In time, these co-operatives can be developed to provide a much wider range of services to ensure that communities enjoy appropriate access to primary care services, irrespective of size and distance from major urban centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">I understand the authority is continuing to actively monitor the situation and is working with hospitals and the area health boards to ensure every effort is made to minimise waiting time for patients being admitted through emergency departments of acute hospitals in the region.</p>

          <heading>Rural Transport Services.</heading>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_355">
            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_791">Slightly more than a year ago, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, launched the west Sligo rural transport initiative in Dromore West. The project has grown from strength to strength with a total of 14 scheduled services in the rural electoral area of west Sligo and the south Sligo areas of Gurteen, Ballymote, Banada, Tourlestrane and Tubbercurry.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">The working group is very proud of its achievements. The service now carries more than 800 passengers a month and more than 5,700 passengers availed of the service in 2003. It is alarming that the service is due to be cancelled as a result of the decision to reduce the allocation of €88,000 secured in 2003. The service is facing a deficit of €36,000 in funding for 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Millions of euros went into the coffers today as a result of massive tax returns. This rural transport service, launched by the Minister and carrying 800 passengers per month, is regarded as a godsend by hundreds of elderly people in remote parts of County Sligo. It is the first time they have been able to use their free travel passes. There is no point giving out free passes if the people concerned cannot avail of public transport. Under this scheme, people are picked up, taken to the adjacent town and returned to their doors twice each week. This has had a considerable impact on their quality of life. According to one user of the service, the service is personal, 100% accessible and not only benefits the passenger but gives respite to carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">Just €36,000 would fund a service availed of by 800 passengers a month but the refusal to provide the additional funds will lead to the service being cancelled. Something is wrong if this can happen in an economy which received an additional €500 million in its coffers today. I am aware, from my role as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, of the many ways in which taxpayers money is spent. This service provides extraordinary value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">I received a letter today from the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Ms Julie O'Neill, which stated: "I regret to say that in the current year the Department has no additional funds for the scheme." I do not accept that reply. I hope the Minister of State will give me some indication as to how the €36,000 required will be found. I call on Dr. Tony Crooks, chief executive officer of ADM, which is responsible for the distribution of funding secured from the Department for rural transport, to ensure, with the Minister, that the required sum is found. There is no way the service can be allowed to finish at the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Just this time last year, the Minister visited Sligo and had his photograph taken in a bus to launch the service. We need integrity in public office. I attended a public meeting attended by up to 100 people in support of this service. This service is of major benefit and offers opportunities to elderly people, the most disadvantaged in society who avail of the free travel pass. What has gone wrong that we cannot find €36,000?</p>
            <p eId="para_797">While I am not casting any aspersions on the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I am very disappointed the Minister for Transport is not present. It is unfair of him to send the Minister of State to the House. I hope he has not been given a dud reply. I ask him to return to the Minister and ask him to contact Dr. Tony Crooks, empowering him to give the necessary funds to Mr. Michael Quigley of the west Sligo rural transport initiative to continue the service. The money must be found. If I have to bring people from west and south Sligo to the gates of Leinster House next week to get the money, I will do so. If the Minister of State does not have an adequate reply this evening, the Minister of Transport will be given a clear message next week when I come to Leinster House that the €36,000 required to continue the transport service provided in the areas of Ballymote, Banada, Tourlestrane and Tubbercurry, Dromore West and Enniscrone must be found. I will not take "No" for an answer on this issue.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_356" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_798">I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. I fear I may meet the Deputy at the gates of Leinster House.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">Area Development Management Limited is managing the pilot rural transport initiative, RTI, on behalf of the Department of Transport. The RTI provides funding on a pilot basis for 34 community organisations and community partnerships around the country to address the transport needs of their areas by the provision of transport services. A sum of €3 million was provided annually by the Department of Transport for the initiative in the two year period ending December 2003 and further funding of €3 million is being provided in 2004. This €9 million commitment compares with €4.4 million earmarked for the RTI in the national development plan. The RTI is operational in virtually all counties with 2,500 transport services being provided on approximately 380 new rural routes established under the initiative. A total of 20,000 people are using the RTI transport services every month.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">ADM Limited advises that for a variety of reasons very few of the RTI pilot projects were able to commence transport operations in 2002. While funding of €3 million was made available that year, expenditure on the RTI in 2002 was slow. However, the position changed considerably in 2003 as the projects began transport services. By the end of the year all 34 RTI groups, including the west Sligo rural transport initiative, had become operational and many of the projects had expanded their services significantly from those originally proposed for the 2003 funding allocations. In addition, the free travel scheme of the Department of Social and Family Affairs was extended to the RTI in 2003 and €400,000 was provided for that purpose in that year. In contrast to 2002, practically all of the available funding for the RTI in 2003 was expended during that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">It is understood from ADM Limited that the annualised RTI funding allocation for the years 2002 and 2003 for the west Sligo rural transport initiative was €40,000 in addition to a once-off grant of €6,349 to facilitate some pre-development work. However, only a minimal amount of this funding was expended in 2002 because the project was not in a position to roll out its services in that year. This resulted in a disproportionate amount of the funding, €80,000, being concentrated on one year, 2003. In addition, the company also received €6,880 from the allocation for the free travel scheme in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">ADM Limited advises that, while the original 2004 RTI allocation for the west Sligo rural transport initiative was €49,594, this was supplemented by a further allocation of €2,920 in April this year arising from the distribution of a small amount of RTI funds which had been withheld by ADM Limited at the beginning of the year to cater for unexpected occurrences. It is understood that the west Sligo rural transport initiative will also benefit this year from funding being provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arising from application of the free travel scheme to the RTI. The project might also acquire funding from other sources. It is understood that, in some cases, RTI schemes have been able to generate additional funds from statutory bodies such as health boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">While the Department of Transport provides the overall funding for the RTI, ADM Limited is responsible for the specific allocations to individual project groups. The Department has been in contact with ADM Limited with regard to the current difficulties of the west Sligo rural transport initiative. ADM Limited advises that its chief executive officer is in contact with the chief executive officer of the west Sligo rural transport initiative with regard to the project's financial position.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">There is every indication that the rural transport initiative has, so far, been an excellent success and ADM Limited is concluding a comprehensive appraisal of the effectiveness of the overall scheme. When this is completed, the Minister for Transport will then consider the rural transport position and the funding of rural transport projects generally in the light of findings of the appraisal. However, he regrets that in the current year his Department has no additional funds for the RTI other than the €3 million provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_806">In addition to satisfying the relevant contribution conditions, those applying for retirement pension at age 65 must be retired from employment or self employment. Retirement is defined as not having earnings from employment of more than €38 per week or earnings from self-employment of more than €3,174 per annum. There is no retirement condition associated with old age contributory or non-contributory pensions which are both payable at 66 years of age. The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to bridge the gap between retirement at 65 and the pension age for social welfare purposes, which at the time was 70 years of age. The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years of age but the requirement to retire before receiving a retirement pension has remained in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">It is important in the context of the demographic changes our society will face in the years ahead that we should encourage and facilitate people who wish to extend their working lives to remain active.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">The Government is committed, as part of the programme for Government, to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension. Progress in this regard will be made as soon as possible, having regard to the availability of resources and other priorities.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_811">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">The Family Support Agency which I established on 6 May 2003 brings together pro-family programmes and services introduced by the Government in recent years which are designed to promote local family support, help prevent marital breakdown, promote continuity and stability in family life and support ongoing parenting relationships for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">The agency provides a direct, nationwide family mediation service and, through funding, supports, promotes and develops the provision of marriage and relationship counselling, other family supports and the family and community services resource centre programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">The agency has a responsibility to undertake or commission research, to advise, inform and assist me as Minister for Social and Family Affairs and to promote and disseminate information about family-related issues. I believe that the board have both the necessary experience and expertise to steer the agency through its important first years.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The publication of the Family Support Agency strategic plan which I launched last month reinforces this belief. In clear and concise terms it spells out the agency's priorities for the next three years. These set out to: support and strengthen families; foster a supportive community environment for families; undertake or commission research into family related matters; promote the agency as a key provider of support services and information to families; and recognise the role played by the agency's staff and continue to invest in their development.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">I am satisfied with and fully support the priorities chosen by the board of the agency and consider they have put an effective strategy in place to successfully deliver on these priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">For my part I have this year, 2004, made over €20 million available to the agency to fulfil its functions. Over €7 million of this is for the scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage and relationship counselling and other family supports. For the current year, this will mean financial support to more than 500 groups throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">The year 2004 also sees the continued development of the family and community resource centre programme. In just 12 months from the establishment of the Family Support Agency, 18 new family resource centres have been approved for inclusion in the programme and 12 of these are already up and running. The agency has been given investment of €8.39 million in 2004 to drive forward this important programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">I also welcome and fully support the priority being given to the continued expansion of the family mediation service. During 2003, new centres opened in Sligo and Waterford, bringing to 14 the number of offices now operating nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">I am happy to say that two more centres are planned for this year — in Letterkenny, to ensure effective access to the service in the north-west, and in Portlaoise, to similarly expand the service in the midlands. A major family research programme is being completed with the publication later this year of the final studies commissioned under the programme. The consultation process on family issues, which I undertook last year, together with the findings of the Irish Presidency conference and the OECD study on reconciling work and family life, in which Ireland participated, have provided a wide range of material on the future direction of policies to support families. These will be fully taken into account, together with the board's strategic plan, in drawing up the strategy on supports for families currently being prepared for publication by year end. This strategy should also greatly assist the board in setting its research priorities for the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">I would like to compliment the dedication and professionalism of the board, its chief executive officer and staff. I am confident that the services provided by the agency in accordance with this strategic plan, will be of a high standard. Given the resources put at their disposal, I am confident the board will meet the strategic priorities laid down in the plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_824">I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 84 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">Data compiled by the Central Statistics Office on pensions coverage have indicated that just over 50% of workers have supplementary pensions cover. The Government aims to increase this to 70% in accordance with the targets suggested in the national pensions policy initiative, and I am aware that this is an ambitious target.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">The overall objective of the Government's pension policy is that all citizens will have an adequate income on retirement — the main components being the social welfare pension and supplementary pensions, either on an occupational or personal basis. In this regard, the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 provided for the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, which became available to the public in 2003. The PRSA is a low cost, flexible pensions product which is the main instrument employed in furtherance of Government policy to increase supplementary pensions coverage. Take-up of the new accounts is being monitored closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">In addition, a national pensions awareness campaign is being run by the Pensions Board on the behalf of the Government to encourage people to consider their requirements for retirement and to make the necessary provision as early as possible. In this regard €500,000 was provided for the campaign in each year for 2003 and 2004. The view of all participants in the national pension policy initiative was that the current voluntary approach to supplementary pensions should not be changed at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">The Government is required, under the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, to review progress in relation to the level of pension coverage by September 2006. If, at that stage, I am not happy with the progress being made in pursuit of our objectives on supplementary pensions coverage, other measures will have to be considered, which would include an examination of some form of mandatory cover. In this regard I welcome the suggestions made by the Irish Insurance Federation at their recent conference on "Closing the Irish Savings Gap". The federation, whom I met, has made a number of interesting and imaginative suggestions, including the creation of pension funds for children, on how people can be encouraged to save for their retirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">At our meeting, I suggested that the IIF should pursue their proposal further and might wish to submit it for consideration to the Pensions Board, which is a representative body and has a statutory role to advise me on pensions policy.</p>

     <b>Mr. McCormack</b>
      asked the

     her views on the current level of uptake for the farm assist scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_831">The farm assist scheme, which introduced special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act 1999 and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999. There are now 8,690 farm assist customers. The current average weekly payment is €142.59.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The farm assist scheme is a practical response by my Department to the situation of low income farmers and it represents a long-term safety net for them. It benefits farm families with children and also provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">The level of take-up is less than had been anticipated when the scheme was first introduced in April, 1999. One of the factors impacting on the take-up of the scheme is the significant increase in off-farm employment in recent years. However, the benefits to those who have joined it have been significant. The scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children and it makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">To increase awareness of the farm assist scheme, my Department undertook a major publicity campaign in 2002. Almost €100,000 was spent on that campaign which included radio and press advertising, including specialist farming publications, and the production and showing around the country of a promotional video on the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">More generally, the network of social welfare offices throughout the country provides information to members of the public on the range of schemes and services available, including the farm assist scheme. Information leaflets and applications forms for farm assist are available at these offices.

            <p eId="para_837">Sustaining Progress contains a number of important commitments in relation to social welfare payments, including commitments: to increase social welfare pensions over a five to 10 year period to 34% of average industrial earnings, in line with the recommendations of the national pensions policy initiative; to increase the level of social welfare pension to reach a target level of €200 by 2007 in line with the commitment in the programme for Government; to make progress to increase the level of qualified adult allowance for pensioner spouses to the level of the old age (non-contributory) pension; and to meet the target for the lowest social welfare rates and appropriate child equivalence levels as set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy by 2007, namely, to increase the lowest rate of social welfare payments to €150, in 2002 terms, by 2007 and to achieve equivalence levels of child income support of between 33% and 35% of the personal rate of payment. The level of increases in payments since this Government came into office in 1997 demonstrates the commitment that we have to providing significant real improvements for social welfare recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">The real value of payments has been progressively increased over that period. Long-term payments for a couple without children have risen by 60% since 1997 while short-term payments for a couple without children have risen by over 52%.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">The level of child income support has also increased considerably in recent years. The social welfare payment of a couple on a short-term payment with two children has risen by 59.5%, way ahead of inflation which increased by 24.6% over the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">Most recently the 2004 budget package cost €630 million and enabled the provision of increases well ahead of inflation for all social welfare recipients of weekly payments as well as significant other improvements in social welfare provisions generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">As I said in the House at the time of the budget, the underlying objective was to make progress towards the achievement of the various commitments including the commitment on the lowest rate of payment. Further progress will be made towards delivering on these commitments in future budgets.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">During the Irish Presidency, my focus, and that of my Department has been to advance the EU social policy agenda generally and, in particular, to make progress in realising the ten-year goals set by the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">One of the goals of the Lisbon agenda is to achieve greater social cohesion. Based on an analysis of the second round national action plans on social inclusion 2003-2005, a report on employment, social protection/inclusion and gender equality was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March and reflected in a key messages paper to the Spring European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">The four key social protection/inclusion messages relate to strengthening social inclusion, making work pay, which was the subject of a special ministerial meeting in January, ensuring that pension systems support longer working lives, and ensuring accessibility, sustainability and quality of health care and long-term care for the elderly.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">One of the priorities of the Irish Presidency was to secure agreement with the European Parliament on the reform and simplification of regulation 1408/71 which co-ordinates the social security rights of migrant workers, and members of their families, when they move within the Union. I am very pleased that, following acceptance by the European Parliament and the Council the new regulation was adopted on 29 April last. In addition, I hosted a special conference in Budapest on 7 and 8 May, in co-operation with the Hungarian Government and the Commission which addressed both the future implications of the new simplified regulation for all 25 states and the particular immediate challenges facing new member states in implementing the existing regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The issue of migration has also been a priority for my Department during the Irish Presidency. On 1 and 2 April we hosted a conference on the theme of "Reconciling Mobility and Social Inclusion". The main focus of the conference was on the role of social and employment policies in achieving social inclusion for people moving within the EU and it concluded that clear and comprehensive strategies are required at national level to promote employment and social inclusion of immigrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">In the area of family policy and to mark the 10th anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family, the Irish Presidency hosted a major international conference on the theme "Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe". One of the key conclusions was that addressing the challenges posed by the profound changes affecting families requires at national level a strategic, integrated approach involving employment, social protection and possibly other policy areas, such as education, health and housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">The Irish Presidency also progressed an initiative taken by previous Presidencies by hosting a third meeting of people experiencing poverty in Brussels at the end of May. One of the key messages to emerge was that effective participation by people experiencing poverty is taking place and is being developed across all member states to help make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and achieve greater social cohesion.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">At the last meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, I updated my EU colleagues on the key conclusions of the various conferences. In my view the successful outcome of this ambitious programme represents a significant contribution to advancing the EU social policy agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_853">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">Access to social assistance and child benefit payments has been restricted since 1 May 2004 by the introduction of a new eligibility requirement, known as the habitual residence condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">The new condition is designed to safeguard the social welfare system by restricting access to social assistance and child benefit payments for people from other countries who have little or no connection with Ireland. All persons claiming welfare payments, including nationals of the new EU member states who applied for rent supplement after 1 May, are subject to the habitual residence condition. People who fail to satisfy the habitual residence condition are offered the option of being referred to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who facilitate their departure home and provide full board accommodation pending departure.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">The immigration status of asylum seekers from the new EU member states has been underwritten by EU treaty rights from 1 May 2004 and they now have full access to the Irish labour market. In this context, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform requested new EU member state nationals in direct provision centres to seek alternative accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">However, they are being given ample opportunity to secure alternative accommodation before leaving direct provision. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has assured my Department that nobody from a new EU member state has been compelled to leave direct provision without there being an alternative accommodation option available to that person. Asylum seekers who are accommodated in direct provision centres have all of their basic needs, including the needs of their children, provided for within the direct provision system.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">Asylum seekers in direct provision are also paid a weekly allowance of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 in respect of each child dependant. In addition, an asylum seeker can also apply to a health board for a single payment of supplementary welfare allowance to meet an exceptional need. These payments are generally made for the purchase of clothing and are not subject to the habitual residence condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">My Department asked each health board to furnish data on the number of applications for supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement, which have been refused on habitual residence grounds. Six boards have responded so far and they report that some 68 applications were refused on habitual residence grounds during the month of May. This includes nationals of the accession states as well as nationals of other countries. A more detailed breakdown is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">I am satisfied that the introduction of the habitual residence condition will not adversely affect asylum seekers in the direct provision system.</p>

            <p eId="para_862">The back-to-work allowance scheme which was introduced in September 1993 is part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to assist long-term unemployed people, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force. There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work enterprise allowance for self-employment and the back to work allowance for employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">The allowance was introduced at a time when long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. In its early years the scheme proved very effective in helping people who had been long-term unemployed to return to the labour force. However, changes in labour market conditions since the mid-1990s have reduced the need for the scheme. This is illustrated by the drop in numbers availing of it in recent years. At present, there are 14,060 participants in the scheme, compared to 39,343 in October 2000 when the scheme reached its peak.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">The scheme was reviewed in 2002 in light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the scheme in 1993. This review also took account of an evaluation of the scheme by independent consultants. They recommended that the scheme should be restructured in light of the changes in the labour market. In particular, the review recommended that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">In January 2003, therefore, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit-assistance was increased to five years. Recipients of other social welfare qualifying payments were not affected by the change. The scheme is continually monitored to ensure its relevance to current labour market and economic conditions. I recognised that there was some difficulty being experienced by persons wishing to enter self-employment after five years' attachment to the live register. I announced in budget 2004 that the qualifying period for access to the self-employed strand of the scheme would be reduced to three years for those in receipt of an unemployment payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Effectively from March 2004 persons in receipt of unemployment benefit-assistance accessing the self-employed strand of the scheme only require three years on their payment to qualify for participation in the scheme. I will continue to monitor the scheme but I have no immediate plans to change the existing qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">The supplementary welfare scheme was selected for review in my Department's series of expenditure reviews largely because of the increasing numbers of recipients on the scheme, the consequent rise in expenditure and the range of changes being proposed in relation to individual aspects of the scheme. The review is being carried out by an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department and is comprised of representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The review involves a fundamental appraisal of the scheme in which all of its aspects are being examined with the aim of improving customer service and administrative efficiency. The review also provides an opportunity to address the role of the health boards' community welfare service generally in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The working group carried out an extensive consultation process. This resulted in 145 submissions being received by the working group. More than 700 issues were raised in these submissions covering some 18 broad themes. Due to the number and nature of the issues raised, the working group has decided to draw up an interim report. This is being drafted and I hope to receive it shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">As the Deputy is aware, I am devoting a considerable amount of effort to reform of the rent supplement element of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. In recognition of the fact that rent supplements had become in effect a scheme of long-term housing support for many people, the Government set up a planning group to rationalise current arrangements for housing support. Our objective is to ensure that long-term housing needs are addressed by providing appropriate solutions rather than through the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">Arising from the work of this group, an action plan is now being finalised. The action plan will include criteria for determining which categories of rent supplement recipient will be eligible to have their needs addressed by the housing authorities, an implementation timescale, financing arrangements and other matters. Discussions between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard are at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_875">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 104 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The recently published study entitled Food Poverty and Policy is an informative and challenging piece of research and will add considerably to awareness of this issue. The study focuses on the relationship between patterns of food consumption, socio-economic circumstance, and issues of affordability and access to food.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">In seeking to quantify the extent of food poverty in Ireland, the study draws on earlier research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute. It notes that a high proportion of those living in consistent poverty experienced deprivation in relation to the three food related basic deprivation indicators. However, the proportion of individuals going without each item declined significantly between 1994 and 2001, reflecting the fall in consistent poverty generally, which is down from 15.1% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">The study found that socially disadvantaged people: eat less well compared to those from socially advantaged groups; spend relatively more money on food; have difficulty accessing a variety of nutritionally balanced good quality and affordable foodstuffs; and are restricted by a combination of factors, including their dependants, personal preferences, access to shops and financial limitations, in maintaining a healthy diet.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">The study recognises the crucial importance of school meals' provision in addressing food poverty among children. The school meals programme operated by my Department makes an important contribution to ensuring that school children receive better nutrition and contributes to improved school attendance and quality of learning. The current programme provides funding for the urban school meals scheme, which operates in conjunction with certain local authorities, as well as for a number of locally operated school meals projects in place in both urban and rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">In 2003, €3.29 million was spent on the school meals programme. It is estimated that 382 schools, with a total of more than 50,650 pupils benefited from the urban scheme, while 347 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which benefited approximately 26,000 children under local school meals projects. Budget 2004 provided €6.08 million for the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">My Department is working with the Department of Education and Science to extend the school meals programme. In this regard the Department of Education and Science is using its schools completion programme and Giving Children an Even Break initiative to target disadvantaged schools. It is actively promoting the school meals programme through the local schools completion programme co-ordinators.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The range of recommendations advanced in the Food Poverty and Policy study will be carefully considered both by my Department and by other relevant Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">The Central Statistics Office, CSO, included a question in the 2002 census to identify the number of persons providing unpaid personal care for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability. The analysis of this portion of the census found that: 40,500 people provide 43 hours or more unpaid personal help per week, or more than six hours per day; 23,400 people provide 15 to 42 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between two and six hours per day; and 84,900 people provide one to 14 hours unpaid personal help per week, or up to two hours per day.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">There are currently approximately 22,000 carers in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit. This means that more than 50% of the 40,500 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than six hours per day, are in receipt of a specific carer's payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, people providing lower levels of care would not necessarily meet all the qualifying conditions for receipt of a carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The primary objective of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. In line with other social assistance schemes, the means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test applied to the allowance has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of spouses' earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">In April 2004 the weekly income disregards increased to €250 for a single carer and to €500 for a couple. The effect of this increase will, for example, ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to €29,328 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while the same couple, if they had an income of €46,384 could still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">As average industrial earnings in December 2003 were approximately €29,100 per annum, good progress is being made towards the commitment in the Programme for Government that all persons on average industrial earnings will be able to qualify for the carer's allowance. The complete abolition of the means test would have substantial cost implications. It is estimated that abolition of the means test could cost in the region of €180 million per annum. It is debatable whether this could be considered to be the best use of resources. The views of some support and health organisations is that if resources of this scale were available, it would be more beneficial to carers to invest in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">While matters relating to the nursing home subvention are the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, I will say that, while the abolition of the carer's allowance means test might have some impact on recourse to the nursing home subvention, it would not reduce the overall cost of care. Research suggests that community care can be as costly, if not more so, than institutional care where a proper and adequate range of community services are provided. Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to the people involved.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 118 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">Fraud against the social welfare system arises in a number of different ways. In some instances persons claiming social welfare payments make false declarations or conceal material facts in order to obtain payment. In other cases there is deliberate failure to notify the Department of a change in circumstances or failure by an employer to comply with PRSI regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">The control strategy of my Department which was revised in 2003 provides for a three-pronged approach to control: prevention — having systems and procedures in place that prevent and minimise the risk of incorrect payments, fraud and abuse; detection — detecting incorrect payments, fraud and abuse of schemes and unpaid PRSI contributions by employers and the self-employed at the earliest possible stage; and deterrence — ensuring that the public are aware of the risks and penalties of defrauding the social welfare system and dealing decisively with cases of fraud and abuse detected, including prosecutions where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">This strategy entails the use of a mix of measures to control fraud and abuse. These include desk review of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mailshots to selected claimants, database checking and employer inspections and medical reviews in the case of illness payments. The detection of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department. The work of all staff who are engaged in any aspect of claims processing is to some degree concerned with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">There are some 600 staff at local, regional and national level whose work is entirely or significantly related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. Some 300 of these are responsible for routine investigations under the various schemes and for reporting on and following up suspected cases of fraud where they are discovered. As a result of control activities carried out by these staff, savings of €851 million were achieved during the years 2001, 2002 and 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications of a change in circumstances, which may not have been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors. Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are also checked on an ongoing basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment. The Department also has a programme of employer inspections to ensure compliance with the provisions relating to PRSI.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The control programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective. The total amount of overpayments set up as a result of detected fraud or suspected fraud for the years in question was €11 million in 2001, €11.8 million in 2002 and €13.7 million in 2003. The payments most subjected to fraud for these years were those paid to unemployment recipients which accounted for €6.4 million — 58% — in 2001; €8.1 million — 69% — in 2002; and €9.7 million — 71% — in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">It is my Department's policy to seek recovery of all moneys incorrectly paid and every effort is made to recover overpayments in full, having regard to the provisions of a code of practice which is in place to regulate this process. Overpayments which result from fraud are given greatest priority and their recovery is vigorously pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">Plans are being put in place for a new central overpayments and debt management system within my Department. When fully operational, this will provide a facility to enhance the targeting of control work, make overpayment recovery more effective and provide better and more up to date information on the main types of fraud occurring within the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">My Department's policy is to consider all cases of fraud for prosecution and revised prosecution guidelines were issued to staff in February 2003. The issue of these guidelines has had a significant impact on the number of cases submitted to the Chief State Solicitor's office to initiate prosecutions during the period in question — 177 in 2001; 245 in 2002 and 405 in 2003. Current trends indicate that there will be some 600 such cases in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them and that they are delivered in an effective and efficient way. I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected and I will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve this.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_369">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_912">The recently published ESRI report, Work-poor Households: The Welfare Implications of Changing Household Employment Patterns, examines how the employment situation of working age Irish households has changed over a period of remarkable economic and employment growth between 1994 and 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">The report found that households where none of the adults of working age 18 to 64 years were working fell from 22% in 1994 to less than 14% in 2000. The rate of work poor households, which was one of the highest in the EU in 1985, fell to the EU average by 2000. The report showed that the decline in joblessness was particularly strong among households with children. In 1994, 27% of children lived in jobless households, but this fell to 9% in 2000. This is a particularly positive development in the context of the Government's objective of reducing child poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">Those households shown to be at particular risk of joblessness were the households of older people aged 55 to 64 years, lone parents, those with a chronic health problem or disability, those without qualifications and those with a history of unskilled work. These types of household were also more likely to be persistently work poor, that is, to have no one in employment for three or more years.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">The report highlights the importance of employment as a route out of poverty and the significant progress which has been made in this regard. It also highlights the central role of poor educational outcomes in increasing vulnerability to household joblessness. Improving access to and completion of formal education is thus a key policy tool in preventing households becoming work poor.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">The proportion of work poor households headed up by lone parents fell from 70% of such households in 1997 to 41% in 2000. The report does, however, raise concerns about the quality and long-term sustainability of some forms of lone parent employment. Of households where the reference person was disabled or chronically ill, 60% were found to be persistently work poor. Sickness or disability benefits accounted for the biggest share of welfare income among work poor households in 2000. The study notes that the disabled and chronically ill can face a number of barriers to participation in the labour market and reinforces the need for these barriers to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The report will be of particular value in the ongoing development of the Government's anti-poverty strategy and in focusing attention on the needs of those categories of households most likely to have no one in work.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_919">An essential element of the effective delivery of the social welfare schemes and services for which my Department is responsible is the provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner. The objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements across all social welfare schemes and supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">My Department directs information to citizens on new schemes and services through advertising, using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, and through information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. All our schemes and services are publicised on our website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i> Selective use is also made of free-phone telephone services to provide information on new schemes and services and at particular times of the year, such as budget time.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">As regards information products, my Department produces a comprehensive range of information booklets covering each social welfare payment. These are widely available from the network of 130 social welfare local offices and branch offices throughout the country as well as from citizen's information centres and many local organisations. Information is also available from information officers located in social welfare local offices who give talks to many groups and organisations and attend exhibitions and seminars.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">My Department also works closely with voluntary and community organisations involved in an information giving role. A number of such organisations receive funding on an annual basis towards the cost of providing welfare rights and information services for their target groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Consultation with our customers is another route towards understanding their needs and expectations. We use a range of methods such as customer panels, customer surveys and comment cards. The findings of our customer surveys are, in the main, very positive and show a high overall satisfaction rating with the services provided, including information provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">I should also refer to the work of Comhairle which is the national information agency coming under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information, advice and other supports to all citizens, including those with disabilities. Comhairle supports a network of some 85 citizen's information centres whose role is to provide information to members of the public on the full range of social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">As regards upcoming promotional campaigns, my Department is planning later this year to promote the role of our social welfare local offices as key information contact points in disseminating information on social welfare entitlements across all age groups. In addition, we plan to undertake an information campaign designed to promote carer's benefit for insured workers who leave work to care for persons in need of full-time care and attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">The primary purpose of advertising by my Department is to reach the relevant target audience and I am satisfied that that objective is generally met. In so far as is possible, surveys are undertaken to assess the impact of advertising campaigns in terms of scheme uptake and the results are generally positive. For example, a survey undertaken following an extensive campaign promoting the personal public services number in 2003 year showed an awareness level of 82% compared with a corresponding level of the order of 15% from a 2001 survey.</p>

            <p eId="para_928">I welcome the new stage in the development of this organisation, formerly known as Cherish and now renamed One Family, which has been providing, very effectively, support and empowerment for one-parent families for more than 30 years. Its overall aim now is to affect positive change and achieve equality and social inclusion for all one-parent families. Its strategic plan for 2004-06 sets out how it plans to achieve that aim through helping all one-parent families in providing for their basic needs, advancing their rights and working to affect positive change.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">Prior to the release of the plan I met with the director of One Family and discussed with her the goals set out in the plan. I share the commitment of One Family to achieving equality and social inclusion for one-parent families. Its position and proposals will be fully taken into account in the strategy on supports for families being prepared for issue before end year, and in the ongoing context of the national anti-poverty strategy, given the vulnerability of this group to poverty and social exclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">Employment is the best route out of poverty. Reconciling work and family life is a major problem for one parent families. Priority will be given to further developing the supports given to lone parents who opt to work outside the home in enabling them to meet both the demands of work and care for family.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">One Family offers a comprehensive range of professional services to one parent families, those experiencing a crisis pregnancy and those working with one parent families. I was pleased to be in a position to approve a grant of €4,000 this year under the scheme of grants for marriage and relationship counselling to assist in increasing its current capacity and the accessibility of its counselling services. I look forward to working with the organisation in light of its strategic plan on both policy development and improved service provision, and towards meeting their aims for one parent families of greater equality and social inclusion brought about by positive change.</p>

            <p eId="para_937">At the end of May 2004, there were 202,710 people receiving an old age contributory or retirement pension and 85,877 receiving an old age non-contributory pension. An actuarial review of the social insurance fund, undertaken on behalf of my Department in 2002, projected that the number of recipients of old age contributory and retirement pensions will increase to 255,000 by 2011 and 321,000 by 2016. The increase will, to some extent, be balanced by a reduction in the number of people receiving an old age non-contributory pension. The numbers receiving this pension have declined by more than 20% in the last ten years, which reflects improved social insurance coverage and increased labour force participation, particularly among women.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">In common with other European countries, the population of Ireland is ageing as a result of a combination of increasing life expectancy and a declining birth rate. The decline in the birth rate is relatively recent and this, coupled with the effects of high emigration for much of the period up to the 1990s, has resulted in Ireland having the lowest proportion of older people in the EU with 11.2% aged 65 and over, compared to the current EU average of 16.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The proportion of older people in Ireland will remain at broadly the same level for the next ten years after which it is projected to increase rapidly to 15% in 2021, 19% in 2031 and 28% in 2056. A similar situation exists in regard to the number of pensioners relative to the number at work. Ageing, therefore, presents the same challenge to Ireland in meeting growing pension costs as to other countries except that we have a longer period to prepare for its full impact. The population projections suggest no special measures are required in the timescale envisaged by the Deputy. However, the Government is making preparations, through the national pensions reserve fund, to part fund State pensions costs from 2025 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Pensions have been an important issue at EU level in recent years. This is not surprising given that the challenges facing pensions systems are more immediate for other member states. The EU has assessed national pensions systems under the agreed objectives of adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation. In this regard, a joint EU Commission and Council report, published in 2003, considered that Ireland has made good progress in ensuring both the financial sustainability and adequacy of our pensions system. The report concluded our system appears to be, in broad terms, financially sustainable despite projected major increases in future pensions expenditure. The situation will be kept under review.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_943">I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 610 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The questions relates to the effect of the measures announced in November 2003 in the context of the 2004 Estimates. These measures included changes to the back to education allowance, one parent family payment, certain child dependant allowance, changes in the conditions of entitlement to short-term social insurance payments and changes in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including rent supplements under that scheme. The measures were projected to yield savings of €55.8 million in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">In some instances, including the back to education allowance and certain changes in unemployment benefit, the changes have not come into operation. In other cases, where changes have been implemented, it is not possible to quantify precisely the numbers affected by the measures in question or the accruing savings in that, where disallowances occur, the specific reasons for such disallowances may not be recorded on payment computer systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">Data are, however, available in most cases on numbers in receipt of the relevant payments immediately before the measures were introduced and the current position. This data supply some indication of the number of persons affected but it is important to note that the number in receipt of a scheme can and does fluctuate for a wide variety of reasons, such as, for example, seasonal factors in the case of unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">With regard to the one-parent family payment scheme, where transitional half-rate payments were discontinued, there are 460 recipients of such payments, a reduction of 120. These transitional arrangements provided for the retention of entitlement to half of the previous level of payment for one year where a recipient exceeded the weekly earnings threshold of €293 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">With regard to short-term social insurance claims, the period for linking claims to previous claims was increased from 13 to 26 weeks. The number of linked claims has increased by 2,800 to 21,900. This measure does not directly affect the rate of benefit payable, but may cause entitlement to exhaust earlier. This effect will, in certain cases, be offset by the retention of entitlements which would not have applied without the extended linking period. Persons who exhaust their entitlement to unemployment or disability benefit may claim unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">It is not possible to establish the numbers affected by the increase from 39 to 52 in the number of paid contributions required for entitlement to benefit. Affected persons may claim unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance, as appropriate. The earnings threshold for payment of graduated rates of short-term social insurance was raised from €88.88 to €150 to restore the previous relationship with standard rates of payment. The number of graduated rates of payment has increased by 2,000 to 8,500. Affected persons may be entitled to unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">In the case of child dependant allowance payments to recipients of disability and unemployment benefit, there were 63,000 payments of half-rate allowance in payment in cases where the spouse-partner of the recipient was in employment and earning more than €210 per week, the then limit. This allowance was discontinued where earnings exceed €300 per week. The number of such allowances in payment is 46,000 and the weekly rate payable is €8.40 per child.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">In the case of supplementary welfare allowance the numbers of rent supplement payments have decreased since the beginning of 2004 to 58,100, a drop of 1,900. The minimum contribution for all recipients increased by €1 per week. Data are not available on the numbers of persons affected by the requirement, in certain cases, to have been in rented accommodation for six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The number of crèche supplements has fallen from 1,800 to 1,450 while the number of MABS supplements has fallen from 370 to 240. The number of diet supplements has fallen from 13,580 to 13,180. The rate payable to persons who were in receipt of the supplement prior to its commencement in January is unchanged and the rate payable to claimants in 2004 depends on their means and the category of diet which they are on.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">I would like to re-emphasise that the changes in numbers outlined may be due in part to factors other than the policy changes which were made. I am satisfied the measures in question have been implemented in a way which respects the original purpose of the schemes and services in question. Furthermore, these measures produced savings which, in turn, were directly reinvested in a substantial 2004 budget package of €630 million. A budget package of this magnitude enabled the provision of increases well ahead of inflation for all social welfare recipients of weekly payments as well as significant general improvements in social welfare provision generally.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_955">The Deputy is referring to a reply I gave to a press query during the Irish Presidency conference, Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe, on the recognition of same sex partners with children as a form of family. My comment was that, "in terms of official recognition, I do not think Ireland is ready to accept gay marriages as a social norm."</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The conference was examining the profound social, economic and demographic changes taking place and the impact these are having on families, which would encompass same sex couples. Much has been done to afford legal protection to gay and lesbian people as individuals, through the decriminalising of homosexual activity for those who have reached the age of consent and through prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">A further stage is to afford legal protection to same sex couples living together in a long term relationship. One option would be to afford such relationships the same legal protection as that currently afforded married couples though this may not be generally accepted. It could be counterproductive, and even detrimental to the interests of gays and lesbians, to go against public opinion on such a sensitive issue. I do recognise, however, that same sex couples have the same needs, as a couple, for family life, as other citizens, and that appropriate legal protection for that relationship should be provided in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The Law Reform Commission has addressed this issue in a recent report in the context of the granting of legal protection to cohabiting couples. I trust this report will help to inform public opinion on the various issues involved and on various possibilities for their resolution. I hope it will lead to a calm and constructive debate and thus help in promoting the further social inclusion of gays and lesbians, to which I, as Minister for both Social and Family affairs, am fully committed.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">In addition, I have given a commitment to a review of the overall social welfare code in regard to the requirements of the Equal Status Act 2000. The Equality Authority has welcomed this review, which will be conducted in consultation with all interested parties. The review will be based on a framework to be agreed with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The scope and terms of reference of the review and the necessary arrangements for undertaking it are being considered.</p>

     <b>Mr. Crowe</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     the measures she has put in place since taking office to tackle child poverty.

            <p eId="para_961">Tackling child poverty has been and continues to be amongst my key priorities since taking office. Child poverty can seriously diminish the experience and enjoyment of childhood. It can also greatly inhibit the realisation of the potential of children, which can not only have major negative lifelong consequences for their individual well being, but also, in economic terms, for human capital and for social cohesion.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">Strategies to address child poverty and the measures to give effect to them are set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, the national children's strategy and, more recently, in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. The overall target is to reduce the number of children who are consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty amongst children by then. Significant progress has been made towards achieving this target. By 2001, the number of children who are consistently poor had fallen to 6.5% — down from 15.3% in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">One of the key factors underpinning this reduction in child poverty is the reduction in the numbers of parents who are unemployed. Our aim is to continue to maintain high levels of employment and to remove obstacles to taking up employment, especially in the case of lone parents and parents with large families. This approach is reflected in the investment that has been made in child benefit, which offers an effective means of channelling income support to low income families in order to tackle child poverty. Payments amount to €131.60 for the first and second children and €165.30 for third and subsequent children.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">The importance of tackling child poverty is reflected in the fact that ending child poverty was identified as one of ten special initiatives being undertaken under Sustaining Progress. Under this initiative, key policy issues are being addressed, including, for instance: child income support arrangements; the development of a strategy for strengthening families; initiation of a longitudinal study of children; and barriers to employment, particularly for lone parents and larger families. The work being undertaken under the special initiative will further enhance our capacity to tackle the issue of child poverty.</p>

            <p eId="para_966">The development of integrated policies to support families is one of my main priorities as Minister with responsibility for family affairs. It is my intention to provide for the ongoing development of such policies in a strategy for families and family life to be published before the end of this year, the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family. I intend that the strategy will set out the trends in regard to families and family life, the challenges to be faced, the appropriate strategies to meet these challenges, the measures to be taken to give effect to the strategies in the immediate term and the measures to be planned for in the longer term. It will include the institutional arrangements required to ensure the measures are implemented in an integrated effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">I also envisage provision for monitoring implementation of the strategies, evaluating outcomes, adapting existing policies and programmes and, as necessary, developing new ones to ensure families can continue to function effectively at a time of profound change. The strategy will be based and will build on the report of the Commission on the Family and on the nation-wide consultation I undertook last year, which is still ongoing. Full account will be taken of the findings of the research carried out by the UN, OECD, and the Council of Europe, and not least the findings of the international conference hosted by the Irish Presidency in May entitled Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe, supported by the EU Commission. The report on this conference will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">The Commission on the Family in its report recommended that consideration be given to provision for family impact assessments on Government policies and programmes, which would be akin to the family proofing of Government policies referred to by the Deputy. The Commission's proposal was based on recommendations in a 1995 UN publication entitled Indicative Guide for Action on Families. Family proofing or family impact assessments of Government policies could be useful tools for monitoring and evaluating relevant policies that affect families and, accordingly, their use will be examined in the context of drawing up the strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">Following a review of the maximum rent limits carried out in my Department last year I increased the €107 limit to €115 with effect from 1 January 2004. I am satisfied that, rather than having an adverse impact, setting maximum levels has improved the position of people on low incomes in acquiring accommodation because it has a stabilising effect on the market. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market distorts the rental market and leads to a general rise in rent levels that disadvantages people on low incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The ESRI study, to which the Deputy refers, was carried out for the Combat Poverty Agency. It is based on data from the 2000 Living in Ireland survey and earlier surveys and was completed in 2003. One of its key findings is that problems with the affordability of dwellings are most severe in the private rented sector and that they have the greatest impact from a poverty perspective in that sector. The study found that from 1987 to 1999-2000, the share of household expenditure absorbed by rent among private tenants increased 1.7 times from 12.5% to 21% while the share of household expenditure taken up by mortgage payments remained more or less stable at approximately 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and who have no other accommodation available to them. The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to deal with emergencies and short term needs that arise when a person suffers a change in circumstances, for example, when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford to pay rent.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Rent supplements were never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs as this is best met through housing by the local authorities. In recognition of the fact that the rent supplement scheme had, in effect, become a long-term housing support for many people the Government set up a working group to rationalise current arrangements for housing support. Our objective is to ensure long-term housing needs are addressed through providing appropriate solutions with the involvement of the housing authorities rather than through the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">An interdepartmental planning group was established to draw up detailed proposals for the implementation of revised arrangements. Arising from the work of this group an action plan is being finalised and this will include criteria for determining which categories of rent supplement recipient will be eligible to have their needs addressed by the housing authorities, an implementation timescale and other matters. I expect to put proposals to Government on this matter shortly.</p>

     the efforts she has made to reduce the risk of poverty faced by lone parents, persons with disabilities and the elderly, particularly elderly women; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_978">The most recent figures on poverty levels in Ireland are based on the analysis by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the results of the 2001 Living in Ireland survey. This analysis indicates that the highest risk of experiencing consistent poverty is faced by lone parents, families with four or more children, people with disabilities and the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The consistent poverty measure identifies the numbers who are experiencing income poverty and basic deprivation in terms of being consistently deprived of goods and services regarded as essential for living in Ireland today. The level of consistent poverty has fallen steadily from 15% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2001. We have set a target in the national anti-poverty strategy of reducing consistent poverty to below 2% by 2007 and, ideally, eliminating it altogether.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The analysis also indicates that the at risk of poverty rate, that is, the number of people with incomes below 60% of equivalised median income, has increased overall from 19.8% in 1998 to 21.9% in 2001. It also indicates that the risk of falling below that income threshold is highest for the elderly, lone parents, the larger families, the ill or disabled, persons on home duties and the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">There are a number of factors which contribute to the relatively high at risk of poverty rate. During periods of high economic growth, increases in household income can outstrip even substantial increases in the incomes of households with relatively low earnings or on social welfare. This is what happened in Ireland in recent years. There were particular circumstances in the period from the mid-1990s when a combination of increased female participation in the workforce, reduced unemployment generally, tax reform and, crucially, high earnings growth caused very large increases in household income. These increases in household incomes were substantially higher than increases both in individual earnings and social welfare incomes over this period, despite virtually unprecedented improvements in employment and social provision across the board in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The policies pursued by the Government over recent years with regard to income supports have brought about significant improvements in the situation of people in receipt of such supports. In the period from 1998 to 2003, for example, the value of the lowest social welfare payments increased by more than 50% in nominal terms and by 19% in real terms. In the case of pensioners, the increases awarded have been higher again with the old age contributory pension increasing by almost 26% in real terms and the old age non-contributory pension increasing by 33% in real terms over the same period. With regard to persons with disabilities, the weekly personal rate of disability allowance has increased by more than 57% or a real increase in excess of 26% since 1997. The 2004 budget continued this progression, as it included a social welfare package of €630 million and the effect of this increase is that the total social welfare spend in 2004 will be almost double that of 1997. As a result, my Department now has an annual budget of more than €11 billion to support those who are vulnerable, less well off or disadvantaged in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The Government's determination to continue to improve the position of the most vulnerable in our society is reflected in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, and in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion which contain ambitious targets across a number of areas, including that of increasing the minimum social welfare rate to €150 per week, in 2002 terms, by 2007. The challenge now is to sustain and build on the progress we have made to date so that we can achieve our overarching objective of building a more inclusive society.</p>

     if her attention has been drawn to recent statistics from EUROSTAT showing that social expenditure here is at 14.6% of gross domestic product, in contrast to the European average of 27.5%; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_985">EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU. This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes and other social inclusion programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The latest such statistics were released on 23 April 2004 and deal with developments up to and including 2001. No comparable figures are yet available for 2002 or 2003. When examining such data it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions as opposed to direct cash payments. The EUROSTAT release draws attention to the fact the European average masks major national differences in the structure of social protection funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Ireland, with one of the youngest populations in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and health care and care of the elderly than most other member states. In addition, social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is crucially dependent on the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment. Statistics show that at EU level, between 1993 and 1996, social protection expenditure relative to GDP stabilised at a level below the peak of 28.8% in 1993. This was due to renewed GDP growth and slower growth in social protection expenditure, particularly related to unemployment benefits. Over the period from 1996, the EU average dropped from 28.4% to the level of 27.5% in 2001. Ireland's position mirrored that of the EU as a whole, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries and, consequently, the drop in the percentage of GDP accounted for by social protection expenditure was greater. The fact is that under this Government, there have been sustained and substantial increases in social protection expenditure. The EUROSTAT report states that the increase in real terms expenditure on social protection in four EU countries, including Ireland at 4.7% per annum, over the period 1992 to 2001 was "particularly marked". The EU average was 1.9%. The EUROSTAT figures show a 40% increase in the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on social protection in Ireland in the period 1994 to 2001, compared with an EU average of 13.9%. The Government will continue to address the scope for further improvements in Ireland’s social protection infrastructure, guided by the national anti-poverty strategy, while at the same time continuing to take the measures necessary to maintain economic growth and competitiveness and thereby generate the resources for further social investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">The Irish Presidency conference in question examined the theme of "Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe". One of the main changes affecting families is the growing participation of women in the workforce. As a result one of the key challenges to be addressed by families is how to reconcile work and family life.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">One outcome is that many women are left to carry the double burden of work and care of home and children. It is still frequently expected that women will give precedence to caregiving, while in the case of men it is still more acceptable to give precedence to the demands of employment. One illustration of this is that 98% of those receiving the one-parent family payment in 2002 were women.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">These societal attitudes on the respective parenting roles of men and women are, in my opinion, inevitably reflected in decisions given on arrangements for custody and access to the children when parents decide to separate. Custody is generally awarded to the mother and the arrangements made for access and the way in which these are enforced may not reflect the previous degree of involvement of the father in the child's upbringing and the father's desire for such involvement. In some cases this may result in fathers being denied reasonable access to their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">It is in the interests of all family members, fathers, mothers and children, that fathers assume a more equal share in the care of their children and that this is more effectively facilitated, especially by employers. This should in time ease the double burden that many women have to bear, contribute to achieving a more effective balance of work and family life, and lead to more effective parenting.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">Changes of this kind are unlikely to occur overnight and are for the longer term. In the meantime, the difficulties some fathers are experiencing in gaining access to their children, when they are living separately from the mother, must be addressed and the current legal provisions governing this need to be examined. The mediation services administered by the Family Support Agency can also make a significant immediate contribution, which is one of the reasons I have sought and obtained funding to expand the service further, in the north-west and the midlands this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">This issue will also be addressed in the strategy on supports for families in preparation for issue before the end of the year. I was pleased in this context to be in a position to fund, as part of the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family, the first national fathers' conference on 14 June, at which a range of issues affecting unmarried and separated fathers were addressed. I look forward to receiving a report on the outcome of the conference, which will be fully taken into account in developing the strategy.</p>

The measures in question produced savings which freed up resources towards a substantial budget 2004 package of €630 million.

            <p eId="para_1002">The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, is to provide assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their basic needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">In addition to a basic weekly allowance, assistance may be provided in the form of supplements which may be paid in respect of needs such as rent, mortgage interest, diet or special heating requirements or in any other case where it appears to the board that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A single payment to meet an exceptional need as well as payments in urgent cases can also be made. There is no automatic right of entitlement to an exceptional need or urgent payment. Such payments are made at the discretion of the health board taking into account all of the circumstances of a case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The number of recipients of basic supplementary welfare allowance on 4 June 2004 was 29,893. Rent supplements are paid to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs. Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The number of recipients of rent supplement is approximately 58,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">Mortgage interest supplements are paid in respect of the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. There are some 3,600 recipients of mortgage interest supplement. Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition may also qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. There are some 13,000 recipients of diet supplement. A heating supplement is a payment made to a person whose means are insufficient to meet the cost of exceptional heating needs. There are some 3,000 recipients of heating supplements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">Health boards also have the power to award a supplement in any other case where it appears to the board that the circumstances of the case so warrant. The number of recipients of other supplements is approximately 5,500. Under the SWA scheme, a health board may issue payments in urgent cases and to meet an exceptional once-off need which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional and urgent needs payments. There were some 4,500 such payments at the beginning of June 2004. Depending on his or her individual circumstances, a person could receive two or more types of supplementary welfare allowance at any given time. For example, about 13,000 people who receive a basic weekly allowance also receive a rent supplement. In total more than 100,000 people receive a supplementary welfare allowance payment in any given week.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">The 2003 annual report of the Equality Authority records that there were 23 social welfare-related complaints made to the authority last year, an increase of 11 over the 2002 figure. The authority has confirmed that this figure of 23 is cumulative, that is, it includes complaints that were unresolved at the end of 2002 and carried forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The Department works with the Equality Authority to ensure that the equality-diversity dimension continues to underpin and inform our policies and service delivery approach. Examples of this include the development, under the advice of the authority, of diversity awareness training courses for staff, and participation in a working group on equality-diversity, which is chaired by the Equality Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">In addition, last year, the office for social inclusion in my Department collaborated with the authority in developing an equality proofing exercise on the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. There has also been collaboration between the Combat Poverty Agency and the authority. Last June I was pleased to launch their joint report, entitled Poverty and Inequality — Applying an Equality Dimension to Poverty Proofing, which highlights the link between the promotion of equality and the anti-poverty process and offers a template that can be used by policy makers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">I have given a commitment to a review of the overall social welfare code in relation to the requirements of the Equal Status Act 2000. The Equality Authority has welcomed this review which will be done in consultation with all interested parties. The review will be based on a framework to be agreed with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The scope and terms of reference of the review and the necessary arrangements for undertaking it are being considered at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">Clearly, any complaint made in relation to the provision of social welfare services is a matter of concern to me. A fundamental principle of the Department's customer service strategy is to ensure that every person is treated in an equitable and non-discriminatory way. In that regard, my Department has a well-established comments and complaints procedure and it is open to any person to exercise his or her right of appeal or redress through all the available channels. Any complaints which are made are investigated and any appropriate action which is required is taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_1015">The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case and it was never intended to be an ongoing source of funding for crèches.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">My Department is not aware of the closure of any crèche as a result of the withdrawal of crèche supplement payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Necessary child care services should be funded directly in a sustainable and appropriate manner. In that regard, I point out that this approach has been successfully adopted in certain health boards. The boards in question, along with other agencies have put in place appropriate, long term and sustainable arrangements to meet the needs of the families concerned without requiring them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance. I want to see that approach taken up in the other health board regions so that we have sustainable child care arrangements in place throughout the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">I have held discussions with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science as well as health board representatives regarding a more co-ordinated approach to the provision of crèche and pre-school supports. It is a matter for the agencies with responsibility for child care to ensure that adequate arrangements are put in place to meet child care needs. As an interim measure, crèche supplements in payment prior to 1 January 2004 are being allowed to continue. The changes introduced relating to crèche supplements paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are necessary to refocus that scheme on its original objective of providing short-term income support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">In the meantime, health boards retain discretion to provide assistance by way of once-off exceptional needs payments in any case where a board considers that the circumstances of the case so warrant.</p>

            <p eId="para_1020">The revised national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, was launched by the Government in February 2002. The key objectives of the strategy are to reduce, and ideally eliminate, consistent poverty; build an inclusive society; and develop social capital, particularly for disadvantaged communities. The strategy sets out a range of targets in the areas of income adequacy, employment and unemployment, education, health, and housing and accommodation. In addition, specific targets have been established in respect of groups identified as being particularly vulnerable to poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">In relation to the issue of income adequacy in particular, the target set in the revised NAPS is to achieve a rate of €150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest social welfare rates by 2007. The target has been restated in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion for 2003 to 2005 and in Sustaining Progress. The Government remains committed to the achievement of this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">The issue of the level of increases introduced in any given year is one which must be assessed in the context of the budgetary process, having regard to the level of resources available and the competing demands on those resources. In this regard, it should be noted that the increases provided for in the budget from 2004 fully protect or enhance in real terms the standard of living of all social welfare recipients.</p>

            <p eId="para_1024">The statement in question was made in a wide-ranging paper presented at the international conference organised and hosted by the Irish Presidency, with the support of the European Commission, entitled Families, Change and European Social Policy. One of the family-related changes identified in the paper concerns the growing proportion of couples living together as partners, without entering into marriage and assuming the legal obligations to each other which marriage involves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">Generally up to the recent past, a couple, having decided they wished to have a permanent relationship, would get married and soon afterwards have children. Now, a growing proportion of couples live together on a permanent basis but may postpone marriage indefinitely. Undertaking the responsibilities and obligations of having children becomes a separate decision and some couples may decide to forgo taking on parenting responsibilities given the effect it may have on their lives. This is the disjuncture between partnership and parenting referred to in the paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">Changes made in regard to gender equality and for safeguarding the rights of children and promoting good parenting themselves make, and will continue to make, a major contribution to individual well-being and quality of life generally. They present, however, new challenges to be addressed in promoting social inclusion and greater social cohesion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Marriage is now seen by some as unduly restrictive on individual freedom. This may have been in part due to the emphasis in much public debate in recent years on marital breakdown, separation and divorce. There has not been the same emphasis on the extent to which the obligations of marriage can safeguard basically healthy and life-enhancing relationships, especially through difficult periods, provide for individual security and family stability generally and provide a secure emotional environment for the upbringing of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The State recognises the pressures that marriage and partnerships generally are under and one of the main tasks of the Family Support Agency, which I formally established last year, is to address these. This includes supporting the provision of counselling to assist couples in overcoming difficulties in their relationships. It also includes a nationwide family mediation service to help couples who decide to separate to come to appropriate arrangements in a constructive, amicable manner on living separately, especially in relation to the custody and access to their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">Parenting emerged as an issue of major concern for many of those who attended the family fora which I held last year. People are conscious of the scale of the responsibility involved in rearing children in ways that will enable them to succeed in today's world and of all the pitfalls to be avoided. As a result many parents are seeking more guidance and support in regard to effective parenting. There is also a need in this context to place emphasis on the joys as well as the problems associated with parenting and provide much reassurance to parents as to their own innate capacities in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">There will be a role for the Family Support Agency, the health boards and other relevant organisations in ensuring the provision of such parental support. These issues, together with many others related to families and family life identified at the conference and at the public consultation fora, will be addressed in the strategy for supports to families, currently being prepared, which I intend to have available before the end of this year.</p>

     <b>Mr. J. Bruton </b>
      asked the 
     <b>Taoiseach</b>
     if his Department has achieved the target, set out in the initiation of the expenditure review initiative in 1997, that all Government expenditure be subject to a formal review under that initiative every three years; and if not, the areas of expenditure in respect of which the three yearly review has not taken place.

            <p eId="para_1038">I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">While the initial objective of the expenditure review process was to review all programmes over a three-year period under the initial expenditure review programme, 1997 to 2000, it was agreed that three reviews would be undertaken by my Department. Two of these reviews on the Information Society Commission and the National Centre for Partnership were undertaken. However, a decision was taken, with the agreement of the Department of Finance, not to proceed with the third proposed review which was in respect of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, as this review was overtaken by the Government decision to establish the National Economic and Social Development Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">In a review of the process undertaken at the end of the first three-year expenditure review programme, 1997 to 2000, and in light of the findings of a value for money study on the expenditure review initiative undertaken by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it was accepted that the target of covering all programme areas in a three-year period was overly ambitious and a more focused approach to the selection of reviews was agreed by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">A new work programme for the period 2001 to 2004 was agreed between this Department and the Department of Finance based on the following new criteria for the selection of reviews: programmes reflecting Government priorities or strategic review areas; programmes involving significant levels of expenditure; programmes where expenditure has been growing unusually quickly; programmes where the external environment has changed substantially since the programme was introduced; and programmes whose objectives are proving particularly difficult to achieve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">Following a review of the Department's programmes for 2002 and subsequent years, it was agreed with the Department of Finance that, due to the relatively small size of the Department's Vote and the nature and size of individual programme allocations, the objectives of the expenditure review initiative would not in general be best served by selecting individual programmes for review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">It was suggested that the Department's role in several cross-departmental issues which clearly fit the selection criteria would be an area in which my Department could have a more useful input. The resulting work programme for my Department included one review of the National Economic and Social Development Office. This review is due to be undertaken following enactment of the NESDO legislation which is going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">It is my understanding that a limited number of cross-departmental reviews were selected to be undertaken on a pilot basis as part of the 2001-04 expenditure review initiative, in view of the complexity of these reviews and the need to formulate an effective approach to them. My Department did not have any close involvement in the areas to which these reviews related but would expect to be involved in similar reviews in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1258">My Department has been in contact with both the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, which is the independent statutory office responsible for providing advice and information to consumers and enforcing a wide range of consumer protection laws, and the European Consumer Centre, Dublin, ECC, which is an independent company providing free information and advice on consumer rights in the EU and co-funded by the European Commission and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, on this matter and both bodies had corresponded with the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The ODCA has responsibility for enforcing the Package Holiday and Travel Trade Act 1995. However, the Act governs travel agents-organisers who sell package travel within Ireland and who have an office within the State. I am informed by the ODCA that the company concerned has no registered office in Ireland and that all its business is conducted in and from the UK. The ODCA further advises that the possibility of reviewing this contract under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1995 is also thwarted by the location of the relevant company's offices. Under the circumstances, the ODCA has indicated that there is little it can do about complaints like these other than to advise consumers to purchase their holidays from tour operators who are licensed and bonded in this country by the Commission for Aviation Regulation. In fact, this advice is number one on the ODCA's top tips for an enjoyable holiday which can be found on that office's website at <i>www.ocdca.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The European Consumer Centre, ECC, Dublin has advised that it has dealt with 70 cases, and many more information requests, to date regarding complaints against the company concerned in the context of its work in assisting consumers with cross-border disputes. The ECC has been in constant contact with the company to achieve an amicable solution for Irish consumers and has been informed by its managing director that his company was withdrawing from the Irish market and that refunds would be issued to Irish complainants. The ECC is not aware of consumers having received refunds at this stage. The ECC has kept the ODCA and the UK Office of Fair Trading informed of its concerns and developments at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">The ECC advises that if an amicable solution is not achieved, the consumer's rights cannot be vindicated in the small claims court in Ireland as the company is based in the UK. Under the terms of the Rome Convention, the consumer can sue the company from Ireland but the practical reality is that this would mean incurring costs far in excess of the amount lost. On an individual basis, the consumer could take a case to the small claims court in the UK, but this would involve the expense of travel and accommodation to attend that court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">The possibility of the ODCA taking action under the EU injunctions directive, 98/27/EC, to protect consumer interests in relation to future activities by holiday promotion firms has also been raised by the ECC and I have requested the ODCA to explore this further.</p>

            <p eId="para_1264">For each day an employee is entitled to 11 consecutive hours off under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

When an employee works 14 days but did not receive the 24 hour rest period after seven days, he or she is entitled to a total of 59 consecutive hours off, that is, two days — 48 hours — plus 11 hours for the previous day. If, after working 14 days an employee does not receive 59 consecutive hours off, he or she is entitled to two separate rest periods of 35 consecutive hours each.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Certain transport employees are not entitled to the above rest periods. Employees who work in sectors in which the rate of production or provision of services will vary significantly from time to time and employees who are directly involved in ensuring continuity of production or continuity in the provision of services are also exempt from the above rest periods. These employees, however, are entitled to compensatory rest, that is, any hours of rest forgone must be made up to them by their employer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1267">Changes being contemplated with regard to the role of Shannon Development are consistent with and arise primarily as a result of the Government decision to decentralise the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, involving 300 of that agency's Dublin-based staff, to Shannon. At present, Shannon Development performs a range of functions on a delegated authority basis for Enterprise Ireland and it has been decided, in light of decentralisation, that these functions should revert to Enterprise Ireland. This is an entirely practical development as it would make little sense to have two agencies in the same location performing the same functions. The decision, which is fully supported by the board of Shannon Development, will result in the transfer of the Shannon Development staff engaged on these functions to Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">Second, it has been agreed that the management of Shannon town should be transferred from Shannon Development and vested in Clare County Council. Again, this is a decision that has been made on practical grounds and both Shannon Development and Clare County Council are in agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The proposal by the Minister for Transport, which is again supported by the board of Shannon Development, to establish an independent Shannon Airport authority is also important in this context. Without an independent and viable Shannon Airport, the task of guaranteeing the entire region's continued attractiveness as a tourist destination and as a location for investment would be made considerably more difficult. In that regard, one of the options under consideration is to transfer the assets of the Shannon Free Zone to the new airport authority. While no decision has been taken on this issue, the transfer of the assets would mean no change to either the status of the zone or its attractiveness as an investment location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">In the light of these changed circumstances, I met the chairman, some members of the board of Shannon Development and the chief executive of the company on several occasions to explain and expand on matters under consideration. At the meetings, I also asked the board to bring forward detailed proposals in regard to the role that Shannon Development can play in the future development of the region and this discussion is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">I am committed to the future of Shannon and the mid-west region as a whole. My concern is to ensure that we put in place the most sensible and efficient structures and manage the region's most valuable and strategic assets so as to optimise their benefit for the entire region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1273">I understand from Shannon Development that a total of 185.5 staff — expressed in terms of full-time equivalents — are employed by the agency. These staff are employed on a range of duties relating to industrial development, tourism, property management and general administration functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">On functions carried out on a delegated authority basis for Enterprise Ireland activities, the number of staff ranges between 50 and 100 depending on the assumptions made in relation to the allocation of the support and administrative staff associated with those delegated functions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">Apprenticeship is the recognised means by which persons are trained to become craftspersons in Ireland. The main craft trades have been designated by FÁS and come within the scope of the statutory apprenticeship system. Apprenticeship in Ireland is organised by FÁS in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science, employers and unions. There are about 23,000 registered apprentices in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1301">The Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004 also provide recognition for another form of agreement known as registered employment agreements. In this instance, an agreement is negotiated by the two sides in an industry or enterprise and is presented to the Labour Court for registration. There are 45 registered employment agreements, REAs, on the register maintained by the Labour Court. Two of those REAs that are actively enforced by the inspectorate have set rates of payment for apprentices and details are contained in the tables set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">At present, there is no employment regulation order or registered employment agreement that specifically covers cabinet makers. There are trainee rates contained in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. Trainee rates are applicable to trainees, aged 18 or over, in structured training. The trainee rates are as follows: trainee in the first third of training period over age 18 is €5.25 per hour; trainee in the second third of training period over age 18 is €5.60 per hour; and trainee in the final third of training period over age 18 is €6.30 per hour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 applies a strict definition of trainee and structured training. For example, for the above trainee rates to apply, at least 10% of the employee's training must occur outside day-to-day operational duties, there must be an assessment and certification procedure or written confirmation of the employee's completion of the course identifying the level of attainment of the employee against the objectives of the structured training, and the training must be related to improvement of work performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for the enforcement of employment rights arising from a range of employment rights legislation. The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 falls within that remit and, accordingly, enforcement of its provisions is an aspect of a labour inspector's work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1366">In advance of completion of the public service broker, my Department, as per the joint programme, has embarked on an ambitious e-Government agenda aimed at ensuring that the public have electronic access to services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">These services include access to the Patents Office registers, databases and official journals. The Companies Registration Office provides e-forms for registering a business and filing returns, on-line database searching and calculation of late filing penalties. An on-line redundancy calculator is also available and enables the calculation of statutory redundancy entitlements for an employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">The BASIS website, <i> www.basis.ie</i>, which was developed by my Department is a one-stop-shop for all public sector information on services that are relevant to the business community. This information is presented in an integrated way, based around the everyday actions of a business like employing staff, funding and expanding one’s business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">New e-services that are under development in my Department include the on-line payment of trademark, patent and industrial design renewal fees; an electronic application and payment system for work permits; the on-line payment of certain Companies Registration Office fees; and a system for on-line submission of redundancy claims for workers and applications for redundancy rebates for employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">To ensure the continued development of on-line services a review of the Department's e-strategy is scheduled to be carried out in the last quarter of this year. Links to all existing and new services will be available through the single point of contact, <i>reachservices.ie</i>, as and when the public service broker is fully implemented.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_400">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1373">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">Expenditure reviews under the expenditure review initiative have been undertaken on the following five areas: community employment; IDA 1994-1997; FÁS's standards-based apprenticeship programme; Forfás; and FÁS's traineeship and specific skills training programmes. Additionally, two further expenditure reviews under the initiative on IDA Ireland's property portfolio and Enterprise Ireland's overseas office network are nearing completion. Two other expenditure reviews are under way, one relating to supports for the long-term unemployed, which is a cross-departmental review, and a review of science and technology spending. All of these programmes represent approximately 60% of the Department's 2004 voted programme expenditure plus the national training fund. The remaining elements of my Department's voted programme expenditure has not yet been reviewed under the initiative. It is likely that the Department will shortly decide on the likely programmes to be reviewed under the next tranche of expenditure reviews.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">In addition to expenditure reviews under the expenditure review initiative, my Department is very much involved in programme evaluations carried out under the national development plan-community support structure process, in conjunction with the NDP central evaluation unit. Furthermore, the science and technology budget includes a line for evaluations-reviews and has a culture of ongoing evaluation. Other reviews are carried out on an ongoing basis by my Department's agencies, such as FÁS, Forfás etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance, expenditure review central steering committee, ERCSC, in 2000-01 found that this target had been overly ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the ERI in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">In June 2001, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments-offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, that is, that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC asked Departments-offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments-offices should select a small number of programmes-areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments-offices.</p>

Additionally, in the case of soft drinks, there is statutory information available to enable the consumer to decide whether to purchase the product, in the form of the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order 1999, SI 263 of 1999, which obliges publicans to display the price of alcoholic and soft drinks just outside or immediately inside their premises.</p>

            <p eId="para_1382">Officials of my Department recently finalised a comprehensive implementation plan on the decentralisation of those sections-offices of the Department which have been approved by me for relocation to Carlow. The document was substantially completed within the time limit as laid down by the decentralisation implementation group. However, my Department was concerned to ensure that the information provided in the plan would be of the highest quality possible. Therefore, it was decided to spend some extra days finalising the plan to ensure that a high standard document was presented to the decentralisation implementation group. I am satisfied that the additional time taken had no material impact other than improving the quality of the report submitted. The preparation of the plan was treated as a priority by my Department and necessitated input from staff in all of the areas of the Department selected for decentralisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1410">The policy review groups with a public consultative process which are under way within my Department are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1411">1. <i>Enterprise Strategy Group</i>
                        </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1412">On 28 July 2003 I announced the formation of an independent enterprise strategy group to examine options that I and my Government colleagues might consider in developing medium-term enterprise polices. On 1 August 2003, I announced the membership of that group under the chairmanship of Mr. Eoin O'Driscoll. As part of its work, the group's public consultation process has already been completed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1413">2. <i>Company Law Review Group</i>
                        </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1414">The company law review group is a standing statutory advisory body on the reform and modernisation of Irish company law. The review group reports to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The review group was set up in February 2000 on foot of Government decision. The group operated on an administrative basis until it was accorded a statutory advisory status by the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. Part 7 of that Act sets out the role and the advisory responsibilities of the review group and the basis on which its members are appointed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1415">The first report of the review group was the culmination of its work programme for 2000 to 2001 and was published on 28 February 2002. The report mapped out a strategy for the restructuring, consolidation, simplification and modernisation of company law in Ireland. The general scheme of the Bill to give effect to the proposals for this reform of company law is now being drafted. A second report of the review group was published in May 2004. That report elaborates on implementation of the recommendations in the first report as well as recommending changes in a number of sectoral areas such as share capital and windings up. The recommendations in the second report will be factored into the general scheme of the Bill.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1416">For the purposes of public consultation, as each component part of the general scheme of the Bill is drawn up, it is placed on the website of the Company Law Review Group, <i>www.clrg.org</i>, for consideration and comment by interested parties. Comments received will inform the proposals in the general scheme of the Bill to be brought to Government for approval.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1417">3. <i>Consumer Strategy Group</i>
                        </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1418">In March 2004 I established the consumer strategy group, under chairperson Ann Fitzgerald, chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Managers. The group has been asked to advise and make recommendations for the development of a national consumer policy strategy. Forfás provides the group's secretariat.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1427">I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 to 142, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">As I explained in my reply to Questions Nos. 204 to 206, inclusive, on 27 April 2004, red safety areas were first adopted at Casement Aerodrome following a review in 1992 by Aer Rianta, on behalf of the Department of Defence, of policy in relation to safety zones at the aerodrome. With regard to the rationale therefor, International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations in relation to obstacle limitation surfaces for airports as well as considerations in regard to public safety in the vicinity of the aerodrome were taken into account in determining the size and shape of the red safety areas at Casement Aerodrome. The areas are essentially two-dimensional surfaces on the ground originating 60 metres beyond the runway thresholds, have a width of 300 metres and diverge at a rate of 15% at each side to a width of 700 metres and have an overall length of 1,370 metres in the case of each runway. The three-dimensional areas are the runway approach surfaces which extend outwards from the same start point as the red safety areas and the bases of which rise above the ground at a rate of 1:50 for the first 3,000 metres and then at a rate of 1:40 for 3,600 metres to a maximum height of 150 metres above the start point to a total distance of 15,000 metres from the start point. A more detailed technical explanation of such areas is outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, in his replies to Question No. 480 on 16 December 2003, Question No. 415 on 3 February 2004 and Question No. 438 on 17 February 2004. While the consultants' report prepared in 1999, referred to by the Deputy, contains discourse regarding safety zone determinants adopted by certain regulatory authorities such as the CAA and FAA, the recommendation in the case of Casement Aerodrome contained in the report was that the approach areas be retained for security and safety reasons because of the large proportion of training, including single engine-solo flights by inexperienced pilots, carried out at the aerodrome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">A visual comparison of the map included in the Aer Rianta report of 1992 and the map included at 313a of the 1983 Dublin County development plan indicates the extent of difference in the shapes of the restricted areas. For example, area A indicated on the 1983 development plan map takes the form of a skewed cross encompassing the aerodrome and its environs with each end extending outwards from the runways for a distance of up to 1,500 metres and at a width of 1,600 metres. No development was permissible in area A. Following the 1992 report, area A was replaced by cone shaped red safety areas whose dimensions have been detailed above.</p>

Some of the key proposals were then put to the associations representing officers and enlisted personnel late last year in the context of the negotiations on the application to the Defence Forces of Sustaining Progress. Those negotiations also involved the preparation of an action plan covering the development and implementation of a range of modernisation elements, including key IPMS elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">Those negotiations were successful in the period before Christmas and both associations signed up to Sustaining Progress and to the implementation of the action plan over the period to mid-2005. The implementation process is now under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1442">The initial target of the Expenditure Review Initiative, ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance/Expenditure Review Central Steering Committee in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the ERI in 2001, which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">In June 2001, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments/offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, i.e. that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc.. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC asked Departments/offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Department’s offices should select a small number of programmes/areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments/Offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">Under the aegis of the Expenditure Review Initiative and the efficiency audit group process which preceded that, the Department of Defence has completed and published the following reviews: The White Paper on Defence; Review and Implementation Plan for the Naval Service; Review and Implementation Plan for the Air Corps; and Provision of Medical Services for members of the Defence Forces. It might be noted that these reviews, together, effectively cover all Defence Vote expenditure.</p>

The definition of relative in the regulations includes brothers and therefore the same rules apply in the case of transfer between brothers as in the case between a parent and a child. The transfer of milk quota without land is not permitted, even between relatives, except in cases where there is a land and quota leasing arrangement in place. In that case the milk quota may be purchased without the land so long as the lease has been in place for at least one year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1465">EU rules in relation to sheep flocks in which scrapie is confirmed require member states either to slaughter infected flocks in their entirety and prohibit re-stocking with sheep for three years from the date of slaughter, or alternatively to determine the susceptibility of the animals to scrapie by genotyping, and slaughter the more scrapie susceptible animals only.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">The national sheep identification system, NSIS, came into operation on the 21 June 2001. From that date, all sheep must be tagged on movement off farm with a tag bearing the flock number of the farm and an individual number. All sheep remaining on farms must be tagged at the latest by 15 December. The system also provides for the issue of replacement tags and import tags. The individual tag numbers are issued centrally by my Department and tags are supplied by commercial operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">Tag supply companies and individual tags are approved on an annual basis. Approval is subject to compliance with strict criteria laid down by my Department. Failure by any company to meet the criteria may lead to that company being removed from the list of approved suppliers and or an approved tag being withdrawn from the market. This year, 13 tag suppliers have been approved to supply tags to farmers. This allows farmers a wide choice as to the type of tag they wish to use and commercial competition has ensured that tags are available at a reasonable price. To date more than 23 million tags have been issued by approved suppliers to over 46,000 flock-owners — more than 6.5 million of which were short term tags which can be used only for lambs moving directly from farm to factory.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The performance of NSIS in general, including that of tag suppliers and tags, has been satisfactory over the past three years. Where isolated problems have arisen, it has been possible within the context of the approved tag supplier arrangements to address them quickly and effectively and in a manner which does not affect the integrity of the system as a whole. Where instances of tag fading are brought to the attention of my Department, they are taken up immediately with the relevant supplier with a view to having the problem corrected and replacement tags issued to the affected flockowners. Particular design features of NSIS as a whole will allow for any faded tags to be replaced without undermining compliance with the requisite requirements for correct individual animal identification and traceability.</p>

The species is regarded as a pest in forests as it feeds on the buds, flowers and seeds of trees.

The grey squirrel poses a significant threat to those broadleaf crops planted since 1995.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">The electronic delivery of services through a single point of contact is being progressed through the framework of the public services broker and the Reach agency, which reports to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and is charged with responsibility for its design and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">It is intended that the first stage of the public services broker will be launched at the end of this month. This will be a public facing website, to be known as <i>reachservices.ie,</i> designed to act as a single point of access to a range of services offered by the Irish public service. Initially <i>reachservices.ie</i> will provide access in the form of links to forms or online services provided on other websites. It will provide access to information and application forms for up to 900 services at time of launch. The range of services accessible through <i>reachservices.ie</i> will continue to be expanded until it provides a fully comprehensive index to the full range of publicly provided services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">My Department has been co-operating fully in relation to the ongoing development of the public services broker, providing information and contact details for services for the immediate launch, as well as commencing development work on two services that will feature in the next phase of the broker. Many of my Department's services have already been made available electronically through our website, <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie.</i> These services have been developed with due cognisance of the ongoing development of the public services broker and adhere to the standards specified by the broker development team. As development of the public sector broker continues, all of my Department’s services that can be provided electronically will be made available, over time, through the public services broker.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">The number of schemes and services that are provided by my Department will substantially change after the introduction of the single farm payment in 2005. A review of all services is currently being undertaken to ascertain those services that will be most suitable for electronic provision in the future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
            <p eId="para_1504">I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-2001 found that this target had been over ambitious and a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the ERI in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments-offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, i.e. that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments and offices should select a small number of programmes areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">In the light of what I have outlined, my Department has undertaken a total of 12 expenditure reviews in the areas listed. The position in regard to these is as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_1540">EU and national regulations on the milk quota system specify that, where the national quota is exceeded, the overrun must be shared between those producers who contributed to the excess. The regulations do not provide for exceptions in individual cases and therefore it is not open to me to intervene in these cases. The amount of levy payable in individual cases can, of course, be reduced by the distribution of unused quota, flexi milk, resulting from other producers not filling their individual quotas. This distribution is done on the basis of objective criteria. My Department on a regular basis throughout the year publishes estimates of milk deliveries and the extent to which these are under or over the national quota and advises producers to keep in close touch with their co-ops-dairies in this matter.</p>

The only restriction on former participants in the scheme of early retirement from farming is that they cannot return to commercial farming in their own right. I have recently secured the agreement of the European Commission that retired farmers, both during and after their time as participants in the early retirement scheme, may engage in farming related activities as an employee of a business providing services to farmers, although a retired farmer cannot work on the farm from which he or she retired, or work directly for another farmer.</p>

          </question>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
            <p eId="para_1636">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 100(1)(<i>h</i>) of the Finance Act 1999 allows relief from mineral oil tax on “mineral oil which is intended for use or has been used as fuel for the purpose of sea navigation, including sea fishing, other than in private pleasure craft”.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">Since the craft referred to by the Deputy are for use on inland waterways, the fuel they use does not qualify for this excise relief. I have currently no plans to amend the legislation to provide for such relief because there are concerns regarding the potential difficulties in controlling such a scheme and also the likely negative impact on tax yields.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">Regarding the question of VAT and rescue craft also raised by the Deputy, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No.18) Order, 1985, provides for the repayment of VAT costs incurred in respect of equipment for use only in respect of rescue or assistance at sea. The order does not extend to fuel in respect of seagoing rescue craft or to fuel or equipment used in rescue craft operational on fresh water bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">I have no plans to extend the VAT repayment arrangements for equipment used in rescue at sea to that used by rescue craft operating in fresh water bodies or to introduce such an arrangement facilitating a refund on VAT incurred on fuel costs. Practical difficulties in distinguishing the intended use of such equipment and fuel and the potential costs to the Exchequer are my main concerns in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">However, the Deputy may be aware that the VAT legislation provides for zero-rating of "life saving services provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, including the organisation and maintenance of the lifeboat service". This means that while the RNLI do not charge VAT on the services they provide, they are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on the goods and services which they purchase in delivering their services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">In addition, the Irish Coast Guard, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, administers the community inland and inshore rescue services grant scheme. The Community of Inshore Rescue Services and the Inland Rescue Service may apply for grants under the scheme in respect of both current and, more recently, capital expenditures. Guidelines on the scheme in terms of eligibility criteria and grant levels are available from the Irish Coast Guard. I hope this clarifies the position regarding excise and VAT reliefs in respect of equipment and fuel used by rescue craft.</p>

Should she decide not to return to work before 31 December 2004 and has paid tax during the year, the taxpayer should obtain her P60 for 2004 from her employer in the new year and forward it to her local tax district where a review of her tax liability for the year will be dealt with.</p>

            <p eId="para_1649">The Dormant Accounts Act 2001 makes no distinction between accounts which predate the computerisation of bank records and accounts which were opened thereafter. Therefore, financial institutions are under a legal obligation to treat all accounts which are deemed dormant under the legislation in the same manner for the purposes of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">Part 3 of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 as amended provides for the appointment by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, of inspectors to verify compliance with the Act. These inspectors have the right to inspect and take copies of all records of the credit institutions that may relate to dormant accounts and failure to comply with the direction of an inspector is an offence. I understand IFSRA is currently putting arrangements in place in relation to this function.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">To date, I am aware of only one instance in which a credit institution disputed an amount that an individual was pursuing which involved an account that pre-dated computerisation. The issue did not revolve around the dormancy of the account but rather whether the moneys involved had been withdrawn and the account closed. The Ombudsman for Credit Institutions has made a ruling in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1657">In budget 1999, I introduced a scheme of capital allowances in respect of qualifying capital expenditure incurred on the construction, refurbishment or extension of a building, or part of a building, used as a child care facility. The allowances are also available in respect of qualifying capital expenditure incurred on the conversion of an existing building, or part of a building, for use as such a facility. The allowances apply in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 and provide for a seven year write off period at the rate of 15% in the first six years and 10% in the seventh year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">In budget 2000 I provided for accelerated capital allowances for owner operators of such facilities in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 1 December 1999. Accordingly, an owner-operator can opt to increase the 15% allowance for any year up to a maximum of 100% of the qualifying expenditure. At the same time, I provided for an initial allowance of 100% for both owner-operators and lessors of qualifying premises. A lessor — investor — can only opt to claim the full 100% in year one instead of the annual allowances over seven years. Unlike the owner-operator who can avail of accelerated allowances, they have no choice regarding the percentage of allowances drawn down each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">An owner operator can set off the capital allowances against their taxable income from all sources. An investor can offset the 100% initial allowances against rental income from all sources in year one. If there is insufficient rental income in that year, the maximum that an investor can offset against non-rental income is €31,750. Thereafter, the balance of the unused capital allowances can only be off-set against rental income in the following years.</p>

Section 101 also provides that the terms of a conversion scheme shall restrict any rights conferred on members of the society entitling them to shares in the successor company, to acquire shares in the successor company in priority to other subscribers or to any distribution of the funds of the society. Such rights are restricted, in the case of those persons who become members of the society after 21 December 1988, to those members who held shares in the society throughout the period of two years, which expired with the day on which notice is given to members of the conversion resolution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1674">The Comptroller and Auditor General published in January 2002 a value for money examination of the expenditure review initiative. The examination made several recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of the review. Key recommendations included: a comprehensive strategy for the development of the review should be put in place; stronger support mechanisms and central guidance should be provided; a systematic process of quality assessment of reviews should be implemented; a formal process for monitoring review impacts should be initiated; a clear set of principles should be established enabling areas of expenditure to be prioritised and scheduled for review; review reports should be published where possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">The expenditure review process has taken on board many of the recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's study. In 2001 and 2002, the Government approved a series of reforms to the initiative on foot of a Department of Finance and expenditure review central steering committee review of the review process and taking into account the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings. These reforms included the establishment of criteria for the selection of programmes for review, the provision of dedicated central supports for the review process, a process for assessing the impact of expenditure reviews, and steps to address the cross-departmental aspects of the initiative. Arrangements for drawing up the terms of reference for reviews have been strengthened. A system of external quality assessment of reviews has operated since mid-2003 and 12 reviews have been subject to this form of assessment. An expenditure reviewers' network has been established and direct training has been provided centrally to civil servants involved in the conduct of reviews. The Government decided that completed expenditure review reports should be published by Departments and offices using their websites and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the steering committee has initiated a rolling series of meetings with secretaries general and heads of office to discuss the impact of the review in their respective Departments and offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">The initiative has enabled greater attention to be directed to the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of programmes and areas reviewed as well as helping to foster the development of an evaluation culture within Departments and offices. The steering committee is preparing a progress report on the initiative since 2002 which will be broadly along the lines suggested in paragraph 4.55 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p>

            <p eId="para_1682">I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative was to review all expenditure programmes over a three-year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-01 found that this target had been over ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the initiative in 2001, which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i> inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, namely, that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the steering committee asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments and offices should select a few programmes or areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments and offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">My Department, as part of the first round of the initiative, reviewed the grant-in-aid to the Economic and Social Research Institute. In the current round of the initiative the areas of expenditure of my Department in respect of which an expenditure review has not yet been completed and published include ongoing expenditure reviews of the grant-in-aid to the Institute of Public Administration; payments to the promoters of certain charitable lotteries; the change management fund; and the Information Society. Planned expenditure reviews include consultancies; the grant-in-aid to the Economic and Social Research Institute which was reviewed in 1997 as part of the first round of the review; and the grant-in-aid to Ordnance Survey Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">It should be noted that EU programmes are subject to their own reviews, including evaluation by independent consultants and a review process with the European Commission led by the Department of Finance. These programmes are not therefore included in the review process. Several programmes have not been included in the review process because of the low level of funding involved, for example, expenditure of €120,000 in respect of committees and commissions. Other programme areas such as the child care initiative and procurement management reform were not included in the current round of reviews because, when the Department's review plan was being formulated, they were at too early a stage to review. These programmes will, however, be considered for future review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1688">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a certificate for a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny was issued by them to the sheriff in Waterford on 30 October 2002. The certificate related to an under payment of income tax in the amount of €2,191.78, and interest thereon of €2,317.69 for the 1993-94 tax year. The income tax liability was based on a return of income submitted by the person. The certificate was issued to the sheriff as a result of the failure of the person to pay the full amount of income tax due for that year. Revenue made several requests for payment to the person prior to the issue of the certificate to the sheriff. These notifications contained clear warnings of interest charges on unpaid tax and of the possibility that continued non-payment would lead to enforcement action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">The Revenue Commissioners also advise that on 4 November 2002 the sheriff issued a demand for payment of the tax and interest liabilities, together with sheriff fees and expenses, to the person. On 8 April 2003 payment of the total amount due, including a sum of €860.65 for sheriff fees and expenses, was made to the sheriff. Payment of these amounts has fully cleared the liabilities due by the person for that year. Consequently, the Revenue Commissioners advise that no refund is due to the person.</p>

            <p eId="para_1691">The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they have reviewed the taxpayer's liability for the years 1998-99 to date. As her income exceeded the exemption limits for the years in question, she is liable to pay tax on her income, including her pensions, for those years. Under payments of tax arose for the years 1998-99 to 2002. A review of her tax liability for the year 2003 has shown an over payment. When this over payment is set against the under payment for previous years, there is still a small liability. The Revenue Commissioners do not propose to pursue this.</p>

            <p eId="para_1693">Soft drinks, fruit juices and bottled water are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 21%. Alcoholic beverages are subject to excise duties. VAT applies to alcoholic beverages at the standard rate. Under Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states are permitted to apply a reduced rate of not less than 5% to food and non-alcoholic beverage items. It would be possible therefore to apply our reduced rate of 13.5% to all soft drinks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">There is no evidence to suggest that if the VAT rate on soft drinks was reduced to 13.5% that consumers would benefit from reduced prices in pubs for such products. Such a VAT reduction, even if passed on, would result in a relatively small price change. In addition, a reduction in the rate of VAT on soft drinks would be costly to the Exchequer. Even if there was a reduction in the price of soft drinks, arising from a VAT change, there is no evidence that this would have any impact on consumption of alcohol, or encourage a move away from alcoholic drinks. I have no plans, therefore, to introduce the change proposed by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1773">Ireland, together with its EU partners, welcomes the progress Indonesia has made in its democratic reform process. We recognise the importance of the elections to the Legislature, held in April 2004, and the forthcoming presidential elections, to be held in July 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">While acknowledging Indonesia's legitimate concern to preserve its territorial integrity, we continue to encourage the Government of that country to strengthen its efforts to address the legitimate aspirations of the people of Papua. A balanced way forward would involve good governance and more control of the land and resources for their own benefit by the local population. In this regard, I welcomed the decision in August 2003 of the Government of Indonesia to suspend the implementation of the presidential decree dividing Papua into three provinces. I regret, however, that this suspension has been described by the Government of Indonesia as temporary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">At the April 2003 meeting of the EU External Relations Council, Ireland, together with its EU partners, adopted Council conclusions on Indonesia. These confirmed the EU's support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia and stressed the importance of the full implementation, in both letter and spirit, of the special autonomy law in Papua. This law, which dates from November 2001 but has not yet been fully implemented, provides for a greater degree of autonomy for Papua than for Indonesia's other provinces. Subsequently, in January 2004 the External Relations Council adopted conclusions on South East Asia which reiterated our commitment to the territorial integrity of countries in that region, to a democratic and stable region and to the promotion of human rights, democratic principles and good governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">As a demonstration of our commitment as Presidency to raise the level of our political dialogue with Indonesia, I led an EU ministerial Troika meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, on 18 April last. This was the first meeting at this level between the EU Presidency and Indonesia in a number of years. In particular, I used the occasion to express the EU's continuing concerns about the situation in Papua. Minister Wirajuda took note of our concerns and expressed his belief that the special autonomy law will satisfy the aspirations of the overwhelming majority of the people in Papua. I made it clear that we would carefully monitor the situation in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">Ireland, together with its EU partners, will continue to support the development of a strengthened partnership and effective dialogue between the EU and Indonesia. The Government sees this as the most effective framework at this time for addressing our serious concerns about the situation in Papua.</p>

The Department of Foreign Affairs is working with the Reach agency to offer the Department's services capable of electronic delivery through this single point of contact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">The Reach agency intends to launch the first stage of the public services broker at the end of this month. This will be a public facing website, to be known as <i>reachservices.ie</i>, designed to act as a single point of access to a range of services offered by the Irish public service. Initially, <i>reachservices.ie</i> will provide access in the form of links to forms or on-line services provided on other websites, including those of the Department of Foreign Affairs. It will provide access to information and application forms for up to 900 services at time of launch.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">Future releases of the public services broker will include facilities for registration and authentication of customer identity, address validation, the pre-population of forms with previously registered data and an e-payments facility. Another important facility will be the capability for developing and hosting on-line interactive forms which will be offered to Departments and Agencies that are developing on-line services for their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">As there are considerable complexities associated with the requirement of customers to provide photographs and signatures in a secure authenticated electronic form, the services delivered by the Department of Foreign Affairs are not easily delivered via electronic channels. The Reach agency has informed the Department that the functionality required to securely accept, authenticate, store and protect the photographs and signatures required for Departmental services will not be available until later releases of the broker.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">Pending the delivery by the Reach agency of a fully functional public services broker, the Department is examining the feasibility of making certain passport services available electronically. The Department is considering the feasibility of offering a passport application tracking system and a partial on-line application system over the Internet. Decisions on the feasibility of delivering these services electronically will be made later this year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1788">I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three-year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance-expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a value for money study of the ERI, carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2001, which proposed that a more realistic target should be set which would take into account the level of evaluative capacity in departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">In June 2001, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics, based on specific selection criteria — that is, that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas or involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002 the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003 the central steering committee asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments-offices should select a small number of programmes or areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments and offices. Details of expenditure reviews undertaken by my Department are set out in the appendix.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">In addition to reviews under the public expenditure review process, operations and programmes administered by my Department are subject to a range of evaluation mechanisms. The inspection and internal audit unit of the Department conducts regular reviews of services and programmes within the Department with a view to assessing their effectiveness and value for money. In addition, the evaluation and audit unit of Development Co-operation Ireland conducts a schedule of evaluations designed to determine the efficiency of programmes, identify areas for improvement and enable lessons to be learned. Most such evaluations are undertaken by external consultants in co-operation with staff of the unit. Ireland also participates in joint donor evaluation of programmes — often under the umbrella of the OECD's development assistance committee — and has access to a wide range of reviews and evaluations undertaken by other bilateral and multilateral donors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1807">Trócaire's document, The Zimbabwean Struggle: Obstacles to Democracy, is a welcome addition to the debate on Zimbabwe. Central to this report are recommendations for the EU to condemn draconian legislation in Zimbabwe, for intensive engagement with Zimbabwe's southern African neighbours and for continued humanitarian aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">The EU has continually expressed its serious concern at the deteriorating political and human rights in Zimbabwe. A major priority of Ireland's EU Presidency has been the promotion of African issues on the EU agenda, which includes a concentration on the current Zimbabwean crisis. In February 2004 the EU's Common Position on Zimbabwe noted the worsening human rights environment in that country. Faced with this scenario, the Council renewed sanctions on those individuals whom the EU regards as bearing the main responsibility for serious violations of human rights in Zimbabwe. The sanctions are targeted against the political elite and include a travel ban and an assets freeze, as well as an arms embargo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">The Council also expressed its deep concern at legislation in Zimbabwe, which seriously infringes citizens' right to freedom of association and assembly, namely the Public Order and Security Act, POSA. Concern was similarly expressed regarding the application and provisions of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, AIPPA, which denies freedom of expression and restricts freedom of the press. The Council also deplored the consistent undermining of the independence of the judiciary by the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">With regard to intensive pressure on neighbouring countries in southern Africa, this is a policy that has been pursued vigorously by the EU and by Ireland in its bilateral relations. The EU raised its profound concerns regarding Zimbabwe at both the EU-Africa and the EU-South Africa ministerial Troika meetings in Dublin on 1 and 2 April of this year. I also raised the Zimbabwe issue bilaterally in my meetings with President Chissano of Mozambique, current chair of the African Union, and President Mbeki of South Africa last November. The Irish Presidency arranged for the EU's Common Position on Zimbabwe to be formally communicated to all members of the Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. We also reiterated our willingness to engage with the Government of Zimbabwe on the basis of an established set of governance centred benchmarks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The EU is strongly committed to the welfare of the Zimbabwean people, as evidenced by its donation of €294 million of humanitarian assistance to the citizens of Zimbabwe over the 2002-03 period. Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, has also made €8 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance available for the affected countries in southern Africa, of which €3 million went directly to Zimbabwe. In 2003 DCI also provided funding of more than €2 million to five development projects in Zimbabwe. All of this aid is channelled through the World Food Programme, UNICEF, the Red Cross and other international NGOs.</p>

It has been necessary to consider these issues with the Department of Finance and we are in ongoing consultation with them in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">The Department has also recently inspected a site in Limerick city proposed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, as the location for the new premises for the development co-operation directorate. Certain issues arising from that inspection remain to be addressed with the OPW. The suitability, or otherwise, of the site will have a major bearing on the timescale for completion of the decentralisation, and therefore on the implementation plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">In light of that, it was not feasible for this Department to meet the time frame recommended in the report of the decentralisation implementation group for submission of implementation plans. The plan is now being finalised by a committee, comprising mainly representatives of the Department's corporate services and development co-operation divisions, and has not necessitated the diversion of staff resources from other work. I am confident the plan will be submitted to the Department of Finance within the next ten days.</p>

In my combined reply to this and a number of related questions, I indicated that the Department's annual report would take account of the Department's decentralisation implementation plan which would, in turn, address issues such as service and business continuity, efficiency and effectiveness and financial implications and would incorporate specific risk assessment and mitigation strategies. I also indicated there was a high level of awareness in the Department of Foreign Affairs of the types of risks identified in paragraph 6.31 of the Report of the Working Group on the Accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers, the Mullarkey report, and that the Department's implementation plan would be submitted to me prior to its transmission to the decentralisation implementation group.</p>

            <p eId="para_1824">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">The board has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and a management team of eight staff. To date, 62 educational welfare staff have been appointed. I understand the board will soon make a further EWO appointment which will bring the service delivery staff to its authorised complement of 63 service delivery staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an educational welfare service is now available, for the first time, in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. Twelve towns with significant school going populations, 11 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">In July 2004, the board will receive the first comprehensive data returns from schools and these will assist it in keeping the level of need for the new service in particular areas under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">The NEWB has indicated that it is not aware of the circumstances of the case raised by the Deputy. However, the board has indicated that it is prepared to meet the Deputy to hear his concerns and to see how best it can respond.</p>

My Department has been in contact with Bus Éireann who has confirmed that as the pupil's residence, in this case, is within 15 miles of Gaelcholaiste Chiarraí, Tralee, the nearest all-Irish medium post-primary school, the pupil concerned does not qualify for a boarding grant under the terms of the remote area grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">It has been intimated that an exemption be given to the pupil in this case in respect of the remote area grant scheme on the basis that the nearest all-Irish school appears not to be offering the prescribed certified course in two specific subject areas. This is neither a reasonable nor tenable basis to justify granting the exemption in question. In this case, my Department's responsibility to provide an all-Irish medium post-primary education is satisfied through Gaelcholaiste Chiarraí.

            <p eId="para_1851">The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.

The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding his or her entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</p>

            <p eId="para_1879">Children with dyslexia are generally catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. The Deputy may be interested to know that my Department is currently developing a weighted system of allocation of teaching support for schools to cater for pupils with special needs, including those with dyslexia. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: (a) making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and (b) making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will: reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests.

My Department assigned it a band 4 rating in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">Indicative timescales were included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the schools building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme, including the school in question. I will make a further announcement during the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2140">Under the rules of my Department pupils in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day. It is a matter for a school's board of management to decide whether the concession should be applied. If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day their parents should be notified and invited to collect them at the time of dismissal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">In the event that parents cannot collect their children on a particular day due to exceptional, unforeseen circumstances then the children must be supervised in school up to the time school ends or until they are transferred into the care of a nominated adult.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">Schools that have notified parents of their policy would be entitled to expect that parents would comply with the stated policy. It is acknowledged that particular circumstances can arise whereby the implementation of the shorter school day for pupils in infant classes can cause difficulties for some parents. This can be especially so where, for instance, parents have other children in senior classes in the school who would not be finished until one hour after the infant classes have concluded. In such cases parents are required to undertake two return journeys within the space of an hour if the school policy is strictly implemented. Difficulties may also arise due to the organisation of the school transport system where children are only collected at the end of the school day.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">In such situations parents should contact the board of management and explain the difficulties that they will encounter if the school policy is strictly implemented. My Department requests schools to take a sympathetic approach to cases where the strict implementation of the policy would cause genuine difficulties for parents.</p>

The working group's initial consideration of the detailed implementation issues that arise for medical education will also inform my approach to the proposed later introduction of changes for the other health disciplines.

            <p eId="para_2238">Under the terms of the schemes mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</p>
            <p eId="para_2239">When assessing the means of students, other than independent mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.

            <p eId="para_2249">My Department has no record of receiving a petition. Applications for special education resources were submitted. More than 5,000 SER applications were received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 and are being considered. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September. All of them were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service.

            <p eId="para_2251">The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. My Department will complete the process as quickly as possible and my officials will respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03 that was issued in September 2003. The circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2252">Teacher resources for applicant schools will be based on a new weighted system of allocation that I announced recently. It is part of an additional allocation of 350 teaching posts and will involve two elements, making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2253">It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, including the applications from the school in question, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2263">Recently my Department received an application for special needs assistant and resource teaching support for the pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">More than 5,000 SER applications were received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 and they are being considered. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September. All of these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and NEPS. The applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys on SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. My Department shall complete the process as quickly as and my officials will respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03 that was issued last September. It contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within a school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">Teacher resources for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation that I announced recently. The system, as part of an additional allocation of 350 teaching posts, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2268">It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2271">The joint programme for Government undertook to provide financial support to schools for the purpose of age related literacy tests to enable teachers to measure the progress of students and to use the results of the tests to inform their subsequent planning and teaching.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">Following the introduction of the revised curriculum to schools in 1999, a number of changes were made to the English curriculum in primary schools. As a result test providers revised their standardised reading literacy tests in English. One of the test publishers has completed the test revision and another will publish a new reading literacy test in February 2006. I propose to consider the question of supporting schools to purchase the tests when all of the revised standardised reading literacy tests in English become available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2274">In May 2003 I announced a package of measures costing €42 million aimed at improving the student support systems, with particular emphasis on providing support to those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The latest figures indicate that the number of people who benefited from the special rate of maintenance, or top-up grants, in the academic year 2003-2004 is in the region of 10,700.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275">In addition the Government, with assistance from the European Social Fund, provides funding through my Department for a number of initiatives to increase participation in further and higher education from students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2276">Last year I also announced the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority, proposed by the action group on access to third level education. The national office is fully operational since February 2004. Its remit is to facilitate inclusive and equitable access to higher education from under represented groups and promote improved participation by students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, students with a disability and mature second chance students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2277">It must recommend a possible national strategy to me that will achieve a significant improvement in equity of access to higher education. It must undertake a review of the effectiveness of existing measures and programmes. It will suggest, if necessary, a more structured approach to the allocation of funding for future years that will result in measurable improvements in line with our overall objective of promoting greater equity of access to third level education, through improved targeting of student support access initiatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_2333">The electronic delivery of services through a single point of contact is being progressed through the framework of the public services broker and the Reach agency is charged with responsibility for its design and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">I intend to launch the first stage of the public services broker at the end of this month. This will be a public website and will be known as <i>reachservices.ie</i>. It will be designed to act as a single point of access to a range of services offered by the Irish public service. Initially the website will provide access in the form of links to forms or online services provided on other websites. It will provide access to information and application forms for up to 900 services at the time of its launch. The range of services accessible through the website will continue to be expanded until it provides a comprehensive index to the range of publicly provided services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">In parallel, Reach is working to provide essential online capabilities for the benefit of customers and public service providers. These capabilities will include an integration framework that will allow for the secure electronic transmission and exchange of service requests. My Department is examining the possible use of the framework for automating the receipt and matching of death notices from the general registrar's office, and the location and validation of personal public service numbers in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">Reach is also developing facilities for the registration and authentication of customer identity, address validation, the pre-population of forms with previously registered data and an electronic payments facility. Another important facility is the capability for developing and hosting online interactive forms that will be offered to Departments and agencies that are developing online services for their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">Reach is in discussion with a number of Departments and agencies, including my Department, about a range of online services that will be launched with the next phase of the development of <i>reachservices.ie</i> in the autumn.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2340">I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 287 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. A review of the process by the Department of Finance-expenditure review central steering committee in 2000 and 2001 found that the target had been over ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. The view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the ERI in 2001. He proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria. In other words, that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas and involve a significant level of expenditure. In May 2002 the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three year planning horizon, 2002 to 2004, inclusive, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">In April 2003 the ERCSC, in consultation with the Department of Finance, asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans. The committee emphasised the Government's selection criteria and advised that Departments and offices should select a small number of programmes or areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of the process my Department drew up revised expenditure review plans in consultation with the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">Since the inception of the ERI in 1997 my Department has completed expenditure reviews on the following topics: primary education, Institiuid Teangeolaíochta Éireann and the home-school-community liaison scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">As part of the ERI's 2002-2004 phase a number of reviews are nearing completion. They are as follows: supply panel for primary teaching that was finished and quality assessed according to ERI procedures; operation of the education centres that are being assessed; and youth encounter projects that is due for completion before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">In response to the above mentioned request of April 2003 to update our reviews plans, a number of topics were considered. The following reviews were agreed and are scheduled for completion in the current phase of the ERI: first and second level schools building programmes; schools ICT programmes; expenditure on guidance services; and ICT undergraduate skills programmes and in career development.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2353">My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low income families in schools at first and second level. For the purposes of the scheme a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, that would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">In 1993 my Department received a consultancy report that dealt with the factors that contribute to the cost of school textbooks. Its main conclusion was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting cost of school books to parents. Copies of the report were sent to all schools. It contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">School authorities were advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. Textbooks must be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">I am satisfied that the problem of disposal of unwanted textbooks is minimised because many schools operate book rental schemes and second-hand book exchanges. Locally operated schemes are the appropriate and efficient way to address the issue. There are no proposals to introduce a pilot scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2370">I can confirm that my Department has received an application for resource teaching support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The position is that applications for special educational resources, SER, received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the application in question are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24-03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school. In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements, making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2510">My Department has received an application for resource teaching support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The position is that applications for special educational resources, SER, received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the application in question, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24-03, which issued in September 2003.

            <p eId="para_2540">The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners. The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2003 was 74 pupils. This enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2004-05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2541">The agreement referred to above can only be deviated from when a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. Rapid growth is defined as an increase in its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 25 pupils plus a stipulated excess of five pupils on the appointment figure. For this school to be considered for developing school status the school would require a minimum enrolment of 99 pupils on 30 September 2004. Unfortunately, an additional mainstream teacher cannot be sanctioned under any other circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2542">If the board of management of the school feel that the enrolment of the school will increase to a minimum of 99 pupils by 30 September 2004, it may apply for a post under the developing school criteria as outlined in Department circular 03-04.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">To ensure transparency and openness in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide any mainstream staffing appeals. Details of the appeals board are outlined in Department circular 03-04. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</p>

            <p eId="para_2563">In July 2003, Drogheda Port Company applied to my Department for my consent under section 15(3) of the Harbours Act 1996 to the reservation of a rent below open market rent obtainable for land at Mornington, County Meath. The company informed my Department that it had agreed to lease the land to Coastwatch Ireland Limited for 999 years at a peppercorn rent. In October 2003, the company provided further information to my Department relevant to its request.</p>
            <p eId="para_2564">My Department has not yet completed its consideration of the company's request, principally because the company has indicated that the lease of this land takes place in the wider context of the application to the Boyne Estuary Special Protection Area of the provisions of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. This has given rise to the need for additional consultation which my Department is pursuing at present with a view to finalising the matter at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_2566">The latest statistics published by the OECD on broadband access, which date from June 2003, show Ireland with 0.41 per 100 inhabitants compared with the OECD figure of 6.06. The most recent European Commission data, from May 2004, indicates a penetration rate of 0.9% of the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2567">Broadband access in Ireland has been increasing dramatically in recent months, so these figures may not reflect the current level of broadband penetration here. For example, the number of DSL broadband customers in Ireland grew from 1,000 in May 2003 to over 44,000 by May 2004. In addition, the numbers availing of flat rate Internet access grew by 50,000 in the same period. In addition to these figures, 10,000 customers are now availing of corporate ultra high speed broadband, and up to 5,000 have access to broadband by wireless, cable and satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">The recent announcements of new broadband offers, with three months of free trials and start-up packages, together with the general lowering of broadband prices, will certainly help to drive broadband penetration into even more homes and businesses.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2574">I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 328 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2575">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. However, a review of the process by the expenditure review central steering committee, ERCSC, in the Department of Finance in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the expenditure review initiative in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set, taking into account the level of evaluative capacity in departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2576">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments-offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report. Subsequently, in May 2002 the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-2004, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC requested Departments-offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments-offices should select a small number of programmes-areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments-offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2577">This Department has completed six expenditure reviews from 1997 to date. Summary details are listed in the following table, together with the subheads to which each review relates. Three of the Department's reviews are being prepared for publication: BIM ice plants, fishery harbours and coast protection. It is at the discretion of the Department whether to publish these reviews and lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas since this is not required for reviews listed in the 1997-2001 phase. The reviews will be placed on the Department's Internet site, and simultaneously laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">The Department has also completed two further reviews. It is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food to publish the review of the forestry structural programme as the function transferred to that Department on 1 January 2004. The review of the inland fisheries programme will not be published until the high level review of the inland fisheries sector is completed. Both reviews have been forwarded to the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">Three other reviews are under way or about to commence, those on marine research, the national seabed survey and on alternative energy and energy conservation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2866">An application seeking grant assistance in respect of the company referred to by the Deputy was received on 18 November 2003 by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara under the EU co-funded aquaculture development measure of the Southern and Eastern, S &amp; E, and the Border Midland and Western, BMW, regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2867">The application was assessed and prioritised by BIM for Exchequer and FIFG grant assistance and BIM submitted the project to the aquaculture selection boards for the S &amp; E region and the BMW region. The application is one of a number of applications considered by the aquaculture selection boards at their meetings on 25 May. A large number of new projects were submitted involving total grant of €10.517 million. When taken together with projects previously approved, the total commitment would amount to an estimated 94% of the grant aid provided for aquaculture under the BMW regional programme and an estimated 87% for the S &amp; E regional programme, assuming all projects were approved. Taking account of the substantial level of grant aid involved, the boards did not make any decisions pending a determination on the allocations of such funding in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 financial envelopes for aquaculture development under the NDP to be provided to the Department in the Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2868">Over the coming weeks the Department will be examining the extent of financial commitments arising out of grant aid awarded to date under the scheme, and will also be examining the projected demand relating to prioritised projects in the context of available funding for 2005 and subsequent years. Decisions on the processing of the applications under the measures will be made in light of the outcome of this exercise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2869">On regional advisory councils, these are stakeholder-led organisations and include representation of all the interests affected by the Common Fisheries Policy, while recognising the primacy of fishing interests given the effects on them of management decisions and policies. I am satisfied that the interests of the aquaculture sector can be effectively represented in the councils and I am pleased that the sector is actively interested in getting involved in the work of the councils.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_2873">I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 to 333, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2874">Private sector involvement in the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP, is just one of a number of issues being considered in the context of an expenditure review of the programme, which is currently under way in my Department. This review is due to be completed later this year. The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government is represented on the expenditure review group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">At the moment, the various arrangements and accompanying guidelines in place for public private partnership, PPP, are geared towards major and complex capital projects with significant ongoing maintenance requirements, that is, projects having a capital cost of €20 million or more. The advice is that the PPP model should only be used where it is appropriate and where it can deliver value for money. Conversely, it would not be appropriate where the transaction costs of pursuing a PPP are disproportionate to the value of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">The policy framework for PPP schemes in the local government sector issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in November last, and implementing guidelines from the Department of Finance, are detailed and complex, in implementation terms. The scale of project costs in the LASPP are in the region of €8 million and would not be seen, therefore, as being of sufficiently high cost to justify the extra resources involved in pursuing a formal PPP approach. Indeed, the Department of Finance confirmed some time ago that there were several considerations which would militate against a PPP approach in this programme and that pool projects do not strictly comply with the definition of a viable PPP in terms of scale and optimal transfer of risk to the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">Where local authorities require to raise loans, section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, allows for borrowing of money by local authorities, subject to ministerial approval. In the case of borrowings in respect of local authority swimming pool projects, my Department seeks advice from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the ability of the relevant local authority to repay the loan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">It is important to bear in mind that the LASPP is merely a grant scheme and it is a matter for local authorities to devise funding and operational arrangements as they see fit, to complement the grant element. Experience shows that there is potential for private sector involvement in the provision and operation of local authority swimming pool facilities and many local authorities are exploring various ways of involving the private sector in their projects. From my Department's perspective, there is no objection to the involvement of the private sector provided the generally accepted operational considerations of a public pool form part of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">The expenditure review of the LASPP, which is underway in my Department, will input into the formulation of future policy in this area. This review is examining, among other things, how the existing programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued where pools have been built and what changes, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme.</p>

     <b>Mr. Wall</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
     the assessment his Department has made in regard to swimming pools in the country in relation to refurbishment or replacement or the provision of new pools; the number of applications with his Department with regard to the provision of new pools; the number in regard to the replacement of existing pools; if there is a priority list in regard to such lists; if so, if such a list is available; the way in which it can be obtained; the effect which an area or town with designated RAPID status has on such assessments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_582">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_2881">My Department has commenced an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme, the outcome of which will be used to assist in formulating future policy. This review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to areas where pools have been built and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. It is hoped to have this review completed later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2882">The closing date for receipt of applications under the current round of the local authority swimming pool programme was 31 July 2000 and since then 55 applications have or are being dealt with under the programme. Of these applications, 17 are for new pools in greenfield sites, 24 for replacement pools and 14 for the refurbishment of existing pools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">Under the programme, there are four principal stages in the approval process of a swimming pool project: feasibility study-preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. Grant-aid is only approved when the tender is approved for a project and is at a grant rate of 80% of the eligible cost of the project. Projects developed in areas designated as disadvantaged, however, qualify for financial support at 90% subject, in both cases, to a maximum grant of €3.8 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2884">Because of the long lead-time associated with swimming pool projects, it can take some time for projects to proceed through the various stages of development. Of the 55 projects: 13 swimming pool projects have been opened or have completed construction work; five projects are at construction phase; 37 other applications are at various stages in the process; four are at tender stage; 18 are at contract document stage; and 15 are at preliminary report stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2885">Projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and consideration is given to such issues as to whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties. The Department's annual Estimates provision for the programme has a significant influence on the approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2886">As the Deputy will be aware, the Revitalising Areas through Planning, Investment and Development — RAPID — programme aims to target the most disadvantaged areas of the country for enhanced development. No additional funding has been set aside for the programme but rather these areas are prioritised for support within existing budgets.</p>

The deed of covenant and charge is invoked by my Department’s legal advisers, the Chief State Solicitor’s office, CSSO.

            <p eId="para_2903">I propose to take questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2904">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance expenditure review central steering committee, ERCSC, in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the ERI in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2905">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments-offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, that is, that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon — 2002-04 — and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC asked Departments-offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments-offices should select a small number of programmes-areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments-offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2906">My Department's updated expenditure review plan for 2003 and 2004 includes five reviews as follows: the sports capital programme expenditure review is currently being finalised; the swimming pools programme expenditure review is proceeding; the sports tourism initiative expenditure review has been deferred pending consideration by the Department of the outcome of the review of the initiative currently being conducted by Fáilte Ireland; and expenditure reviews of the Irish Sports Council and the Irish Film Board are due to be undertaken in 2004.</p>

That review was undertaken on the basis of safety concerns relating to those products. The board actively participated in that review, which involved a complete benefit-risk re-assessment, and concluded that the benefit-risk profile of products containing paroxetine remains positive. Several recommendations were made for inclusion on the product's licence documents, the purpose of which was to harmonise the information on those products across member states. I am informed that the majority of those recommendations are already reflected on the licence documentation currently approved in Ireland. That documentation includes special warnings and precautions for use, particularly regarding the need for close monitoring of patients using medicinal products containing paroxetine.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3173">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards or authority in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3174">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Northern Area Health Board, or NAHB, area of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, or ERHA, and on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3175">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. Those 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics, including five from the ERHA. Those measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3176">Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. That appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of that post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school further to substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. That project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</p>
            <p eId="para_3177">Orthodontic initiative funding of €2.044 million was provided to the ERHA in 2001, and that has enabled the authority to recruit additional staff and build additional orthodontic facilities. The authority has developed additional orthodontic facilities at Loughlinstown, Ashtown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3178">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund towards the treatment of persons on the orthodontic waiting lists; the ERHA received €1.815 million from that fund. My Department instructed the health boards and authority that the funding was to be allocated on the basis of the following principles: treatment of clients longest on the waiting list in accordance with the severity of their treatment need; allocation to provide additional treatment over and above what was provided in the normal way; efficiency and value for money; and equitable delivery across health board populations. The regional chief executive of the ERHA has informed my Department of the following information on the NAHB treatment waiting list at the end of March 2004:</p>

            <p eId="para_3198">National policy on the treatment of alcohol abuse, as set out in Planning for the Future, stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol-related problems should be on community-based intervention. Health boards already provide and continue to develop a range of comprehensive community-based support services appropriate to the needs of persons affected and afflicted by alcohol abuse. Those services include family support and community, medical and social services in the management of the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">The main therapeutic tools in the treatment of alcohol dependence are psychotherapy, counselling, and family and marital therapy, either individually or in group settings. Therapy may take place in a residential or a day setting. As alcohol-related problems occur, in many instances, in local and family settings, the community-based response can be direct and early, thereby reducing the associated levels of physical, psychological and social problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3200">The health promotion unit of my Department is involved in a range of initiatives aimed at preventing and reducing alcohol-related harm. One such initiative was the establishment of a strategic task force on alcohol in January 2002 to recommend evidence-based measures to Government, aimed at reducing and preventing alcohol-related harm. Following a comprehensive review of the most effective alcohol policy measures by international experts, an interim report was published in May 2002. A second report, containing further recommendations, will be published in the near future. An interdepartmental group has been established to co-ordinate responses to the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3201">The health promotion unit of my Department has provided funding to the Irish College of General Practitioners, or ICGP, to implement an alcohol-aware practice project. The main aim of the project is to assist the GP to be more effective in helping patients with alcohol problems.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3204">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1 — i.e. medical card holders — or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3205">Persons in category 1 are medical card holders, and they are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services, including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3206">Persons in category 2, that of non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants' services and out-patient public hospital services, including consultants' services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is €45 per night, up to a maximum of €450 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of €45 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. That charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">Under the Health Act 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, and neither I nor my Department have a function in the matter. Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment. I would like to add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_3208">Persons suffering from specified conditions, including acute leukaemia, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme. There are no plans at this time to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with other forms of cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3209">Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a total cumulative investment of €550 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. The benefit of that investment is reflected in the significant increase in staffing and activity which has occurred. For example, the investment has enabled the funding of an additional 91 consultant posts in key areas of cancer care such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care and general surgeons with a special interest in breast surgery. In addition approximately €90 million has been invested in oncology infrastructure, including specialist equipment in radiation oncology, mammography, radiology and pathology. The recruitment and training of specialist staff and the utilisation of equipment is a matter for individual health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, or ERHA.</p>

            <p eId="para_3225">Assessments for inter-country and domestic adoptions are carried out by health boards or by registered adoption societies. At the outset of the process, applicants are placed on a health board or adoption society waiting list for assessment. The waiting list for assessment varies throughout the country. The assessment process itself involves a number of stages and would generally include an initial assessment, a considerable level of education or preparation work, including an exploration with prospective adoptive parents of the challenges and issues likely to arise when undertaking adoption, and a home study assessment. The purpose of the assessment process is to determine whether applicants are suitable to adopt a child, and the length of the process can vary between applicants, depending on the particular circumstances of each case, bearing in mind at all times the best interests of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_3226">An applicant's file is sent to the Adoption Board when the process is nearing finalisation.

            <p eId="para_3238">The cost to the end of May 2004 of the Dunne inquiry is €15.3 million. The inquiry, under its terms of reference, will investigate and report on the issue of the possible sale of body parts either within or outside the country. I am informed that senior counsel on the inquiry team are working full-time on the business of the inquiry apart from a very few exceptional outstanding cases with which they must deal. There is no judge assigned to the inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3239">I await the chairman's report on the paediatric hospitals. The chairman has informed me that, with some exceptions, the information gathering regarding paediatric hospitals is complete, and the issue of analysing the information and establishing which matters remain in dispute has been concluded. The inquiry must now deal with the resolution of matters in dispute and the conclusion of the report. That involves: communication to participants of matters in dispute; written evidence regarding matters in dispute; such oral hearings as are necessary regarding matters in dispute; resolution of such matters; and the opportunity for participants to make submissions where the report proposes to make criticisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3240">The inquiry further advises that it has at all times kept in mind the need to be in a position to proceed with its work regarding the maternity hospitals as soon as the paediatric hospitals report has been completed. The inquiry has therefore continued to work in that regard to ensure that all documentation will be available to the inquiry when required. Preparation for reports on other hospitals continues, but the primary concern of the inquiry at present is the completion of the report on paediatric hospitals.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3257">The bilateral agreement between Ireland and Vietnam was negotiated by officials of the Adoption Board and my Department in March 2003. It was signed in September and ratified on 31 March 2004. In November 2003, following the signing of the agreement, the Adoption Board sent a list of issues to be clarified to the Vietnamese authorities, including Vietnamese requirements regarding facilitation for Irish applications. However, the authorities were not able to respond until the agreement had been ratified by both parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">On 5 April 2004, immediately following ratification, the Irish ambassador to Vietnam met the authorities to open discussions on implementation of the agreement and to present the issues raised by the Adoption Board. A delegation from the Adoption Board travelled to Vietnam on 19 April to meet the officials of the new adoption authority which has just been set up in Vietnam to oversee inter-country adoption, to agree operational details with them and to visit several orphanages. The Vietnamese authorities identified their requirements, which included the nomination by the Irish Adoption Board of a facilitator whom they would approve.</p>
            <p eId="para_3259">The delegation met possible candidates for that position and provided them with a document setting out the board's requirements and standards for the post. There was significant lobbying here and in Vietnam. Interested parties were invited to apply and given time to consider the requirements of the post. Following receipt of applications, the Adoption Board established an interview board on 12 May to interview the three candidates who presented themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">The Adoption Board was correctly determined to hold an independent selection procedure which would result in a candidate being selected who would best meet the requirements of the Vietnamese and Irish authorities. The Vietnamese authorities were advised of the board's nominee the next day, after the Adoption Board had approved the nominee. Under the bilateral agreement it is a matter for the Vietnamese sovereign authorities to approve the nominee. Their approval is awaited.</p>
            <p eId="para_3261">Ireland is a signatory to the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption. The Adoption Board's procedures must conform to the spirit and letter of that convention, which puts the best interest of the child at the centre of the process. I am very satisfied that the board has been exemplary and timely in its procedures.</p>

            <p eId="para_3315">The main service provided directly to members of the public by my Department is the provision of life event — births, deaths and marriages — certificates by the General Register Office. Significant computerisation has taken place regarding that process over the last few years in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, particularly with the launch of the civil registration IT system in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3316">The new civil registration IT system is currently being rolled out to registration offices throughout the country. The Civil Registration Act 2004, which was enacted in February 2004, provides the legislative basis for all remaining aspects of the modernised civil registration service. The new electronic civil registration service provides information systems, procedures to facilitate the electronic registration of vital events including births, stillbirths, deaths and marriages, and the electronic production of certificates. Historic records held by the General Register Office and the associated indices have, as part of the overall modernisation programme, been converted to an electronic format in a separate project in Roscommon. That allows certificates to be obtained at offices throughout the country rather than in the registration district where the event occurred or the General Register Office as heretofore. Following roll-out of the system, a person will also be able to register a birth, death or marriage at any registrar's office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">The implementation of a modern civil registration service is at the heart of providing better public services to citizens through the Government's modernisation programme. It is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery and e-government objectives of providing more convenient access to services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">The General Register Office is working with Reach, the public service broker, towards the introduction of on-line applications for certificates of entries in the registers of births, deaths and marriages, which will be made available when Reach launches the next phase of development of <i>reachservices.ie</i> in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">In the meantime, application forms for certificates may be downloaded from the General Register Office website, <i>www.groireland.ie</i>. In addition, applications may be faxed to the General Register Office, and payment may be made by credit card. It is intended to launch the first stage of the public services broker at the end of this month, allowing for access to downloadable application forms for life event certificates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">In addition, I have recently announced the launch of a project to provide for a health portal, to be known as <i>healthireland.ie</i>, the Irish health services on-line facility, which will allow for the development of a single standardised delivery mechanism for information and services in the context of the health reform programme. That is being done in full consultation with <i>reachservices.ie</i> to ensure a standardised approach to on-line services. The new service will be launched later in the year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3323">I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 407 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3324">As the Deputy will be aware, the initial target of the expenditure review initiative, or ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three-year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance, and the expenditure review central steering committee, or ERCSC, in 2000-01 found that the target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. That view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value-for-money study of the ERI in 2001, which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3325">In June 2001, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, i.e. that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments and offices should select a small number of programmes or areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of that process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments and offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">In the case of the Department of Health and Children, it was agreed with the Department of Finance that, in the circumstances of the health reform programme and the demands associated with its implementation, further expenditure reviews under the expenditure review initiative, or ERI, would not be initiated until 2005. However, under the Department's business plan policy review is an ongoing process. Reviews currently under way include: a strategic review of disability services; the work of the expert group on mental health services; consultant contract negotiations, which include a review of consultant provided services; an analysis by the acute hospitals review group of acute hospital services as part of preparing a national hospitals plan; and joint evaluation and review of service plan templates with the Health Board Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">In the context of the programme of expenditure reviews for 2002, the issue of an expenditure review of the general medical services scheme was raised. My Department agreed with the Department of Finance that the review of governance and accountability mechanisms in the GMS schemes being undertaken by Deloitte and Touche fulfilled the criteria of an expenditure review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">The Deloitte and Touche consultancy review of governance and accountability mechanisms in the GMS schemes was received, in draft form, by my Department in February 2003. While the review was being considered by officials in my Department, both the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, or Brennan, and the audit of structures and functions in the health system, or Prospectus, reports were published. Since the contents and recommendations of both reports are relevant to the subject matter of the GMS review, my Department requested Deloitte and Touche to update the draft in that light, also having regard to the latest financial data from the General Medical Services Payments Board. The final draft of that review has been received by my Department. It is my intention to bring that review to Government as soon as possible, at which time its publication and implementation will be discussed.</p>

            <p eId="para_3363">Under the Health Act 1970, a health board may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, as per the long-term illness scheme. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness — for people under 16 only — phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3364">Other schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the LTI can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</p>

            <p eId="para_3489">Article 17 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 provides that where the appropriate traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road by a local authority, the driver of a vehicle, the unladen weight of which exceeds the weight specified on the sign, shall not proceed beyond the sign save where it is necessary for a vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises only from that road.</p>
            <p eId="para_3490">As with all offences created under the Road Traffic Acts, the maximum fine for the commission of a first offence relating to a contravention of article 17 of the traffic and parking regulations has been increased through the Road Traffic Act 2002 from €190 to €800. Where a person is convicted of the offence on a second or subsequent occasion, a maximum fine not exceeding €1,500 can be applied. In addition however, where a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months, in addition to a maximum fine of €1,500, the court may at its discretion impose imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. The so-called on-the-spot fine system does not apply to that offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3491">The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the on-the-spot fine with the new fixed charge system. Measures to apply that system generally to a significant number of traffic and parking offences are being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The inclusion of the offence of driving a vehicle beyond specified weight signs in the new fixed charge system is being considered as part of that process.</p>

            <p eId="para_3527">PWC has assisted my Department in its analysis of financial projections and data provided both by Aer Rianta at group level and by the chairmen-designate in conjunction with local Aer Rianta management at Shannon and Cork airports. The working papers compiled by PWC do not constitute a consultancy report or study but they do contain confidential and commercially sensitive information and I will not, therefore, be publishing them. These working papers have, however, been provided to the financial advisers engaged by the ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions subject to a strict confidentiality agreement which they entered into with my Department. This sharing of key financial information with the unions' advisers was done in the context of the current engagement process between the unions and my Department which is being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3528">The work which has been done by PWC in co-operation with Aer Rianta management and its advisers has underscored the fact that there are some major challenges facing the State airports and these challenges need to be addressed. I have made it clear on numerous occasions that I believe that with a fresh start, both Shannon and Cork airports will be a commercial success and each will maximise sustainable employment both within the airport companies themselves and in their catchment areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3529">There has been a broad level of support at both national and regional level, including among business interests in the Shannon region, for the Government's decision to establish the three airports as fully autonomous authorities under State ownership. Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can perform better and each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry. I have also given repeated assurances to the ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions that there will not be any diminution in the terms and conditions of employment of workers in the company on transfer to the new independent airport authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3537">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, was to review all expenditure programmes over a three-year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-2001 found that this target had been overly ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the ERI in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3538">In June 2001, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria, namely, that programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002 to 2004, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the ERCSC asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments and offices should select a small number of programme areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments and offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3539">Since its inception in June 2002 the Department of Transport as part of the ongoing review process has completed or is in the process of completing two reviews, namely the public services obligation, PSO, funding to regional airports, which was published in March, 2004 and the review on road safety, which is ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_3541">Under the public service vehicles regulations, whenever a person requests the driver of a vehicle used as a taxi standing for hire in a taximeter area to drive him or her to a specified place in that area, the driver must comply with the request unless, <i>inter alia</i>, the person making the request fails to tender the lawful fare or the driver has another reasonable excuse for refusing or failing to comply with the request.</p>
            <p eId="para_3542">In general, each occupant of a passenger car is required to wear a safety belt or an appropriate child restraint, as the case may be. The driver of a vehicle is obliged to ensure that an occupant of the vehicle who is under 17 years of age is either restrained by an appropriate child restraint or, provided she or he is four years old and upwards, is wearing a safety belt.</p>
            <p eId="para_3543">The requirement to wear a safety belt does not apply in respect of the use of a vehicle in which the fitment of safety belts is not mandatory. However, cars registered on or after 1 January 1992 are required to have safety belts fitted to all forward facing seats. Fitment of an appropriate child restraint is not mandatory in vehicles. Accordingly, it is the duty of the driver to ensure that when a restraint is available, it is worn.</p>

            <p eId="para_3554">Where a person is detected exceeding a speed limit, he or she is offered the opportunity to pay a fixed charge. The making of such a payment is in effect a statement by the payee that he or she will not contest the accusation made in the notice, thus ensuring that the matter will not proceed to a hearing before a court.</p>
            <p eId="para_3555">Following receipt of the payment of a fixed charge in respect of a speeding offence, the licence record of the person is endorsed with two penalty points. Where a person does not pay a fixed charge, thus allowing the matter to proceed to court, on conviction he or she will be required to pay a fine of up to €800 and four penalty points will be endorsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3556">There is no basis for a refund of a fixed payment provided for in the Road Traffic Acts. As the payment of the fixed charge is a voluntary acceptance by the person that he or she has offended and is also accepting the consequences of the making of the payment, there can be no question of such a payment being refunded. The principle that a fixed charge payment cannot be refunded is provided for in section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 which provides the legislative basis for the operation of the fixed charge system. The only basis for the removal of penalty points provided for in the Act is where a court accepts a late appeal from a person convicted of a penalty point offence and, following the hearing of the appeal sets aside the original conviction. To date, no driver has had penalty points removed from their driving licence record.</p>

In support of this, she enclosed a letter from Dundalk Institute of Technology which states that she is registered as a student and that she requires the use of a car on a daily basis for transport to and from the institute. Due to the summer break, this urgency now no longer applies. The current waiting time in Mullingar is approximately 36 weeks. Urgent tests in Mullingar are being arranged within approximately ten weeks. An attempt was made to offer her an early test but the dates offered to her were unsuitable. A further date has not yet become available. It should also be noted that the person in question has already undergone two driving tests since September 2003.</p>

I am further informed that in the areas concerned, there has been no notable increase in public order incidents. I am informed that one of the persons referred to by the Deputy has been visited by the local Garda superintendent and the incident referred to discussed with him. I understand the second person referred to is visited regularly by local gardaí and that the area around his residence is frequently patrolled.</p>

            <p eId="para_3840">All deaths in prison custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a coroner's court. The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the court. The number of deaths in prison custody which are attributed to suicide are as follows: 2000, three; 2001, one; 2002, four; and 2003, two. Inquest verdicts are pending in respect of one such death in 2002 and two deaths in 2003, but the apparent cause of death indicates that suicide was the possible intention in the cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3841">Attempted suicide is also described as parasuicide. Parasuicide is any non-fatal act which an individual deliberately undertakes knowing that it may cause them physical harm or even death. Accurate historical statistical data on such incidences is not readily available and would require extensive searches of individual files and records. Such incidents have proven difficult to categorise as self-harm or attempted suicide because a judgement on intent is required from the compiler of the statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_3842">The National Suicide Research Foundation established the national parasuicide registry in 2000 as a national monitoring system for the occurrence of parasuicide. The foundation defines parasuicide as any non-fatal act which an individual deliberately undertakes knowing or believing that it may cause them physical harm or even death. It includes acts involving varying levels of suicidal intent including definite attempts at suicide and acts where the individual had no intention of dying. The Prison Service agreed with the foundation in 2001 that the registry should include prisons and places of detention in its statistics and the foundation undertook to compile the statistics from records kept within each prison or place of detention. The foundation included a chapter on prisons and places of detention in its 2002 annual report, which was published in late 2003. It recorded 144 episodes of parasuicide in prisons and places of detention in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">The Prison Service has been moving in recent years towards centralised record systems based on the use of information technology. Considerable progress has already been made in this area and further work is under way at present. The figures provided by the Prison Service relate to non-fatal acts undertaken by a prisoner knowing that they may cause physical harm or even death. The numbers of incidences of serious self-harm recorded by the Prison Service in prisons and places of detention for the specified periods are as follows: 2000, 73; 2001, 73; 2002, 93; and 2003, 112. The divergence between the figures given by the Prison Service and the national parasuicide registry for 2002 may be explained by the judgment on intent of the individual compiler of the figures in each prison and place of detention.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3845">I understand from inquiries I have made that an application from the group for a substantial capital grant of €1.5 million was submitted in May 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3846">The equal opportunities child care programme is a seven-year development programme, the progress of which was commented on favourably by the mid-term evaluators of the regional operational programmes and the national development plan. Expenditure under the programme covers the period until the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner. Grant approvals must be planned to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times. There has been great demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme. Every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private child care sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3847">On behalf of my Department, ADM Limited is conducting an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may await planning permission or the completion of tender processes before it can be reasonably assured that they will proceed. If they do not proceed, the funding set aside can be recommitted and made available to another project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3848">My Department recently reviewed the different budget lines under the equal opportunities child care programme, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. Some transfers between measures were recommended and require the approval of the regional assemblies. I expect that this technical process will be completed shortly and that it will bring to at least €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present equal opportunities child care programme. This amount includes an element for the administration by ADM Limited of the capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3849">At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about €35 million. I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitments to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline are being reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority. The review process will be repeated as necessary to maximise the benefits deriving from this phase of the equal opportunities child care programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3850">The day-to-day administration of the equal opportunities child care programme is undertaken by ADM Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments against the programme criteria of all applications for grant assistance under the programme. All large-scale capital projects are referred by ADM Limited to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter. The current review of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care places at the earliest opportunity and to ensure that the funding is drawn down in the planned manner I referred to earlier before the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3851">I do not doubt that the success of the present strand of the equal opportunities child care programme, as well as the need to continue to make child care services available to support the child care needs of our growing work force, will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from the Government for this key sector. If additional funding becomes available before the end of the present national development plan, I expect that the programme will benefit from transfers again.</p>

            <p eId="para_3855">I understand from inquiries I have made that, to date, no application for capital grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme can be traced from the group in question. If an application is received, it will undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal to ensure it meets the criteria of the programme, which include increasing the number of child care facilities and places, enhancing the quality of child care provision in the locality, allowing parents to avail of educational, training or employment opportunities and ensuring that the development of child care facilities is co-ordinated at local level where appropriate. The application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a funding recommendation before I make a final decision on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3856">It is fair to point out that there has been a high level of demand for capital grant assistance under the present strand of the equal opportunities child care programme. As a result, any capital application received at this stage might have to await a further stream of funding unless it can clearly show that it is addressing a significant gap in service availability. I advise the Deputy that the group in question received a grant towards its staffing costs, amounting to €135,999 over three years.</p>

            <p eId="para_3872">I propose to take Questions Nos. 489, 490, 492, 501, 502 and 527 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3873">The question of rates charged to commercial child care providers by local authorities is more appropriate to my colleagues, the Minister for Finance, who has responsibility for fiscal policy, and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has responsibility for the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3874">I have been advised that a parliamentary question on this issue was put to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on 26 May 2004. In his response he stated that he has: no plans at present to provide for special treatment of crèches under the Valuation Act. The Valuation Act 2001 maintained the long-standing position that commercial facilities — including child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools — are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3875">The Minister also pointed out: the rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3876">I am aware that there has recently been correspondence both with me and with my Department on this issue and I have been informed that this correspondence is being dealt with.</p>

He appealed this decision. On 11 August 1999, he was informed that the appeals authority decided to uphold the original decision and to refuse his appeal. On 18 January 2000 he was notified that the Minister was proposing to consider his deportation in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. Following consideration of the person's case file and representations submitted on his behalf, a deportation order was signed in respect of him on 6 March 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3879">Judicial review proceedings were initiated against this decision. On 18 September 2001, the person was informed that as a result of the Supreme Court judgment in the P, L &amp;  B case delivered on 30 July 2001, letters similar to that sent to his legal representative on 18 January 2000 may not have complied with the requirements of Section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999. Accordingly, the Minister revoked the deportation order signed in respect of him. The person was also notified that the Minister was proposing to make another deportation order in respect of him and that he was entitled to make additional written representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons he should be allowed leave to remain in the State. Representations have been made on the person's behalf, arguing why he should not be deported. I expect the case file to be submitted to me for consideration shortly and the man in question will be informed of my decision in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_3885">We are at the middle stage of the implementation of the successful equal opportunities child care programme, which provides grant aid, as the Deputy mentioned. The programme has three strands: capital grants for community based, not-for-profit organisations and private sector child care providers to build, renovate, upgrade or equip child care facilities; staffing grants for community groups and not-for-profit organisations which provide child care for disadvantaged families; and support to the national voluntary child care organisations and other groups which are working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland. I am happy to inform the Deputy that almost 18,000 additional child care places had come on stream by the end of 2003 as a result of the programme's support. The Deputy may be aware that the programme target is 28,000 new places by the end of 2006, so the progress to date is very satisfying.</p>
            <p eId="para_3886">There has been a significant number of applications for grant assistance under the programme. The demand for grant assistance to develop child care continues to remain buoyant. I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding available for community groups under the present strand of the programme to address the most immediate service gaps following a comparative review of all applications on hand by 30 April 2004. Applications from community groups received after that date, along with capital applications which are not deemed to be top priority for immediate funding following the present review, will be considered again for funding if additional funding becomes available under the present strand of the programme or for funding under the next programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3909">The Land Registry has made significant progress in the development and implementation of its ICT programme. A significant advance was made in providing Internet-based access and services to customers when the integrated title registration information system and the electronic access service were launched in 1999. The information system was gradually rolled out to the entire country, culminating with the final counties in October 2002. All registrations have been made on an electronic register since then. The electronic access service was the first e-government project to go live in the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">Following the early success of the electronic access service, a crucial task to be achieved was the conversion of over 110 years of historical paper records into electronic format. This work, which commenced in 2002, will be completed ahead of schedule in July 2004. Under the project some 6.4 million pages of official records were systematically scanned, indexed, checked and loaded onto the system for use by customers through the Internet. The following table, which presents a snapshot of some of the key performance indicators, shows that uptake and usage continues to grow steadily and that the volume of users and the level of transactions continue to be well ahead of projections.</p>

            <p eId="para_3928">Over 80% of the Land Registry's customer base accesses services through the electronic access service. Over 70% of applications for some services are made on-line. Approximately 3,500 on-line business transactions are conducted through the electronic access service each day. In many cases, it is possible to complete one's business entirely on-line.</p>
            <p eId="para_3929">The Land Registry's electronic access service is modelled to avail of the e-broker intermediary being developed by Reach. It is particularly intended to take advantage of the common security regime and electronic payments mechanisms which will emanate from the work of Reach. The Land Registry's electronic service delivery strategy takes into account the rapidly changing nature of technology and the evolving demands for more efficient service delivery models through the use of ICTs. The strategy includes further examination of the possibilities for delivering additional services electronically.</p>
            <p eId="para_3930">The key areas under consideration include the introduction of digital mapping, so that all map-based information can be made available electronically. The digital mapping project, which covers all the land in the State, was recently approved by the Minister for Finance for funding and preparations are under way. Liaison with the legal profession and financial institutions is ongoing, as part of attempts to extend the range of services available electronically. Options are being considered to eliminate paper-based certification from the registration process. We are contributing to the Law Reform Commission's report on the future of electronic conveyancing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3931">A number of developments are ongoing to facilitate existing service delivery on the electronic access service. The developments which have been successfully implemented or are planned for implementation during 2004 include the electronic access service website, <i>www.landregistry.ie</i>, which underwent a complete redesign and upgrade during 2003. More than 70,000 visits to the Land Registry’s homepage are made each month. Additional functional, performance and accessibility developments have been implemented which have facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the further extension of the range of services currently available through the site. A further enhancement, subject to available funding, will see the commencement of the implementation of a project — already two years at planning stage — to incorporate the information and services of the registry of deeds into the electronic access service.</p>

            <p eId="para_3933">I understand from enquiries I have made that an application from the group for a substantial capital grant of almost €1.4 million was submitted in February 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3934">The equal opportunities child care programme is a seven-year development programme, the progress of which was commented on favourably by the mid-term evaluators of the regional operational programmes and the national development plan. Expenditure under the programme covers the period until the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner. Grant approvals must be planned to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times. There has been great demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme. Every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private child care sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3935">On behalf of my Department, ADM Limited is conducting an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may await planning permission or the completion of tender processes before it can be reasonably assured that they will proceed. If they do not proceed, the funding set aside can be recommitted and made available to another project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3936">My Department recently reviewed the different budget lines under the equal opportunities child care programme, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. Some transfers between measures were recommended and require the approval of the regional assemblies. I expect that this technical process will be completed shortly and that it will bring to at least €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present equal opportunities child care programme. This amount includes an element for the administration by ADM Limited of the capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3937">At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about €35 million. I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitments to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline are being reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority. The review process will be repeated as necessary to maximise the benefits deriving from this phase of the equal opportunities child care programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3938">The day-to-day administration of the equal opportunities child care programme is undertaken by ADM Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments against the programme criteria of all applications for grant assistance under the programme. All large-scale capital projects are referred by ADM Limited to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter. The current review of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care places at the earliest opportunity and to ensure that the funding is drawn down in the planned manner I referred to earlier before the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3939">I do not doubt that the success of the present strand of the equal opportunities child care programme, as well as the need to continue to make child care services available to support the child care needs of our growing work force, will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from the Government for this key sector. If additional funding becomes available before the end of the present national development plan, I expect that the programme will benefit from transfers again.</p>

No supporting evidence of a medical condition was submitted with her application. The applicant named a reference in Ireland and indicated that she would be financially supported and accommodated by this reference during her visit, but there is no evidence of any prior existing connection between the applicant and the reference. It has also been noted that the applicant's 13 year old son is among a group due to visit Ireland around the same time as the applicant's proposed visit. The application was refused because the visa officer was not reasonably able to conclude, on the basis of the supporting documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa.</p>
            <p eId="para_3942">The applicant's reference in Ireland submitted a letter of appeal against the refusal of the visa on her behalf.

I understand the Minister for Transport will chair a meeting of the group shortly. The issue to be decided on is the solution that will give the best results in terms of a positive impact on road safety and traffic management, as well as the best value for money. The involvement of non-Garda personnel is one of the options under consideration, but it would involve substantial legal and financial implications. Issues such as the structure, functions and method of operation of a traffic corps, together with the legal basis for any civilian involvement, also require detailed consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3945">There is a dedicated traffic unit in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement.

            <p eId="para_3947">A commitment to have public services capable of electronic delivery available through a single point of contact by 2005 was given in March 2002 in the new connections action plan. It has been decided to focus for 2005 on the on-line delivery of the services that will deliver the greatest impact and return on investment, reflecting the level of demand for a particular service and those which are pivotal in progressing the wider information society agenda. My Department is not a front-line provider of public services. Services to the public are provided by the wide range of agencies in the sector, such as the criminal justice agencies, the immigration and asylum agencies and the equality agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3948">The electronic delivery of services through a single point of contact is being progressed through the framework of the public service broker. The Reach agency, under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is charged with responsibility for its design and development. It is intended to launch the first stage of the public services broker at the end of this month. A public facing website, <i>www.reachservices.ie</i>, will be designed to act as a single point of access to a range of services offered by the public service. The website will initially provide access by means of links to forms or on-line services provided on other websites. It will provide access to information and application forms for up to 900 services when it is launched. Approximately 25 services, from the citizenship, asylum and courts areas of the justice and equality sector, are included in this initial selection of services. Additional services will be added over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3949">Reach is also working to provide essential on-line capabilities for the benefit of customers and public service providers. The capabilities will include an integration framework that will allow for the secure electronic transmission and exchange of service requests. An early version of the framework is in operation in the form of the inter-agency messaging system, which facilitates secure messaging between agencies such as the General Registrars Office, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Central Statistics Office. My Department and the agencies in the justice and equality sector are actively engaging with the inter-agency messaging system framework to facilitate exchange of business documents and data among the agencies in the sector and to achieve the behind the scenes integration that is necessary to deliver improved services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3950">The Reach agency is also developing facilities for registration and authentication of customer identity, address validation, the pre-population of forms with previously registered data and an e-payments facility. Another important facility is the capability for developing and hosting on-line interactive forms which will be offered to Departments and agencies that are developing on-line services for their customers. My Department is in continuing discussions with the Reach agency about the range of on-line services, combining a number of the new capabilities, which may be provided by the justice and equality sector in the next phases of <i>www.reachservices.ie</i>. Rather than re-inventing, my Department intends to use these capabilities where possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_3954">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative was to review all expenditure programmes over a three-year period. A review of the process by the Department of Finance and the expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-01 found that the target had been over-ambitious, however, and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2001 value for money study of the initiative, which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3955">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria. It was decided that the programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, or should involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. In May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics proposed for the first year of the next three-year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the topics proposed for 2003 and 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3956">In April 2003, the expenditure review central steering committee asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government's selection criteria and advised Departments and offices to select a small number of programmes and areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. Revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments and offices on foot of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3957">My Department has engaged fully in the expenditure review initiative to date. Two expenditure reviews have been completed recently, but have not yet been published. The first is a review of courthouse maintenance and building refurbishment in the Courts Service. The review is awaiting approval by the board of the Courts Service. When it has been approved by the board, it will be submitted to the Department of Finance's central steering committee on programme evaluation. The second review, which relates to the Prison Service's health care expenditure between 1997 and 2002, will be forwarded shortly to the central steering committee. Both reviews will be published on the Department's website following consideration by the central steering committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_3965">I propose to take Questions Nos. 517, 518 and 520 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3966">No person will become stateless as a result of the constitutional change approved by the people on 11 June. The approval of the people of the citizenship referendum and the consequent amendment of the Constitution do not change the statutory position regarding the right of a person born in Ireland to acquire Irish citizenship as set out at present in section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended in 2001. The Government signalled its legislative intentions with the publication of a document on 8 April last which included the draft text of a Bill to give effect to its policy on citizenship following acceptance of the referendum proposal. The preparation of a Bill on those lines is proceeding in my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. I have publicly indicated the Government's commitment to consulting the relevant parties in the North in advance of the publication of the Bill. I asked the Irish Human Rights Commission for its observations on the draft Bill. When it is published, I expect that the Bill will take appropriate account of the consultations and observations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3967">There is not and never has been a register of Irish-born citizens as such. There is no general requirement for a person born in Ireland who chooses to exercise the entitlement to Irish citizenship arising from that birth to do anything as a demonstration of that exercise. I do not propose to include provisions providing for such a register in the forthcoming Bill. The question of the procedure for issuing passports is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I do not expect the forthcoming Bill to include specific provisions relating to passport procedures. In the context of the Bill, however, it is intended, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the practicalities, that there will be no difference in the steps necessary for a person born in Ireland to establish entitlement to be an Irish citizen irrespective of the place of birth in Ireland. As there are no implications in the acceptance by the people of the referendum proposal for the Good Friday Agreement, I do not expect that the provisions of the implementing Bill will have any such implications.</p>

The couple withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of the Irish-born child. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which existed to allow persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003.

In accordance with the provisions of regulation 25 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989, I nominated Mr. Fergal Foley BL and Mr. Kevin Cross BL to a panel of persons from which the Garda Commissioner can appoint, as the need arises, a chairman of a Garda Síochána appeal board. The nominations, which came into effect from 1 June 2003, are not strictly speaking appointments to positions but nominations to a panel from which appointments might be made. The nominations were made to fill two positions on this panel left vacant following the appointment of Mr. Brian Curtin BL to the Circuit Court in November 2001 and the death of Mr. Michael Feehan SC in 2002.</p>

The applicant stated on his application form that his intention was to visit Ireland and documentation accompanying the application stated he had an appointment for a consultation at an Irish medical clinic. No supporting evidence of a medical condition was submitted with the application. It was noted that a previous visa application made by the applicant in November 2003 had also been refused by my Department. The current application was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In particular, it was considered that the applicant had not displayed sufficient evidence of his obligations to return home following his proposed visit. My Department does not have any record of having received an appeal in relation to this visa application. It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_4222">Wildlife legislation lays down a number of restrictions designed to protect bird life during the nesting season, to prevent forest fires and to protect vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction. Under section 40(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended by section 46 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, it is an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy any vegetation growing on land not then cultivated during the period from 1 March to 31 August.</p>

During this period it is not an offence, in the ordinary course of agriculture or forestry, to destroy vegetation growing in a hedge or ditch or to cut or grub isolated furze bushes or growths of fern, or to destroy any noxious weed to which the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 applies. Section 39 of the Wildlife Act 1976 lays down further particular restrictions and prohibitions on the burning of vegetation or the lighting of a fire nearwoods and other specified sites and specifies conditions to be met if it is proposed to burn vegetation.</p>

Candidates must hold a qualification in town planning recognised by the Local Appointments Commissioners and have a minimum of between three and seven years' satisfactory postgraduate experience of town planning, depending on the post involved. The assistant planner grade is open to newly graduated planners or individuals without a qualification in town planning recognised by the Local Appointments Commissioners, but who have a relevant qualification, such as in architecture, engineering, chartered surveying, environmental economics, geography, and who have at least two years' relevant experience. In general, candidates for all planner posts would be expected to possess a high standard of technical training and experience. In light of these requirements, it would not normally be necessary for qualifications to be indicated on reports or correspondence.</p>

The summary for policymakers is available at <i>http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/reports.htm</i>. The panel produced this report following a request from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to assess the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft engines.</p>
            <p eId="para_4229">The Irish scientific community contributes to the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Measurement of cloud cover and solar input are made at both Valentia and Mace Head, County Galway, for scientific and research purposes. The work by the panel informs the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. In this context, Ireland participates in the global United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto process within the EU in the light of the continuing need for further and sustained action across all policy areas to ensure that Kyoto targets are met and further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are made subsequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_4230">I am satisfied that EU and Government policy should continue to be developed in the context of the analysis and advice provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change. The special report on aviation and global atmosphere reinforces the necessity for further work to reduce scientific and other uncertainties, understand better the options for reducing emissions, better inform decision makers, and improve the understanding of the social and economic issues associated with the demand for air transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_4231">I understand that the high rate of transatlantic flights over Ireland is not of special significance in regard to climate change in Ireland, as the effects are primarily global rather than localised.</p>

            <p eId="para_4261">Measures to ensure moderation of rent levels in the private rented sector have been targeted at boosting supply of available accommodation. Successive years of record housing output, together with the re-introduction in 2002 of interest deductibility against tax on rental income generally, has resulted in increased supply of accommodation available for renting. This in turn has led to declining rents. The Central Statistics Office has recently released figures indicating that average rents have declined by almost 7.5% since March 2002. The March 2004 Gunne report found that average rents in Dublin have declined by as much as 18% overall since 2001 with about 6% of the decline occurring in the period March 2003 to March 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4262">The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003, currently before the Oireachtas, provides that rents are to be no greater than the market rate and that rent reviews are to take place no more frequently than once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation in the interim. The legislative reforms will also increase the attractiveness of the sector to investors and thereby further underpin the positive trends in supply and rents.</p>

The terms of the cover under the scheme was negotiated by a sub-committee of the County and City Managers' Association, the Housing Finance Agency and a representative of my Department. These terms are renegotiated periodically by the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_4267">The cost of the scheme is met by way of an additional charge, currently 0.598%, to the rate of interest charged on individual loans. One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers. Borrowers who have existing loans with local authorities have the option of redeeming these loans and refinancing in the private sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_4275">Excellent progress is being made nationally in the provision of wastewater treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the EU urban wastewater treatment directive. Since 2000, wastewater collection and treatment systems have been completed under my Department's water services investment programme in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway and in the major towns of Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford, Midleton, Westport and Courtown and Riverchapel.</p>
            <p eId="para_4276">The recently completed Ringsend wastewater treatment plant in Dublin deals with the wastewater treatment requirements of all of Dublin city and south Dublin county, significant areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, and parts of County Meath. It will produce the single biggest ever improvement in the quality of Irish coastal waters and will restore bathing water standards throughout Dublin Bay. Other major schemes under construction, or due to start this year, include those at Cork Lower Harbour, Dungarvan, Tramore, Waterford, Sligo and Bray/Shanganagh. Schemes for Bundoran, Letterkenny and New Ross are expected to commence in 2005, together with the Arklow main drainage scheme, subject to the outcome of legal proceedings relating to the location of the treatment plant in the latter case.</p>
            <p eId="para_4277">The urban wastewater treatment directive requires specific wastewater treatment and/or collection facilities to be in place by 31 December 2005 for discharges from a graduated range of agglomeration thresholds. The current water services investment programme, which covers the years 2004 to 2006, incorporates all the remaining wastewater schemes needed for full compliance with the directive. It also includes all the schemes required to give effect to the commitment in the agreed programme for Government for the provision of wastewater treatment for all agglomerations with populations of more than 1,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4278">At the beginning of the national development plan, compliance with the year 2005 requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive stood at 25%. This had risen to 84% by the end of 2003. Overall, I am satisfied with the rate of progress being achieved in the wastewater treatment area in response to our obligations under the directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_4288">The initial target of the expenditure review initiative was to review all expenditure programmes over a three year period. However, a review of the process by the Department of Finance and expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review themes was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study of the expenditure review initiative in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_4289">In June 2001 the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Department of Finance and individual Departments and offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria such as programmes selected for review should reflect Government priorities or strategic result areas, involve significant levels of expenditure, etc. Subsequently, in May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review themes proposed for the first year of the next three year planning horizon, 2002-04, and noted the themes proposed for 2003 and 2004. In April 2003, the expenditure review central steering committee asked Departments and offices to update their expenditure review plans, again in consultation with the Department of Finance. The committee emphasised the Government’s selection criteria and advised that Departments and offices should select a small number of programmes/areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. On foot of this process, revised expenditure review plans were drawn up by Departments and offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_4290">Overall, nine expenditure reviews of my Department's programmes have been completed to date. In addition, the major infrastructure programmes with which my Department is concerned have been evaluated as part of the mid-term review of different operational programmes under the current community support framework and national development plan. Taking account of this, I am satisfied that the substantive spending programmes which come within my Department's remit have been reviewed since the inception of the expenditure review initiative.</p>

This board will proactively pursue compliance. One way in which unregistered accommodation will come to the attention of the board will be if the tenants refer disputes pertaining to such tenancies to the board. Unlike tenants, landlords must be registered in order to avail of the board's dispute resolution service. A double fee will apply to late registrations and penalties for convictions for non-registration are being increased.</p>

            <p eId="para_4301">An implementation working group has been set up by Mayo County Council with representatives from my Department, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council. The group is chaired by the director of services for Mayo west region, Mayo County Council, and has met on two occasions, 22 April 2004 and 26 May 2004. This group is reviewing all aspects of protection and restoration works in Dooncarton which is scheduled to meet again at the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_4302">Mayo County Council has informed my Department that a full review of the current status of the hillside is being carried out, including an assessment of the protection works, ditches and berms which have already been reinstated or constructed by the county council and the Office of Public Works. Based on this review the detailed design of fencing will be carried out and the issue of further resources required, if any, will be addressed. Mayo County Council is holding regular liaison meetings with the Dooncarton landslide committee and there has being excellent co-operation on the ground between the local committee and staff of Mayo County Council and the Office of Public Works. Reinstatement and protection works are proceeding in consultation with the committee with expenditure of just over €1 million to date. Restoration work for the graveyard including replacement and refurbishment of headstones is also about to commence with funding provided by Mayo County Council and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4304">While it may be appropriate to commence some provisions of the Residential Tenancies Bill earlier than others for practical reasons, I intend that provisions of the Bill will be brought into force as soon as possible after enactment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4305">Landlords are, in the first instance, responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants. Anti-social behaviour will be grounds for termination of the tenancy by the landlord and serious anti-social behaviour will entitle the landlord to terminate the tenancy with only seven days' notice, regardless of the duration of the tenancy. The notice period will be 28 days in the case of less serious, but persistent, behaviour where the tenant has been advised of the breach of his or her tenancy obligations and failed to remedy the behaviour within the time specified by the landlord.</p>
            <p eId="para_4306">If the tenant fails to vacate the dwelling on foot of the ensuing notice of termination, the landlord may refer a dispute to the private residential tenancies board. The Bill also gives third parties who are affected by anti-social behaviour a right to take a case to the private residential tenancies board against a landlord who, having been advised of the problem, failed to enforce the tenancy obligations of the tenant for such behaviour. The board after hearing a dispute relating to anti-social behaviour will issue a determination order regarding the matter and, if its order is not complied with, it will, at the request of an affected party, apply to the Circuit Court for an enforcement order.</p>

            <p eId="para_4598">I propose to take Questions Nos. 580 and 581 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4599">Decisions on the disbursement of dormant accounts funds are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board has engaged Area Development Management Limited to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf which will involve the disbursement of up to €30 million from the fund to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons, those affected by economic and social disadvantage, those affected by educational disadvantage and persons with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4600">The board's disbursement plan, published in late 2003, provides that at least 40% of total annual funding will be allocated to the area of economic and social disadvantage and at least 25% to each of the other two categories. Over the first year, funding allocated for economic and social disadvantage will wholly be allocated to RAPID, CLÁR or drugs task force areas and in subsequent years, not less then 50% of this funding shall be allocated annually to such areas. In addition, the plan provides that at least half of the allocation for the purposes of educational disadvantage will go towards programmes or projects within RAPID and drugs task force areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4601">Under the current round of funding, therefore, projects which are not in RAPID, CLÁR or drugs task force areas can qualify for assistance in respect of projects targeting educational disadvantage and persons with a disability. An application from the group referred to by the Deputy has been received by Area Development Management Limited. All applications received will be evaluated by it against the criteria set out in the published guidelines and recommendations made to the dormant accounts board for decision. The group concerned will be advised of the outcome in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_4607">Application forms for all grant schemes administered by my Department are currently available on-line via my Departments website <i>www.pobail.ie.</i> The provision of better quality of service and greater access to the Department for the customer is one of the key tenets of my Department’s recently completed ICT strategy plan. The plans includes provision for on-line application facilities for Gaeltacht and community grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4608">The electronic delivery of services through a single point of contact is being progressed through the framework of the public services broker. The Reach agency is charged with responsibility for its design and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4609">I understand that it is intended to launch the first stage of the public services broker at the end of this month. This will be a public facing website, to be known as <i>reachservices.ie</i>, designed to act as a single point of access to a range of services offered by the Irish public service. Initially reachservices.ie will provide access through links to forms or other on-line services provided on other websites including application forms on my Department’s website.</p>
            <p eId="para_4610">Among the other facilities that Reach is developing is the capability for developing and hosting on-line interactive forms, which will be made available to Departments and agencies that are developing on-line services for their customers and I understand that this service will be available in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_4611">My Department is currently in the process of developing a comprehensive IT system for the administration of Gaeltacht grants, which will be completed by August this year. It is intended that when this system has bedded down within the Department, the extension of the system to include the provision of an on-line interactive service with Reach will be pursued.</p>

     <b>Mr. J. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
     if his Department has achieved the target, set out in the initiation of the expenditure review initiative in 1997, that all Government expenditure be subject to a formal review under that initiative every three years; and if not, the areas of expenditure in respect of which the three yearly review has not taken place.

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4614">I propose to take Questions Nos. 584 and 585 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4615">As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established 2002, bringing together a range of functions previously held by six different Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4616">While the initial target of the expenditure review initiative was to cover all expenditure programmes over a three year period, I understand that a review of the process by the Department of Finance/expenditure review central steering committee in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious. In June 2001 the Government decided that the Department of Finance and individual Departments/offices should compile and agree a work plan of review topics based on specific selection criteria (i.e. Government priorities, strategic result areas, significant levels of expenditure, etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_4617">In May 2002, the Government approved a schedule of expenditure review topics for the three-year planning horizon (2002-04). Subsequently, in April 2003 the expenditure review central steering committee asked Departments to update their expenditure review plans, in consultation with the Department of Finance, placing the emphasis on a small number of programmes/areas involving major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4618">My Department is progressing with the programme of reviews agreed with the expenditure review central steering committee. In line with the agreed programme, reviews of scéimanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht and the local drugs task forces are ongoing and scheduled for completion later this year. A further two reviews are envisaged for na hoileáin and ciste na Gaeilge in 2005 and my Department will continue to liaise with the expenditure review central steering committee in relation to the future development of the review programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4619">I also wish to advise the Deputy that a number of reviews of areas now under the remit of my Department were carried out under the aegis of the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. These were as follows: review of canal expenditure — completed in November 1998; review of deontais faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) 1929-1979 — completed in November 1998; and review of Údarás na Gaeltachta — completed in October 2000.</p>

     the position in regard to proposals, contained in the joint programme, for a subsidised cargo service to islands offshore; and the islands which will be so subsidised.

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4621">As the Deputy is aware, there is a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to identify proposals to provide a subsidised cargo service to islands in consultation with island communities and ferry operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_4622">At the moment, my Department subsidises the provision of cargo ferry services to the three Aran islands off the County Galway coast and to Cape Clear Island, County Cork. In addition, subsidies are also provided for roll on/roll off services capable of serving the cargo requirements of Arranmore Island, County Donegal, and Bere Island, County Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_4623">Last year, consultants were commissioned by my Department to carry out a review of subsidised transport services to a number of islands. The islands included were Tory, Inishturk, Clare Island, Inis Mór, Inis Meáin, Inis Oírr, Inishboffin and Cape Clear. This report, which was completed earlier this year and is available on my Department's website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>, contains a recommendation that, in the event that additional funding becomes available for the provision of ferry services to the islands, consideration should be given to providing a monthly freight service to the remainder of the islands which were the subject of the report. The consultants also estimated that the annual cost of such a service would be in the order of €250,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4624">The issue of extended freight services to the islands will be kept under constant review having regard to the funding available for the provision of transport services to the islands and the competing demands on that funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_4626">I wish to state at the outset that the question referred to by the Deputy was addressed to the Minister of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who replied to same on 30 March 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4627">Under the national development plan a seven-year programme has been put in place by my Department to develop strategic Gaeltacht piers in consultation with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resource and/or the relevant local authorities. My Department may make grants of up to 100% available under the programme, while the works in question are undertaken by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or by the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_4628">Helvick pier has been identified as a strategic Gaeltacht pier under this programme. However, it is estimated that the development of the pier would cost in excess of €4 million, which would be outside the scope and scale of development normally envisaged under the programme. My Department has, however, had discussions with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources regarding this project. Should that Department be in a position to allocate funding to this project in the future, my Department would be open to considering the question of co-funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_4790">In the case of local projects, funding is provided for food only and is based on a rate per meal per child.

The current rates of funding for the various meal types are as follows: breakfast €0.55, light meal €1.20, and dinner €1.70. These rates are reviewed each year. The review has regard to information supplied by project sponsors, who are required to submit financial accounts at the end of each school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4792">In 2003, €3.29 million was spent on the school meals programme. Some 382 schools with a total of over 50,650 pupils benefited from the urban scheme while 347 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which benefited some 26,000 children under local school meals projects.

            <p eId="para_4808">A person who becomes ill and requires a prolonged period of hospital treatment may qualify for disability benefit from my Department if they have paid sufficient PRSI contributions. Where a person has not worked or has insufficient PRSI contributions, they may qualify for the disability allowance, which is subject to a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_4809">In order to qualify for disability allowance a person must have a disability which substantially restricts their capacity to undertake work which would otherwise be suitable for a person of similar age, experience and qualifications. Under the current arrangements, neither disability benefit nor disability allowance is affected by the residential status of the recipient. Payment of both of these payments can therefore, be made where the applicant is in hospital for medical treatment or is in any other form of residential care, either on a short-term or long-term basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4810">The feasibility of introducing a payment to meet the additional costs arising from disability is currently being examined by a working group which has been established under the programme for prosperity and fairness.

            <p eId="para_4812">Child benefit delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family regardless of income levels or employment status. It supports all children but delivers proportionately more assistance to those on low incomes and with larger families. It does not distort parental choice in respect of labour force participation, and contributes towards alleviating child poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_4813">Child benefit is not intended primarily to meet child care costs. However, the very substantial increases in benefit in recent years can make a significant contribution to meeting those costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4814">Budget 2004 provided for a €6 per month increase, or 4.8%, in the rate of child benefit payable in respect of each of the first two children and €8 per month, or 5.1% increase in the rate payable in respect of the third and subsequent children.</p>
            <p eId="para_4815">Over the period since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by €93.51 at the lower rate and €115.78 at the higher rate, increases of 246% and 234% respectively, compared with inflation of 26.9%. This level of increase is unprecedented and delivers on the Government's objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to all parents.</p>

An example of this is the inter-agency messaging system, IAMS, between agencies such as the general registrar's office, GRO, my Department and the central statistic's office. One practical effect of this system is the automatic notification of an electronically-registered birth to my Department making it possible to change child benefit payments without the parents having to repeat basic information, or provide copies of a birth certificate. This has improved the delivery of child benefit to customers. Families in receipt of child benefit can now expect to receive notification of increased payment within days of electronic registration of the birth of a second or subsequent child, without any need to complete an application form.</p>
            <p eId="para_4835">The IAMS facility is being further developed to facilitate exchange of business documents and data among a wider range of Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4836">Other key projects include the recently completed redesign of my Department's website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i> and the development of proposals in relation to a framework for public service cards based on the personal public service number which would provide access for customers to a range of public services. The Department is working with REACH in developing facilities for registration and authentication of customer identity, address validation, improved on-line application forms and an e-payments facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_4837">I am arranging for more detailed information to be put together on the range of eGovernment activities being progressed and which my Department is involved with and this will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4840">I propose to take Questions Nos. 602 and 603 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4841">The objective of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, launched in 1997, is to provide a systematic analysis of what is being achieved by expenditure in each programme, a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes and a systematic and evidence based approach to policy making.</p>
            <p eId="para_4842">My Department has undertaken a range of expenditure reviews under the initiative. These reviews have been carried out by working groups involving staff from the relevant scheme areas, with representation from the Department of Finance and other Departments and agencies, as appropriate. A steering committee is in place in the Department to provide support and direction to the process, while the process overall is overseen by a central steering committee, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4843">Since the launch of the initiative in 1997, there have been two phases. At the end of the current phase my Department will have completed 22 expenditure reviews, reflecting engagement at some level with approximately 70% of our programme expenditure. The principal programme areas which have not yet been specifically examined under the ERI process are child benefit and payments to widows and widowers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4844">The aim at the outset of the process was to review all expenditure programmes every three years. However, a review of the process by the central steering committee in 2000-01 found that this target had been over-ambitious and that a more focused approach to the selection of review topics was required. This view was supported by a Comptroller and Auditor General value for money study in 2001 which proposed that a more realistic target should be set that took into account the level of evaluative capacity in Departments generally. In that context my Department has operated on the basis of agreeing schedules of reviews with the Department of Finance and presenting these to the central steering committee. The Department has delivered on reviews, with those specified either completed or commenced and currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4845">The following are the reviews which have been completed in the Department to date and those which are currently under way: In Phase 1 (1997-2001), a total of 13 reviews were completed:</p>

     the PRSI class paid by taxi drivers; the reason benefits are restricted for such self-employed persons; if she will increase the range of benefits which can be claimed under this category; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4889">Workers are generally insured under the Social Welfare Acts either as employed or self-employed contributors. The nature of an employment contract, that is, whether as an employee under a contract of service or a self-employed person on a contract for services, determines the class of PRSI contribution due, which in turn determines the range of benefits and pensions to which contributors can build up an entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4890">Most workers are insured as employees, paying PRSI contributions at Class A which gives them entitlement to a broad range of benefits. While there is no reason why a taxi driver could not be an employee, most taxi drivers are self-employed and pay PRSI contributions at Class S, giving entitlement to a narrower range of benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_4891">Class S PRSI was introduced for the self-employed in 1988 and they have been compulsorily insured since. They are eligible for the following benefits and pensions: widow/ers contributory pension; orphans contributory pension; old age contributory pension; maternity benefit; adoptive benefit; and bereavement grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4892">When compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced, coverage for insurance-based short-term benefits, such as disability and unemployment, was excluded given the difficulties of applying these to self-employed workers. This represents the position in many EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4893">There are no plans at present to extend any of the short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measures would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the wider budgetary context. To extend the range of benefits for self-employed contributors would necessitate an appropriate increase in the rate of PRSI Class S contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_4894">My Department is examining the issues arising from the extension of other long-term benefits to self-employed persons, such as invalidity pensions. However I am not in a position to bring forward specific proposals at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4895">I would point out however that a taxi driver or any other self-employed person may claim an assistance based payment such as unemployment assistance, or disability allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4896">Entitlement to these payments is contingent on satisfying the appropriate conditions, including a means test under which the annual income from self-employment is assessed.</p>

     <b>Mr. Haughey</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     if she will review the position whereby a person who is in receipt of a disability allowance loses this benefit if they decide to take a spouse or partner who is on a good income; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this does not apply to a person who is in receipt of an invalidity pension; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4898">The social welfare code provides for a range of social insurance benefits which are financed through PRSI contributions, and a range of social assistance payments, which are payable subject to a means test and financed by the Exchequer through general tax revenue. The purpose of the means test is to ensure that, for people who do not have social insurance cover or who have insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for benefit, resources are targeted at those most in need. Thus social protection of the population in general is provided through a combination of insurance-based and payments targeted at need.</p>
            <p eId="para_4899">A person with a disability or long-term illness might qualify for an insurance based payment if they have sufficient PRSI contributions either disability benefit or invalidity pension. Entitlement to social insurance benefits is not affected by the claimant's income or, if one of a couple, by their spouse-partner's income although there may be an impact on the level of payments as spousal means are taken into account in the calculation of qualified adult additions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4900">Where a person with a disability or long-term illness does not qualify for an insurance based payment because of insufficient PRSI contributions, he or she may qualify for a means-tested disability allowance. In assessing means, account is taken of the claimant's own means and, in the case of a couple, the joint means of the couple are assessed. In addition, the value of any capital is also assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4901">While these arrangements might serve to explain the particular circumstances outlined in the Deputy's question, it might be noted that applicants for disability allowance are treated in the similar manner to applicants for other social assistance payments, for example, unemployment assistance, old age pension. A departure from these arrangements would represent a fundamental change in the social welfare system with major implications both in terms of the cost and financing of the system. The policy of successive Governments has been to improve the level of social protection provided through the social insurance system, by extending access to coverage and the range of benefits which are covered by the system.</p>

     <b>Mr. Ring</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
     her views on whether it is fair that when supplementary welfare assistance is awarded to a person in the Western Health Board in the County Mayo region for domestic appliances and furniture, these items are delivered to them from a firm in County Galway, that no local businesses can provide the goods, that it can be over 100 miles from these firms to their homes giving them no immediate back-up when the goods are faulty and that it is unfair on small, local businesses being squeezed out of the business; and if he will consider leaving the suppliers to be nominated by each local community welfare officer, as it always was.

            <p eId="para_5031">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme provides for a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. The scheme also provides that boards may grant assistance with exceptional needs in kind as well as in cash. The grant of assistance in exceptional cases is at the discretion of the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_5032">The Western Health Board was contacted and has advised that for the past six years it has operated a policy of using a central source to supply certain types of goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_5033">In the opinion of the board the policy it operates is the most effective and efficient way to deal with the type of assistance in question and also provides good value for money. The board is satisfied that the service arrangements in operation are satisfactory.</p>
            <p eId="para_5034">The board has further advised that the contract in place complies with EU law. In this regard tenders for the contract to supply the goods were advertised in local and national newspapers as well as the official EU journal.</p>

            <p eId="para_5036">Consultation with stakeholders is a key element of the policy making process within my Department in order to respond effectively to the needs of customers in the context of a changing economic and social environment. Such consultation and the development of participative structures where customers, representative organisations and stakeholders generally can express views, provide feedback on services delivered and input into policy making is necessary to ensure that income support programmes and associated supports continue to be relevant and effective. This is recognised in the Department's statement of strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5037">In the last week a major public consultative process was commenced by the Department relating to the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, on which I launched a major report last year. In order to progress policy consideration and development in this area, the Department circulated a consultation document which aims to focus interested parties on the specific complex issues which need to addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5038">These issues, which are discussed at length in the report, include benefit design, delivery, cost and financing of long-term care in the future. The document has been circulated to over 70 interested parties including Government departments, health boards, interest groups and the social partners. These organisations and groups have been asked to consider a number of issues and to reply to the Department by 16 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_5039">Last year I undertook a major nationwide consultation process with families, organisations who work with families and public representatives to hear, first hand, their views on developments to date and what they see as the priorities for strengthening family well-being. It is my priority to ensure that family in Ireland is fully taken into account in further developing policies and programmes to afford the widest possible protection and assistance to families and family life. My aim is to bring forward a strategy to achieve this objective before the end of this year. In doing so I will also take full account of the issues raised at the fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_5040">During the first half of 2003, my Department, in co-operation with the Combat Poverty Agency, undertook an extensive public consultation process to inform the development of our National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005, NAPs/incl., which was submitted to the European Commission in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_5041">This consultation process built on feedback obtained from the social partners and the community and voluntary sector during a previous round of consultation relating to the revision of the national anti-poverty strategy in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_5042">The NAPs/incl. consultation process commenced with a social inclusion forum convened by the National Economic and Social Forum in January 2003 which was attended by individual members and representatives of the community and voluntary sectors. A wider consultation then followed in April and May. This involved a series of national and regional seminars and an invitation in the national newspapers for submissions. There was a wide-ranging response across the board, and some 65 written submissions were received.</p>

            <p eId="para_5118">Budget 2004 provided for increases in the weekly personal rates of social welfare payments, which were well ahead of inflation, as follows: a €11.50 increase in the maximum personal rate of widow/er's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for those aged 66 years and over, this represents an increase of 7.4% and a real increase, which is well ahead of inflation; and a €10 increase in the maximum personal rate of all other weekly payments, including all other widow/er's pensions and all old age pensions. These changes represent increases ranging from 6.4% to 10.3% and real increases which are well ahead of inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5119">Budget 2004 also provided for: increases in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances ranging from 6.3% to 11.4%, again representing substantial real increases; child benefit increases of €6 per month for the first two children and €8 for the third and subsequent child; an increase of €200, from €2,500 to €2,700, in the widowed parent grant; a €100 increase in the respite care grant, and a significant increase in the weekly income disregard for carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5120">Over the period 1997 to 2004 social welfare spending has nearly doubled, from €5.7 billion to a projected €11.3 billion in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_5121">In this period, rates were increased far in excess of the cost of living. For example, the rate of old age pension has increased by 80%, representing a real increase of over 40%; the old age contributory pension has increased by 69%, representing a real increase of 32%; the widow/er's contributory pension aged 66 years and over has increased by 85.3%, representing a real increase of 45%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5122">The levels of increases provided in budget 2004, in conjunction with the levels of increases provided over the period from 1998, demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to safeguard and enhance the living standards of the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

     if she will provide the most immediate statistics available on the number of citizens who have made use of the information giving services of Comhairle

            <p eId="para_5124">The national information agency, Comhairle, is charged with the task of supporting the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services so as to ensure that citizens have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information relating to social services. One of the principal ways in which it carries out that task is through the support it provides to the national network of citizen's information centres and the citizen's information phone service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5125">During 2003, the last year for which statistics are available, citizen's information centres received almost 560,000 queries from citizens which represents an increase of 23% on the previous year. Personal callers comprised just over half of those queries with telephone, letter, e-mail and outreach services making up the balance. The citizen's information phone service which was launched as a nationwide service in May 2003 received more than 41,000 calls in 2003, an increase of 112% over the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5126">Comhairle also makes information available to citizens through the OASIS on-line access to services, information and support, website which provides user-friendly information on the full range of public services. In 2003, there were almost one million hits on this website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5127">A total of 359,500 copies of Comhairle information publications were produced and distributed to members of the public in 2003.</p>
