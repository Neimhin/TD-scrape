          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, that despite the Irish Cancer Society and the local cancer steering committee jointly funding in 2004 a full-time oncology liaison nurse post for Cavan General Hospital, the HSE Dublin North East has failed since 2004 to provide a position number for the advertising and filling of the post, thereby denying this vital resource to cancer sufferers in Cavan and Monaghan; and call on the HSE to approve the advertising and filling of this critically needed post forthwith.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the two large seizures of cocaine in Kildare within the past week, one in Rathangan with a street value of €50,000 and the second in Celbridge with a street value of €2 million.  While these seizures are welcome they are the tip of the iceberg in terms of cocaine availability.  The Minister of State with responsibility for community affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, outlined the need for a different approach to cocaine treatment within the past week.  Curbing supply must be part of the response.  Kildare has the lowest ratio of gardaí to population nationally and this must be rectified immediately.  The noticeable lack of a Garda presence is making Kildare a soft target.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">The Deputy will appreciate that the commitment in the programme for Government was the subject of a review in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Department asked the Law Reform Commission to examine whether such a measure would improve the system.  The Law Reform Commission has recently opined that in its view it would be a mistake to proceed with such a power as it would be counter-productive in terms of the administration of justice.  In such circumstances, we will have to examine the Law Reform Commission's arguments before deciding whether to abide by its wise counsel in this matter or to proceed with the commitment that was made some years ago.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_105">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_106">That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of an agreement between Ireland and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on participation in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 27 November 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">We all recognise that climate change is one of the major global environmental issues of the day.  This problem, which affects the entire planet, cannot be solved by any single nation, and certainly not by a nation of just 4 million people.  When the Stern report was published recently, it was pointed out that if the UK economy were to close down and to cease all emissions, it would be the equivalent of saving 2% of global emissions.  It was argued that rapidly developing economies, such as China, would wipe out the benefit of that saving within months.  If all Irish emissions were to stop overnight, the impact of that saving would be lost in a matter of hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires a unique level of international co-operation.  Changes are needed in virtually every economic sector.  The European Union has taken a lead role in applying the targets agreed at Kyoto for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland is fully committed to the Union's policies in this area.  Ireland, as a modern developed nation, a member state of the EU and a responsible member of the wider international community, is playing its part in the co-ordinated global response to climate change.  Specifically, Ireland has ratified the Kyoto Protocol and is committed to meeting its Kyoto target of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above the 1990 levels.  In that context, Ireland will reduce its projected greenhouse gas emissions from 78.2 million tonnes to 63 million tonnes between 2008 and 2012, which is the indicative period established in the protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Ireland has already put in place measures to reduce its annual emissions by 11 million tonnes, 3 million of which will arise from the participation of power plants and large industry in the EU emissions trading scheme.  I have detailed such measures in the House on previous occasions.  They are outlined in Ireland's Pathway to Kyoto Compliance, which I published in July and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Ireland is fully committed to and supportive of the EU emissions trading scheme.  The Government agrees with the Stern report that the scheme has the potential to become a global carbon trading system.  Ireland is committed to purchasing a further 3.6 million tonnes in credits under the Kyoto Protocol, if necessary.  A range of other commitments will further reduce Ireland's emissions between now and 2012.  The commitments in question have been announced in the Green Paper on Energy, in Transport 21 and in budget 2006.  We can anticipate that some further changes will be made in this area in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">It is worth recalling that between 1990 and 2004, Ireland successfully decoupled its economic growth from its growth in emissions.  Commentators often overlook the reality that Ireland's emissions grew by 23% in that period, whereas its economy grew by almost 150%.  Ireland is an exemplar of the point made in the Stern report that economic growth does not need to be retarded by a commitment to Kyoto.  A country and an economy can grow while remaining committed to Kyoto.  I suggest that the economies which will develop most in the next few years will be those which are committed to Kyoto.  Ireland was one of the first EU member states to submit its 2008-12 national allocation plan.  Ireland's proposals in that regard are known as its NAP II proposals.  As Deputies are aware, the European Commission yesterday accepted Ireland's NAP II proposals, subject to any amendment notified to the Commission before 31 December next.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">I am seeking the approval of the Dáil for the terms of a contribution agreement between Ireland and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in respect of Ireland's participation in the multilateral carbon credit fund.  We had a good discussion on the proposal at the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government.  There are two separate tranches to Ireland's participation agreement in this fund, the first which relates to a contribution of €5 million to the project-based element of the fund and the second of which relates to a contribution of €15 million for the fund's green investment scheme element.  I will explain both of the tranches in more detail after I have outlined the background to the proposal before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">As I have said, Ireland has been able to stabilise and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2001, Ireland's emissions were 27% above their 1990 levels, but by 2004 they had been reduced to 23% above their 1990 levels.  We have some more work to do before we can reach the target of 13%, which we intend to do between 2008 and 2012.  Ireland's compliance with its Kyoto commitments will be assessed during that key period.  Ireland will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 14.6 million tonnes in each year during that period, by means of a combination of measures which have been implemented; participation in the EU emissions trading scheme; and the use of the flexible mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol to purchase allowances.  The Government has capped the purchasing requirement at 3.6 million allowances per annum, or 18 million allowances in total over the entire period between 2008 and 2012.  The total reduction that is necessary for Ireland is 15.2 million tonnes.  As Ireland has accounted for 14.6 million, the remaining gap is just 600,000 tonnes.  Further measures are being put in place, particularly on foot of initiatives outlined in the Green Paper on Energy.  I do not want there to be the slightest doubt that we will bridge the remaining gap and meet our Kyoto commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The projections on which these figures are based were published in March 2006 and they underpinned separate Government decisions about the size of the burden to be taken on by firms in the emissions trading scheme.  The Government has decided that the emissions trading sector will reduce emissions by 3 million tonnes per annum between 2008 and 2012.  These decisions underpinned the preparation of Ireland's national allocation plan for 2008-12.  The Commission yesterday published its assessment of the first ten plans submitted to it by member states, including Ireland's plan.  The Commission accepted Ireland's NAP II programme.  Not all member states are in our happy position.  The Commission has started infringement procedures against Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy and Spain for not submitting their NAPs on time.  However, the Commission is seeking adjustments, as it has with all other NAP II submissions.  The Commission has proposed an average reduction of 7% across all member states.  In Ireland's case, the reduction demanded is lower, at 6.4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The end game has still to be played on this.  The Commission's decision should therefore be seen as a stage in the process.  The decision allows us the opportunity to resubmit our national allocation plan for further consideration by 31 December.  The Commission believes we have not yet made sufficient progress in our arrangements for Government purchases of allowances under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.  This is what we are addressing today.  This motion is to allow the first purchases to be made.  I have already indicated my intention to publish the carbon fund Bill shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The Commission had much more fundamental concerns with other member states' plans.  It was clear many of them over-allocated to their industries in the first phase of emissions trading, and the 2005 data for actual emissions proved this.  In Ireland's case, however, the 2005 data proved that we had allocated correctly, and the Commission has acknowledged this.  The basic principles of our plan are recognised by the Commission as being sound.  There will be extensive dialogue with the Commission in the coming weeks before we finalise the plan.  The outstanding issues can be met with relative ease.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The purchase of carbon credits is a legitimate, practical and logical option under the Kyoto Protocol.  The purchase of carbon credits is a key part of the Kyoto arrangements.  A country or a company producing over its target of carbon emissions can either reduce its emissions or buy them from another state or company that has spare credits.  This provides the motivation to save credits, as they have a value and can be transferred.  The Stern report discusses the urgency to go global with this mechanism.  Much of the analysis of the Stern report is specifically about the economic value of saving carbon.  The flexible mechanisms are not only important to Kyoto parties.  They are also very important to developing countries as they attract investment in modern clean technology.  This was very evident at the recent meeting of the parties to the protocol in Nairobi.  Measures to promote investment through the clean development mechanism in the least developed countries represented major progress at the conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The "Nairobi Framework", announced by the UN Secretary General, aims to use the expertise of the main UN development agencies to leverage greater funding for African countries, ensuring the benefits of trading in carbon is shared with the world's poorest nations.  In Nairobi, Sir Nicholas Stern repeated the key messages of his recent and much-acclaimed report.  He stated that each country should find the best mix of measures to meets its Kyoto responsibilities, including buying credits.  He also repeated the point that using carbon finance to accelerate action in developing countries is an urgent priority for international co-operation on climate change.  It is also a part of the moral responsibility of the developed world to assist, especially those countries which are energy deficient.  Such investment not only helps to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, but also contributes to sustainable development priorities of project host countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">If purchasing a carbon credit is the most efficient option, it is odd that some who say they endorse the Kyoto Protocol contest the validity of using this mechanism to assist in meeting Ireland's Kyoto targets.  Purchasing carbon credits is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol.  It has been specifically identified as a key mechanism by Sir Nicholas Stern, Tony Blair, the EU Commission, Al Gore and Kofi Annan.  It was singled out and praised by the president of the Nairobi conference.  Ireland will purchase a maximum of 18 million allowances or 3.6 million allowances for each year of the commitment period.  Ireland will certainly not be the only EU member state to do so.  In fact, we will be one of the very small players in the market.  National allocation plans that have been submitted to date show that EU member states alone are likely to purchase up to 500 million allowances to meet their commitments.  In Nairobi, it was suggested the figure might even be higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">While some have fumed at the idea of buying credits, they have been less than forthcoming in exploring the full economic and social consequences of not doing so.  If industry was forced to carry the full burden, the consequences could be very severe. Existing Irish industries would have to carry a huge economic burden.  Ireland would become an even more costly place to locate business and jobs.  Heavy energy users would face particular difficulties and Deputy O'Dowd mentioned two examples in his constituency.  The cost base of all industries would rise, electricity prices would be further inflated and domestic producers would face undercutting from imports.  Who would benefit from that?  Yet that is the precise consequence of the rigid approach being advocated by some people.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The agreement that I propose to sign with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, subject to the approval of the Dáil, is to invest €20 million in the new multilateral carbon credit fund offered by that bank in conjunction with the European Investment Bank.  As Deputy Cuffe pointed out, this fund is particularly virtuous as it is ring-fenced.  Ireland will invest €20 million with the bank.  The bank will use its expertise in project investment in eastern Europe, and its prior experience with carbon fund management, to secure contracts for projects to reduce emissions in return for emission reduction credits.  These projects will be fully validated and accredited by the UN supervisory bodies, and the credits will only be issued for verified emissions reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">There are two distinct elements to the fund.  The first is the project-based element.  I propose to invest €5 million in this element for projects eligible under either the Kyoto Protocol joint implementation mechanism, or the clean development mechanism.  The green carbon fund element will allow countries to sell spare Kyoto allowances to other countries in return for investment from the fund.  This is a government to government transfer.  Ireland will invest €15 million in this part of the fund.  Allowances can only be exchanged for verified emissions reductions.  This was a concern that came up repeatedly at yesterday's committee, so I will emphasise it again.  All of our investment in these funds will be directed towards good, environmentally-sound projects that will deliver verified emission reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The price of credits was also mentioned yesterday.  The bank envisages a price range of between €5 and €10 for projects in the fund.  This is an exceptional price and that is why it is important to secure early investment in the fund.  If we get agreement today, I can do so tomorrow.  We heard some speculation at the committee that carbon prices may rise to very high levels.  If one believes that the price of carbon is going to rise threefold or more from its present level, surely prudence and common sense dictate we move now to take advantage of the low-cost opportunities presented by this investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">I thank the members of the joint committee for the consideration they gave the motion yesterday.  I commend the motion to the House as an important contribution to Ireland's commitment to address global climate change and our responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_100">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_124">I take the opportunity of speaking on the motion before the House.  This proposal was laid before the Dáil on 27 November, allowing only three days for discussion or research on the matter.  Most Deputies are so busy they do not read everything that is laid before the Dáil, but this came to my attention yesterday at the Committee on the Environment and Local Government.  At that meeting the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Gilmore, the Green Party spokesman, Deputy Cuffe, and I asked that this motion should not be rushed or adopted before we had an opportunity to debate it in the Dáil.  I thank the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Roche, for conceding to have this debate in the Dáil, which I believe is important.  It is significant that at least we are having a debate even though we may be merely going through the motions in that the gun is already to the Minister's head in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">It is extraordinary that we find ourselves in this situation.  Just three days after the proposal was laid before the Dáil we are debating it, and it must go one way or the other.  From what the Minister said, he will sign this proposal this evening because I presume a majority of Members will endorse it.  That is democracy, in one sense, but it is not the way to handle a motion as important as this.  In my 17 years in the House I have always noted that legislation or other matter that is rushed through the Dáil at the last minute never turns out to be satisfactory.  The House is littered with examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">I recall my first year in the Dáil when the famous rod licence Bill was rushed through on 18 December and signed into law.  Then we had two years of a rod licence row in several constituencies, including mine, until the Government eventually had to back down.  I know the present Minister was not responsible for that, but that is what happened because the legislation was rushed through the Dáil.  Embarrassingly, two years later after everybody had seen the effects of the legislation, the Government backed down and abolished it.  The damage done by that event has not yet been rectified in communities in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">We have had more recent examples of rushed legislation such as the refund of the nursing home charges Bill, rushed through the Dáil before Christmas and then repented over at leisure.  It is a pity this motion is being dealt with in like manner.  Nonetheless, I am glad we are having a debate.  I blame the Government, first, for the delay.  However, the Minister must have taken his eye off the ball at some stage or perhaps he was not at the match at all because this should not be happening in the manner that it is.  After all, the Kyoto Protocol has existed for more than ten years.  What has the Government been doing about reducing emissions over that time?  Again, I am not blaming the current Minister, but this Government was in power all that time.  What concrete steps were taken to ensure we would not be in the position we find ourselves?</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I have glanced through the Minister's speech, much of which is very technical, and quite frankly some of it is above my head.  That would not be so if I had the opportunity to research this matter properly.  Figures are quoted to show what we should or might have been doing and what we did not do.  The bottom line is that the Government is obviously going to buy its way out of its obligations instead of taking the action necessary to reduce emissions and meet the standards required as members of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I recognise the Minister has a serious problem on his hands and that he has to sign on the dotted line some time today.  Perhaps we sympathise with him to a certain extent, but it is the role of Opposition to point out that we should never have been put in that position.  We should not be in that position today and neither should we have been yesterday at the Committee on Environment and Local Government.  The problem still has to be resolved.  We must reduce our emissions in Ireland if we are to meet the Kyoto requirements, rather than just buying our way out.  This seems to me, as a lay person, to be the lazy man's way of doing the job.  First, it will cost €5 million, then we will invest €15 million and then we will give €20 million to the banks.  If Ireland gives €20 million in taxpayers' money to the banks I do not know how we can be sure it will go towards solving the problem in any way.  It may take egg off the face of the Government, but it will certainly go no way towards solving the problem.  Not everybody has confidence in the banks being able to solve the problem for Ireland, and again that is a short-term solution to the dilemma in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">On the subject of EU legislation, serious conflicts can arise in the context of directives.  There are EU directives affecting farming, for example, whereby REP schemes etc. stipulate that cattle should be taken off the land and put in sheds between September and March.  We cannot damage the grass but nonetheless we put the cattle into slotted sheds with slurry pits that further add to our emissions problem.  This is in conflict with the directive which stipulates that emissions must be reduced.  That is just one example.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">There are many others in EU directives, whereby the emissions problem is added to and then Government is required to take steps to reduce it.  What has the Government done, for example, to ensure that all new houses have the necessary safeguards to reduce emissions?  What is its policy on wind energy?  Nobody is clear on that.  What is the Government doing to resolve this problem instead of just taking the option now at the last minute, with a gun to its head, to buy its way out of trouble?</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Perhaps in the short term people will be delighted that certain regulations were not brought in to reduce emissions, but in the long run it is the taxpayer and Ireland's position in the European Union that will suffer as a result of the Government having done nothing whatsoever to reduce emissions in its ten years in office.  In the period from 2008 to 2012, Ireland has agreed to limit annual greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above the 1990 levels.  While emissions in 2004 had been reduced to 23% over 1990 levels, achieving the protocol target without compromising economic and social development is extremely challenging.  The Government did not take up this challenge, rather it ran away from it.  We are now so far behind in our attempts that this emergency has arisen in the 11th hour and has put us in a position in which we should never have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The Minister has stated this is a problem for the entire planet.  While this may be the case, today it is also a problem for the Minister of his own making, because he did not adequately foresee it.  Why was this matter not discussed in the House on a day when it was adjourned because of a lack of business before it?  I do not understand why this issue was left until the last minute before anything was done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">In 2003, the price of a barrel of oil stood at $35.  This year, it is set to reach $70 again and we have been warned that the days of oil prices of $100 per barrel may not be too distant.  What actions has the Government taken to ensure that our oil dependency would not continue to increase at its present rate?  In his reply to this debate, the Minister should spell out the Government's policy on alternatives to oil.  For example, what is the policy on electricity generation from wind energy?</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Moreover, it is obvious that our European partners already have a serious headstart on Ireland in respect of emissions reduction.  In 2001, Austria sourced 22% of its energy consumption from renewable sources.  How does Ireland measure up?  Ireland must consider what the rest of Europe is doing to address the energy crisis it now faces.  Ireland must also ascertain how to develop an energy regime that is sustainable, renewable, clean and in accordance with the best health and safety practices, given that unlike many other EU countries, it does not rely on nuclear power and is unlikely to so do in the near future.  Ireland must also guarantee security of supply.  What is being done in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The EU has produced a Green Paper on energy that focuses on alternative and renewable energy.  However, it also incorporates an ongoing reliance on nuclear energy.  While Ireland must model its energy policy on that of the European Union, it must do so without the nuclear option.  Consequently, development of an energy policy for Ireland is more complex, due to its obligation to ensure security of supply in an expanding economy while at the same time complying with the Kyoto principles.  The Government has not taken up this challenge and must now take it up at the 11th hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Even if Ireland buys itself out of this challenge today, I fear the Government will become complacent again.  When the real crunch comes at the end of the four year period, the Government might recall that it was able to buy itself out in November 2006.  Although I do not know how many hundreds of millions of euro this will have cost the State, we may be obliged to buy ourselves out of it again, at a cost of billions instead of millions.  This appears to be the road down which the Government is going.  Therefore, we need an energy policy with short, medium and long-term targets, to be reviewed, tested and updated annually.  We cannot postpone immediate action and we must test the effect of such action on a regular basis.  The Minister and Government have failed to take up this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Fine Gael believes it is eminently possible to shift our dependence from imported non-renewable energy to indigenous renewable energy in respect of electricity generation.  When Fine Gael enters Government — as it hopes to do — it will move towards generating at least 33% of Ireland's electricity needs from renewable sources by 2025.  The party's policy document states it will try to achieve this target through State investment and a regulatory regime that will give access to the national grid to renewable sources above all others.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">While I will not enter into the Bellanaboy debate, why did Ireland sign off to Shell the rights to the vast potential of its energy fields and offshore waters without any benefit to the State?  This is a serious question for the Government as the decision has cost the State billions.  This took place during the tenure of a Minister from my constituency, rather than that of the present Minister.  He signed off the rights without any reward to the State, which was a desperate mistake and error.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">As for electricity generation, wind energy has been described as an oil well in the sky.  Although wind is an abundant resource in Ireland, it has one of the lowest levels of wind power generation in Europe.  Wind energy will be vital if we are to meet the Kyoto targets.  Fine Gael will prioritise the creation of a network of wind turbines to harness the potential of wind energy in Ireland, which is estimated to be the best in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Closer to home, Fine Gael welcomes recent Government steps to provide grants to householders to assist them to move to renewable energy.  However, the grant is in no way sufficient and came far too late.  When in office, Fine Gael proposes a new deal for householders under which it will expand grant aid to those householders who wish to convert existing home heat technology to renewable energy technology.  The grants will be increased from €500 to €3,500.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">The Labour Party opposes the motion.  It does not do so because of its intrinsic merits, which the party might support in a different context.  If there was general compliance with Ireland's Kyoto commitments, some of the benign purposes for which this motion is intended might recommend themselves to the party.  However, Labour Members oppose it because they wish to flag what is happening in this regard to the people.  This is the start of a process.  As the Minister noted, "this motion is to allow the first actual purchases to be made".  This constitutes the start of an obligation on the people and taxpayers to pay for carbon and to pay for the failures of the Government in this sphere during the past ten years.  The amount being sought for approval from the Dáil today may be relatively small in the context of what Ireland will be eventually obliged to pay.  However, this constitutes the start of a bill for the taxpayer that may be as high as €500 million by 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">While the Minister and the Government will always recoil from the concept of carbon taxation, there should be no mistake about what is being done in the House today. This is a motion which taxes the Irish people for carbon and which is the start of a payment process which will cost the Irish people hundreds of millions of euro in the years ahead.  That payment and that burden on the taxpayer must be met because the Government has failed over the past ten years to align our carbon emissions with what was required by the Kyoto Agreement.  It is a failure which will cost the taxpayer a great deal of money and which will cost the environment and future generations.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">——and returns enthusiastically converted to the need to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Let us tell the Minister the history of this.  The Kyoto Agreement was reached in 1997, the year Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats returned to Government.  The Minister has had the entire life of the Kyoto Agreement — almost ten years — to get it right and he has not.  He now faces a situation where, in November 2006, he tells us we must reduce our carbon emissions by over 15 million tonnes a year between now and 2012.  He tells us a fairy tale that of the reduction 8 million tonnes a year will be met through fine plans of the Government for public transport, alternative energies and reducing the cattle herd, 3 million tonnes a year will be met from industry through emissions trading and 3.6 million tonnes a year must be bought by us.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">First, 3.6 million tonnes a year between now and 2012 will cost €180 million at today's prices, but yesterday the European Commission made a number of decisions on the emissions trading scheme the purpose of which is to drive up the price of carbon.  The European Commission has concluded the emissions trading scheme operating in Europe is not achieving its objective, that the price of carbon is so low that it is not providing sufficient incentive and motivation for polluting industries to reduce carbon emissions and to switch to clean technologies, and that the price must be increased.  The European Commission's ambition is to raise the price to the region of €30 per tonne.  If it reaches €30 per tonne, the 3.6 million tonnes a year the Minister is already committed to buying will cost the taxpayer in the region of €500 million between now and 2012, and of course there will be a continuing cost thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">That figure, of course, is dependent on us getting away with purchasing 3.6 million tonnes a year by way of allowances.  It seems the target of 3 million tonnes a year, which the Minister expects to be achieved through the emissions trading system, must be reduced because of yesterday's decision.  The European Commission has put a new cap on the amount which we can achieve through the emissions trading scheme, which reduces it by about 1.5 million tonnes.  The Minister told us in select committee yesterday that he will try to negotiate his way out of that and persuade the Commission to bring the cap back up.  I wish him luck.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_153">The Minister is a persuasive man.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_154">If he does not succeed, it must be found somewhere or it must be paid for.  Of course, the 3.6 million tonnes a year in allowances which the Minister is already committing to buy will also need to be increased if he does not achieve the reductions of 8 million tonnes a year which he hopes to achieve through all of the various worthy measures he outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">My difficulty with him not achieving that 8 million tonnes a year reduction is his Government's record.  It is quite horrific to look back at the litany of missed opportunities over the past ten years where this country could have achieved real and enduring reductions in carbon emissions and the extent to which we are contributing to the global warming problem.  We are repeatedly told this country has built 500,000 new dwellings in the past ten years.  That is great and I am certainly happy with that, but over that period there has also been a European directive aimed at energy conservation in building which requires the energy labelling of buildings.  That energy labelling directive should have been in force from 1 January 2005.  The Minister did not implement it.  He has actually looked for a derogation until 2009 in implementing the labelling of buildings.  In the period of this rapid growth in construction there was an ideal opportunity to put in place the energy conservation measures which were coming down the track at us anyway and which would have made a significant contribution to energy reduction and conservation in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The Government's second failure is in the area of agriculture.  Over the past number of years there has been a vast change in agriculture in this country and in the way in which the European Union relates to farming and agriculture, not only here but in other countries as well.  The Government has gone along with a system which effectively pays farmers to produce nothing, when in fact it could have promoted a system which would have encouraged farmers to switch to producing the very crops on which alternative fuels and biofuels could have been developed.  Why are farmers now being paid to produce nothing when there could have been a shift in production, which would not only have provided for a sustainable future for agriculture and rural communities in this country but which would also have made a large contribution to our environmental obligations and to securing fuel supplies on a sustainable basis in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Probably the biggest example of the Government's failure in this area relates to the sugar factories.  The sugar factories are being closed and put on the market for significant office, commercial and residential developments, at a time, I might add, when the privatised sugar company is refusing to pay the redundancy payments to its former workforce who made the company what it was in the first place.  Instead of those factories being turned into commercial buildings, businesses etc. and making a fortune for those who will benefit from the sugar company's privatisation, which is also a Fianna Fáil legacy, they could have been used for the production of biofuels — another missed opportunity by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The Government has delayed the implementation of public transport strategies which would reduce reliance on the private car.  In fact, in the course of the past couple of weeks this country has been criticised again by the European Environment Agency for its pattern of development, which is resulting in sprawl and in a dispersed form of settlement reliant on private transport and resulting in increased problems and an increased burden in terms of our Kyoto commitments.  The Government of course has great plans for public transport.  We have heard and will hear over the next number of months leading into the general election, of nothing but Transport 21.  This is also fairy tale stuff, which is being pumped out in advance of the election and contrasts badly with the Government's record of delivery over ten years in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">After the litany of failures, we will end up by not meeting our Kyoto commitments.  The Minister says that it does not really matter because we do not make a big contribution to global pollution anyway.  He said that if all Irish emissions were to shut down overnight, the impact would be lost in a matter of hours.  In other words, he is telling the House——</p>

          <p eId="para_161">——that it really does not matter; we can continue to pollute but because we now have money we can buy the right to pollute from poorer people.  Carbon allowances and credits come from a framework whereby we have three worlds on this globe.  A quarter of the world's population does not have electricity.  These are poor people who are not contributing to global warming through carbon emissions.  Carbon allowances and credits mean that wealthy countries such as ours can continue to pollute.  The Minister says we have to protect our industry and we must, but basically he is saying that we can continue to pollute and will buy the share of pollution that would have been produced by poorer people who cannot afford to do it.  That is what buying carbon credits is about.  It is a form of environmental imperialism.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_163">The Government's attitude is to say that since we are not contributing much to pollution anyway, we can buy our way out of it.  There are two problems with that, however.  The first is that buying our way out of it will cost Irish taxpayers a lot of money.  At a conservative estimate it will cost €500 million between now and 2012, which might otherwise be available for hospitals, schools, care of the elderly and many other social requirements.  Instead of that, taxpayers' money will be used so that certain industries, some of which are particularly favoured by the Government, can continue to pollute.  The second problem is that it completely undermines our international position.  As the Minister said, this is an international problem.  Ireland should be providing moral leadership on the issue, as it has done in the past on so many global causes.  It is an embarrassment that we are so far behind in our delivery on Kyoto that we have been silenced on global warming, the greatest issue facing the planet.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The Government will have no credibility in addressing international conferences and making a contribution on global warming while we continue to be so far in excess of our limits.  Ireland continues to be criticised by the European Union and the European Environmental Agency for its performance.  The Government has adopted a "pollute now, pay later" attitude, which it is standing over.  That is particularly regrettable in the context of where energy will come from in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">A renewed debate is taking place on the question of nuclear energy.  Across the water the United Kingdom's Government has already made certain moves in the direction of renewing its nuclear programme.   Given the long-standing position that this country has taken against nuclear energy, which the Minister says he supports, and given the difficulties we continue to have with handling nuclear waste and pollution from Sellafield and other installations, Ireland needs to be able to make a credible statement concerning the shift to nuclear energy which is now taking place in the UK and elsewhere.  We are silenced on the issue, however, because we are now seen as one of the dirty players in Europe.  Because we are at the worst end of the league table in terms of lowering carbon emissions, we cannot with any credibility tell other countries they should not produce electricity from nuclear sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">This is a bad day for the country.  The motion before the House may appear obscure, rather like other motions seeking approval for international agreements that come before us from time to time, but it is a watershed for the country.  It is the start of the Irish people having to pay financial and environmental costs for the Government's failure to honour its commitments under the Kyoto Agreement over the past ten years.  It has not done its job of getting carbon emissions under control.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I first became aware of climate change a long time ago, in the late 1970s when I was barely out of short trousers.  I read an influential book called <i>Eco Science </i>by two American authors who pointed out that climate change was an important issue.  They wrote about the hole in the ozone layer, air pollutants and other problems facing the planet on a global scale.  We have been able to address some of those challenges.  The hole in the ozone layer is repairing itself.  We no longer put chlorofluorocarbons into every aerosol or fridge.  If there is an interest in tackling a global problem we can solve it, but the Government does not realise the importance of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">We tend to joke about climate change in Ireland.  When we get a warm October, people say "Ah, let's have more of this stuff; isn't it great?", but climate change is a deadly serious issue.  In Darfur, tens of thousands of people are dying from drought that can be attributed wholly or partly to climate change.  In the Pacific Ocean, the populations of island nations are facing the prospect of emigration to survive.  We have already seen islanders from that area being transferred to New Zealand.  When storms hit Bangladesh, rising sea levels cause thousands of deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Climate change, therefore, is a deadly problem that must be taken seriously.  I am concerned that the Minister is sleep-walking on the issue and failing to treat it with the gravity it deserves.  The Minister is the Neville Chamberlain of his time.  He is coming back off the plane from Nairobi with a press release in his hand which says "It's all right folks, we have it under control".  I do not think he realises the importance of the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">The Minister needs a reality check.  He expresses an interest in hybrid cars and then purchases a Lexus, which is the Exxon Valdez of the hybrid world.  The Minister could set a better example.  There are three options for tackling climate change.  We can make reductions here at home, we can buy carbon on the international market or we can buy our way into reducing emissions elsewhere, and we are talking about the latter option today.  That involves investment in projects in countries such as Kazakhstan — what I would call the Borat buy-out — and it is not the worst option.  We are not saying it should not happen, but it should not be done at the expense of failing to take action here.  That is our concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">On the other issue, two of the options require money belonging to taxpayers to be forked out.  It is necessary to buy one's way into it, whereas if reductions are made here in Ireland that is not required.  This is a no brainer with an obvious easy option yet, for some reason, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not doing anything about it.  He could improve building regulations saving us 1 million tonnes of carbon per year.  He could tackle urban sprawl so the European Environmental Bureau will no longer consider Ireland, and Dublin particularly, the poster boy of bad behaviour.  He could improve public transport and extend the Luas to the far flung suburbs of Dublin while also laying lines in Sligo, Cork and Limerick.  These are failures on the part of the Minister.  Every election sees the Minister suggesting a railway line to Navan and every five years sees more grass growing on the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">There is much to be done on this issue and I am not sure we have the right Minister or the right Government to do it.  The Minister's term paper was submitted in recent days and it was sent back with the observation "more work required".</p>

          <p eId="para_185">It is quite obvious, from the outset, that environmental protection has never been high on the Government agenda.  Implementation of EU environmental directives has been characterised by foot dragging, missed deadlines and warnings from the European Commission in areas such as the widespread pollution of drinking water, habitat damage, failure to submit reports on substances that damage the ozone layer, climate change and the failure to nominate areas of natural conservation importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Under the Kyoto Protocol this State must not let greenhouse gas emissions rise by more than 13% of the 1990 level and it is currently running at 23% above the agreed target.  The Government failure to take the action necessary to curb greenhouse emissions in this State will result, according to preliminary projections, in the State facing estimated fines of more than €100 million, and possibly as high as €180 million, for failure to reduce emissions outputs in line with Kyoto Protocol commitments.  These figures could quadruple thereafter.  Taxpayers and not the big industrial polluters will end up carrying the resulting financial burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">There is a lack of concern at Government level with actually achieving reductions in emissions.  Responsible states should not resort solely to emissions trading and it should be remembered that the Exchequer will benefit from any actions which result in a reduction in emissions.  We should be aiming beyond the Kyoto Protocol, which merely represents a minimum level with which all states should be complying.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Environmental non-governmental organisations have raised concerns regarding carbon trading schemes introduced as part of the Kyoto Protocol.  They have pointed to failures in accounting, dubious science and the destructive impact of projects on local peoples and environments in developing countries, as reasons why trading pollution rights should be avoided.  Perhaps the Government should take heed of their calls to make reductions at the source of pollution and develop energy policies that are justice based and community driven.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">It is obvious that a number of measures need to be implemented at the earliest opportunity to address the growth of emissions in this State.  The Twenty-Six Counties is facing enormous fines or alternatively will be forced to spend huge amounts of revenue, taxpayers' money, on emissions trading.  Responsible states should not resort solely to emission trading and it should be remembered that the Exchequer will benefit from any actions which result in a reduction in emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Only yesterday the European Commission said Ireland's national allocation plan for the amount of harmful emissions released during the 2008-12 trading period must be reduced by 6.4% and also found that the State has not made enough progress in its arrangements for compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.  In particular, the Government's decision not to impose carbon taxes means the burden of paying penalties, estimated at €300 million per year, will fall on the general body of taxpayers rather than on the main offenders, notably in the transport sector.  This is not what was envisaged in the Government's 1999 national climate change strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">This Government must build on the Kyoto Protocol and strengthen its positive points and then further commit itself to greater cuts in emissions post 2012.  Sinn Féin supports a phased introduction of carbon taxes directed at those agents most capable of making the change from high to low emission fuels.  This is not to say we support carbon taxes in all cases, only where it can be proven that such a tax would be effective in reducing emissions.  It is obvious that a number of measures need to be implemented at the earliest opportunity to address the growth of emissions in this State or else we will cause irreparable damage to our environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I do not believe any country in the world is defined by and associated with a colour as Ireland, the Emerald Isle, is.  The understanding of the word green has developed in recent years and people believe that Ireland should have a clean, green environment, rather than merely use the term as a marketing ploy.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Ireland has exported a great deal of its population around the world and they have been highly successful in building other countries and resolving problems in those places.  I do not believe for a moment that this genius is no longer available in this country.  The €20 million set aside for carbon credits is the lazy way out and we can do much better.  I listened to the Minister's speech and felt he came across as very enthusiastic when describing sound environmental investment, the problem is it is to be found elsewhere.  We want that investment to be made in Ireland so carbon credits need not be used as an escape route from our responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Most people do not realise we are buying our way out of this problem rather than dealing with it locally in a structured, strategic way by accelerating delivery of the public transport programme and addressing energy waste through building regulations.  This is the lazy way out and the public is way ahead on this issue.  The Minister may dispute the European Commission's exact comments but they were not favourable and must not be ignored.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">The public is making its own arrangements on public transport by mixing modes of transport.  People are leaving their cars close to train stations so that public transport can be used for, at least, one leg of their journey.  Spending on car parks around train stations is not seen as investment but rather a drain on public funds and it has been suggested that commuters be charged to park at train stations instead of it being seen as a benefit.  Feeder bus services, that would avoid the necessity to use such car parks, are seen merely as something that will cost money, yet we are willing to invest in other countries by buying ourselves out of our traffic jams through carbon credits.  That is essentially what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I am not opposed to cars.  The problem is one of car use as opposed to car ownership.  The Netherlands is a good example of a country which, despite high levels of car ownership, has balanced car use.  I was a member of one of the panels of the Dublin Transportation Office when it examined the connection between transport and land use.  This involved carrying out scenario testing to determine the best case scenario for the city.  Although a range of good scenarios were presented to the panel, the practical outcome in Dublin, the dispersed pattern of development which is driving up demand for private cars as a means of transportation, is the worst case scenario.  In buying carbon credits we are paying the price for some of the disgraceful decisions made on development.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">While I welcome recent initiatives on home heating systems, much more could be done.  I have been contacted by several constituents considering installing solar panels who were uncertain as to whether they require planning permission.  We must consider the hoops that end users are forced to go through to avail of the incentives in place.  Such schemes must be more widely available and easier to use.  We must take a carrot rather than a stick approach to encouraging use of beneficial technologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">If politicians were to state in their election manifestos that our failure to provide solutions to easily resolved problems will mean that by 2012 personal taxation levels will have to increase or public services will have to be cut back to meet the considerable costs involved in emissions trading, people would revolt.  This is, however, the predictable outcome of our behaviour.  We are starting on the back foot by taking the easy way out.  Ireland can do much better.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">I welcome the decision to extend the debate to accommodate Deputies, including me, who wish to contribute.  On a minor technical issue, there appears to be a slight conflict of interest in terms of the conduct of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Given that Ireland is a member of the bank, which will raise funds for its operations through the fees imposed on transactions, is it appropriate that the EBRD should suggest selling us carbon credits?</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Climate change and carbon trading are difficult issues.  The carbon trading market does not operate successfully.  While I accept that we are groping in the dark, the international phenomenon of climate change requires an international response.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">A sense of proportion is required on whether Ireland has honoured its commitments and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.  Steps are being taken to reduce our carbon emissions.  We face a major challenge because most of our economic growth took place after the benchmarking process under which our emissions ceiling was set.  As the Minister noted, Ireland has successfully decoupled pollution and emissions from the rate of economic growth.  This welcome development should not be overlooked.  Irrespective of whether it is attributable to changes in agriculture or large industry, it is a significant achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">One could conclude from other contributions that Ireland is a major polluter.  A sense of perspective is required on the amount of emissions we create.  This does not absolve us from our duties at international level and we must show good example.  As the Minister indicated, the purchase of carbon credits forms part of the mix of our approach to addressing climate change.  This type of safety mechanism, while a wise investment, should not deflect us from the long-term consequences of the problem.  It is irrelevant to climate change and global warming whether emissions are produced in Ireland, eastern Europe or the United States.  The problem is caused by the accumulation of emissions across the globe.  Ireland must take responsibility and show leadership on how we tackle the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Today's edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> highlights the failures and shortcomings of the emissions trading system.  An article on the topic notes that British industries will be allowed to emit more carbon dioxide in 2008 than they did in 2005 under a ruling delivered by the European Commission yesterday.  This is a failure by any measure as we should not take backward steps.  The same article notes that the United Kingdom proposed stringent emission controls in the first round in a move designed to make the second round less strict.  This will have a negative global effect, which clearly demonstrates that the trading mechanism does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">From the tone of the debate, one would be forgiven for believing that the Minister was responsible for the failure of the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I will address the issue of building regulations later.  On the emissions trading scheme, Ireland has major responsibilities in this regard.  The focus of the system appears to be on industry.  In truth, however, the majority of carbon emissions are produced in the transport sector.  This creates a major challenge arsing from our economic prosperity and affluence.  While emissions standards in cars have improved significantly, the trend towards acquiring high powered cars has offset the benefits of reduced engine emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I hope the budget will include measures which encourage people to choose a greener option when purchasing cars.  I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have advised the Minister for Finance on the matter.  We must provide incentives, while also addressing the problem of congestion, one of the major contributors to carbon emissions, by investing in public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Rock Road in my constituency will soon have a new quality bus corridor.  Although I am, in principle, a great fan of quality bus corridors and welcomed the introduction of a QBC on the Stillorgan dual carriageway, I did so because the road was of an appropriate size.  It is one of the successes of the Dublin transport initiative.  I worry about what will happen on the Rock Road which runs parallel to the DART station.  I accept, as do many of my constituents, that we cannot travel the roads like we did.  I enjoy the privilege of a car parking space here, a privilege many other people do not have, but we must make changes.  If I am to sell a QBC to my constituents, however, saying it is a good thing, not just because of climate change but because of convenience, we will need more buses.  Those buses do not necessarily need to be publicly owned.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">Ireland faces difficult questions over the issue of excise duty on aviation fuel because of our island position.  It must be considered as one of the challenges we face in dealing with climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I agree with Deputy Gilmore that we must have more stringent building regulations.  I visited a school in my constituency that was built 30 years ago.  The principal of that school was worried about the heating bill for the school just as the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann had introduced their increases of 20% and 34%.  We must incentivise public buildings to restore roofs and install insulation to allow them to reduce their heating bills.  We must also provide for such measures in the regulations for new buildings.  If we had stricter regulations, we could save up to 22% of our energy costs.  Prevention is always better than cure.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I listened to Professor Des O'Neill speaking in the Joint Committee on Health and Children about the value of the medical card for the over 70s.  While giving a card to everyone regardless of need may be an expensive way to achieve something, he pointed out that it has reduced need because it has encouraged people to adopt preventative instead of curative measures.  He said it represents great value for money so we must apply the same principle to energy use.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I am confident, therefore, that the budget next week will contain measures to encourage people in their houses and cars to reduce consumption.  That is how we will make progress with carbon emissions.  The Government has a duty to encourage and inform people and I commend the Power of One campaign, which has made people reflect on energy use and consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources produced a report earlier this year in which we indicated that we would like to see a debate on the use of nuclear energy.

The situation regarding emissions that he inherited could have been addressed by his Government in a series of different ways in the past five years but it failed to do so.  The Kyoto Agreement has been in place for the duration of this and the previous Government, but only token measures were taken.  The obvious thing to do once that agreement was signed was to develop the alternative energy sector but it was not done.</p>

This should have been funded instead by developing the alternative energy industry.

If the Government did not embark on the carbon trading it would be forced to pay the fines at some stage, substantially in excess of the amounts raised in the increased price of gas and electricity and substantially in excess of any amount likely to be invested from now on in the alternative energy sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">The Minister is correct.  We should be realistic in considering what we can do about emissions.  We can develop the alternative energy sector and invest in it.  This sector should not be developed by way of increasing the price of all fuels so that it becomes impossible to live in the country.  The Minister knows well there is serious doubt about what is happening at present.  He will not admit it in the House but he knows it in his heart of hearts.  It was decided in the past two or three months to increase gas and electricity prices, allegedly, to encourage more people into the business and against the backdrop of internationally falling prices.  At every opportunity the Government is putting forward the notion that these increases might be reviewed and that this might be a good time to do so.  This is nonsense.  It is quite obvious that if they were that wrong the first time, they will be wrong the second time and any reduction by way of 5% will not be accepted or acceptable, nor should it be, because the increase should never have been made in the first place.  There should be an end to the nonsense and the issue should be dealt with in a realistic way.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I have become increasingly sickened in recent times that whenever one raises a question on energy or many other issues, the response is that the Minister is not responsible to the House.  It should be restated and condensed to say that the Minister is no longer responsible, full stop.  When we ask a question, we are entitled to an answer but the response is that the Minister is no longer responsible.  Of course we know he is no longer responsible.  Ministers have sought the opportunity to go around with their heads in the air, speaking on television and by means of news broadcasting services and they have failed to recognise that they are responsible to this House for every aspect of the legislation they put through the House in the past or proposed legislation.  I reject in its entirety the notion that the Minister has no responsibility.  The Minister has responsibility and the regulator and Minister between them have joint responsibilities regarding the appalling gas and electricity price increases they promoted in the past months.  I ask that both of them come forward with the revised decision as quickly as possible which will be much welcomed.  I regret we do not have more time to deal with this particularly important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I wish to make a final point about transport.  Much has been said about alternative transport.  The public will use alternative transport if it is there for them and if it is properly located.  I do not accept the notion that buses will be the ultimate answer.  I regard rail transport, especially in the environs of a city, as the answer.  I am not suggesting that more trains be put on the already crowded streets, on the basis that if it is made impossible for people to travel on the roads, there will be nothing left for them.  This is a rather peculiar attitude.  Trains should be deployed to provide maximum availability to the travelling public and it will be seen how well they will be utilised by the public.</p>

The Minister and the Government are to be commended on participating fully and rationally within the guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol.  The world in general has been very slow to react to the crisis that is climate change.  Many of us may only become aware of it when we see the results of drought in Africa shown on television or when watching the excellent television series "Planet Earth" presented by David Attenborough on BBC which shows the melting polar ice caps and the threat to animals in the polar regions.  Climate change is a serious issue.  It is regrettable that the international community has been so slow to accept what has become a consensus point of view within the scientific community but perhaps this is the way democracies work.  It is very regrettable that the United States has only been brought into this process, kicking and screaming and it gives me no pleasure to say this.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The Government is ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and limiting our greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above our 1990 levels.  We have successfully decoupled our economic growth from emissions.  Between 1990 and 2004, our emissions grew by 23% but our economy grew by almost 150%.  While statistics may be boring, this decoupling in our fast growing economy is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The challenge for the Government is maintaining the twin objectives of economic growth and a sound, safe environmental policy.  It is not easy, but it is the challenge we face.  Another speaker said he hoped incentives would be included in next week's budget.  I echo that.  I am quite confident that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have had ongoing dialogue with the Minister for Finance on this issue.  The only way we will effect real change is if people modify their behaviour.  We all know that people will only change their behaviour if they are incentivised to do so.  Why, by and large, do people not drive hybrid cars?  The answer is that they are generally not for sale and it is difficult to get the fuel for them in petrol stations.  If people were demanding those products, the companies would supply them.  There should be no excise duties on green cars.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">Let us tackle that for once and for all.  There should be serious incentives for the former beet growers to grow their produce for the purposes of alternative fuel.  Let us introduce serious tax incentives.  We seem to have developed a problem with the concept of tax incentives in recent years.  People have said that such incentives are bad and only benefit the rich.  That is balderdash.  When I started out in politics in 1985, the south inner city was a derelict place with hardly a new building being built there.  Were it not for the tax designation of many parts of this city, we never would have had the redevelopment of the capital.  Buildings that had not changed from the time of the Act of Union were dilapidating.  The same holds for all aspects of society, including agriculture.  The arguments, products and thinking must move on.  I hope to see radical change in the budget from the Minister for Finance in this area.  There is a huge public appetite for that.</p>

When I was a member of Dublin City Council I visited an incinerator in the Swedish city of Malmo, and they know a thing or two about the environment.  The incinerator burned rubbish and heated all the homes in Malmo.  The smoke from the incinerator was perfectly treated so that it could be safely released into the atmosphere.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Ó Snodaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I support the Kyoto Protocol and the flexible mechanisms contained within it.  However, we must be careful and cautious about how we use these mechanisms.  There is a concern that some of the clean development mechanisms could be used in a way that does not lead to real reduction; they must relate to reductions that otherwise would not have occurred.  Of the several hundred such mechanisms that have been developed, only two relate to Africa.  While that mechanism was supposed to help the poor, it is not doing so.  Like some of the other joint implementation mechanisms, it is taking up the easy carbon reductions that occurred in the early 1990s when the economies collapsed in former Soviet-bloc countries.  That is what we are doing.  We are in a state of denial on climate change.  This is the equivalent of a mid-morning shot of vodka for the Government to get us through the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I am concerned about these flexible mechanisms because they take time to get right.  These are due to come into operation at the end of 2008, but we are only now starting to examine investment in projects that, because of their nature, take years to set up, monitor and process.  We are coming to this incredibly late.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">We must think beyond the Kyoto target of 2012.  The Minister knows that the real debate is on what comes next.  The European Union has said that it is to reduce emissions by 2020 by at least 15% below 1990 levels, and the Taoiseach has supported that.  We know that our emissions in 2010 will be approximately 30% above the 1990 level.  We are effectively seeking a 45% cut in ten years.  It will be incredibly expensive for Ireland to buy its way out of this problem.  It will not be the €500 million over three years that Deputy Gilmore talked about, it will be €500 million per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">To meet our targets we must start changing now.  Every single investment decision we make must be carbon proofed.  Every road programme must be questioned and every energy policy must be changed.  We must realise that turning this State around by 180 degrees in a new direction is the only way we will meet this challenge.  The Government is being dishonest in that regard.  It is dishonest when it lauds the supposed reduction in recent years from 27% to 23% as a real achievement.  The Minister knows that only reason for this reduction was a statistical change in the base year and the closure of a number of factories, including IFI, Irish Steel and others.  We must start by being honest about what is happening.</p>

They will ask why the Government did not tell them climate change was such an important issue and why it made those investment decisions when it knew it was the wrong direction to take.

          <p eId="para_270">Carbon trading is not the answer to climate change.  A recently published analysis of carbon trading entitled Carbon Trading: A Critical Conversation on Climate Change, Privatisation and Power, argued that carbon trading slows the social and technological change needed to cope with global warming by unnecessarily prolonging the world's dependence on oil, coal and gas.  As many environmental justice organisations have pointed out, carbon trading is nothing more than the proliferation of the free market into environmental policy making.  As the former World Bank chief economist, Sir Nicholas Stern, put it, the very basis of emissions trading is the assigning of property rights to emitters and then allowing them to be traded — in other words, business can buy the right to pollute.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">In the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol, governments have handed out to industrialised countries alone several times more rights to the world's carbon cycling capacity than are available if global temperatures are not to rise by more than 2° Celsius.  Permits worth €170 billion have been given to 11,500 of the EU's largest polluters.  Even such a small increase as 2° Celsius could have catastrophic effects for the globe.  The industrialised north is buying its way out of its commitments to reduce emissions and the expense is being passed on to the consumer.  According to Feasta, a Dutch study has shown that electricity companies in four countries have already increased their prices to make the customers pay.  The current price of the permits and the generators were given for nothing to use in producing their power.  The cost to companies of buying their way out of their commitments will be borne by the consumers aggravating fuel poverty and hitting low income families the hardest.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I will focus on the fastest growing contributor to the State's greenhouse gas emission levels which has shown a growth rate of 144% between 1990 to 2004, namely, the transport sector.  It accounts for 18.4% of total greenhouse gas output in this State with road transport accounting for an estimated 93% of that sector's output.  Despite this, the Government's commitment to biofuels is minimal.  The target for biofuel substitution of 5.75% by 2020 is nothing other than pathetic.  What is all the more galling is that this State has, or perhaps could have, the potential to become one of the leaders in biofuel production.  I urge the Minister to look again at this area and to have more realistic targets we can achieve so that we can be a world leader in regard to biofuels.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I welcome the debate on the terms of the agreement between Ireland and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development on participation in the multilateral carbon credit fund.  It is a wake-up call for all Members of the Oireachtas.  Regardless of party politics, it is important we all adopt the green agenda because it is essential.  It is unacceptable to see Ministers having a go at members of the Green Party for the sake of it rather than examining its sensible proposals over the past 20 years.  We should be open and honest and accept that the Green Party has had a major influence on us in regard to green issues, the environment and health.  We should not be afraid to say it has been a major influence here and I commend it on the work it has done on this issue.  The Green Party has brought a section of the people along with it and it has shown leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">When I see Ministers on television or at conferences having a go at the Green Party for the sake it, I want to tell them to grow up, that it does not help their case and that the public sees through it as well.  It is important the Minister listens to, and learns from, his voters.  The members of the Green Party in this House have had a major influence on environmental and other such issues.  If somebody comes up with a sensible idea, regardless of the party to which he or she belongs, all Members of the Oireachtas should support it.  That is my solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I strongly support the Kyoto Protocol and many of the contributions made by Deputies.  However, as well as leaders in Government showing leadership, we must also look at industrialists in this State, the leadership they show and at the way they deal with their responsibilities in regard to emissions and the environment.  They have a responsibility and a duty to do something about their patch.  The transport industry must also face up to its responsibility because it is having a negative impact on this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The Irish economy is less energy and material intensive per unit of GDP than it was several years ago.  However, absolute pressures on the environment have continued to increase, although less rapidly than GDP.  Ireland continues to face many environmental challenges, in particular, controlling air emissions from transport and energy production, reducing pollution, loading water for municipal and agricultural sources, improving waste management and nature protection.  Major environmental considerations affect all sectors of social and economic activity, transcend geographical boundaries and impact on regions, counties and the planet as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">In each sector, the importance of the environmental agenda is growing, which is very important.  Perhaps the biggest issue facing the energy and transport sectors is emissions of CO2 and other atmospheric pollutants while the biggest issue in local government is waste management.  Increasingly, in industry, it is a combination of the two.  In commercial and industrial sectors, where historically care for the environment has depended on good corporate citizenship, new economic and fiscal measures are making the environment a fundamental business issue.  That is something that should be pointed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Another important issue, which has arisen in the context of the peace process, is an all-island dimension to the environment.  There is a clear logic for North-South co-operation on environmental policy and action.  Water courses do not stop at borders and the management of waste is a growing problem on the island as a whole.  There is a strong rationale for sharing best practice across the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I encourage the Minister and the Government not to fill in the 52 acres of Dublin Bay.  One of the best environmentalists to become a Member of this House was Seán Dublin Bay Loftus.  I will continue to push the green agenda in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I thank Deputies for their contributions, although I disagreed with many of them.  Deputies asked what we were doing.  Many of them are in denial that we are doing anything, which is quite astonishing.  I will outline some of the things which have been done.  On energy, for example, the renewal energy support system is facilitating connection of renewal energy to the grid.  Deputies know that, although they can deny the truth.  Ireland will meet its EU targets to generate 13% of its electricity from renewable resources saving €1.3 million in terms of emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">In agriculture, for example, I said that CAP reform and the nitrates programme will reduce emissions by 2.4%.  Forestry will reduce emissions by 2.08 million tonnes.  Despite what a number of Deputies said, it is simply untrue that nothing is happening in regard to buildings.  As the House knows, we have introduced progressive and ongoing measures to improve energy efficiency in homes.  Energy certification of buildings is being phased in next year.  Budget 2006 established the highly successful green house grant scheme.  The Government introduced support for businesses to switch to renewable energy.  Also, we recently initiated the national energy efficiency campaign, the Power of One.  All of these make a significant contribution.</p>

We are here discussing carbon credits.  A succession of Deputies have come into the House and said they support the Kyoto Agreement, yet the issue of carbon credits is fundamental to that agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">With regard to carbon credits, one of the big issues in Sir Nicholas Stern's report concerns how the carbon credit mechanism can and will work and will be the best way forward.  We should also listen to what Mr. Al Gore and Kofi Annan have to say on the matter.  Kofi Annan argued at length in Nairobi for the proper use of carbon credits, and to that extent I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Tony Blair has also put the case.  The European Commission in its report on Ireland yesterday argued the case for us getting on with the job of purchasing carbon credits.  The issue was also central last week in Nairobi.</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_428">Deputy O'Connor was speaking when the debate adjourned yesterday.  He has seven minutes remaining.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I welcome this opportunity to speak for a second time in this debate.  I made a brief contribution yesterday.  I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of many eminent Deputies, not only from Fianna Fáil but also from other parties.  It is encouraging that they want to hear me speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">When I listened to the speech made yesterday by Deputy Perry, in which he mentioned every street in Sligo, I was reminded that it is alright to be parochial when speaking in the House.  Therefore, I have decided to speak about Tallaght during the seven minutes available to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">As I said yesterday, it is important that we support the work of the Garda Síochána, for example by ensuring it has proper resources and facilities, while ensuring the force is doing its job properly.  I gave some examples yesterday of the effective deployment of friendly gardaí on our streets.  The members of the force are doing their jobs by delivering the services demanded of them by communities.  It is important that we support the Garda in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I live in Tallaght, which is the third largest centre of population in the country.  I often make the point that there is just one Garda station within the boundaries of my constituency, which has a population of almost 70,000.  Parts of Dublin South-West are served by the Garda stations in Rathfarnham, Clondalkin and Crumlin, as well as Tallaght Garda station, which is in the constituency.  Some of the stations I have mentioned were also referred to yesterday.  It is important that we understand the need for the Garda to continue to have excellent facilities and first-class resources so it can offer communities the friendly, effective and efficient service they want.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I mention the ongoing campaign for the redevelopment of Tallaght Garda station, which was built in 1987.  The Garda station was in place before many of the other services in the Tallaght region.  I often make the point that Tallaght did not fall out of the sky 30 years ago — it has been there forever.  I often said, after the new Tallaght came on stream in the 1970s, that it had the population of a city and the status of a village.  We needed many of the new facilities which are in place today, thank God.  The Garda station in Tallaght, which was the first building of its type to be developed in Tallaght, is now outdated.  If one examines the history of the community of Tallaght over the past 16 years, one will note that it has benefitted from many of the developments one would expect in a new city.  I refer to The Square shopping centre, Tallaght Hospital and many sporting and cultural facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">We need to focus on providing first-class facilities for the Garda to allow it to provide its various services.  In any debate, other Deputies will make the case for the provision of such services in their constituencies, as they have done on this occasion, and I am certainly making the case for my constituency.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will be aware, I have argued on a number of occasions that a second Garda station is needed in Tallaght.  I will continue to make the point that such a Garda station should be located in west Tallaght.  Members of the House from all constituencies will agree that police visibility is important.  Just as people like to see politicians visiting their communities occasionally, they like to see gardaí on the streets on a regular basis.  I mentioned yesterday that I came from a different Dublin where when I was growing up, I used to see gardaí on foot and on their bicycles, and threatening to confiscate our footballs, and so on.  It is important that we understand the value of such engagement with the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I am a strong supporter of the concept of police forums.  It is important that we encourage the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to promote that concept.  People in my constituency were disappointed that it was not selected for inclusion in the pilot programme, especially in light of the size of Dublin South-West and the Tallaght area, in particular.  I remind the Minister of State, as I have often reminded the Tánaiste, that progress needs to be made with the programme.  That will happen if community groups and activists engage with local leaders, gardaí and public representatives to discuss the various issues.  I am sure my colleagues, Deputies Costello and English, agree with me on the basis of the experience in their constituencies.  I imagine that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, thinks that such a process would be of assistance in Galway.  We need to continue to emphasise the importance of developments like police forums.  We need to keep the public on board.  Having lived in Dublin for most of my life, I have always taken the view that it is important for the Garda to engage with the public.  If such engagement does not take place and the Garda fails to do an effective and efficient job, alternative means of justice start to become evident in local areas.  We are all familiar with examples of such activity, which we should try to resist.  In that context, it is important to support the work of the Garda in a strong way.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I had an opportunity a couple of years ago to join some of my parliamentary colleagues on a trip to London.  The Minister had arranged for the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to visit Scotland Yard and to learn about policing projects in that great city.  We saw the value of various innovative approaches to policing, including the involvement of reserve constables and what we might call community gardaí.  There are many different views about such concepts.  As part of that trip, Deputy Finian McGrath — I hope he does not mind me mentioning him again — and I went on a patrol in the suburbs with members of the Metropolitan Police.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">This has been an important debate.  I am pleased to have participated in it yesterday and again today.  It is important that we support the Garda, while pointing out the need for continued discipline and reform.  I am happy to do that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_218">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_442">I always have great respect for the words of wisdom of the honourable Member from Tallaght.  It is worth learning about what is happening on the ground in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">This is an important debate, as Deputy O'Connor said.  We read in the newspapers every day about matters relating to the behaviour of members of the Garda Síochána.  Such matters are of concern to communities throughout the country.  It is time to address this issue.  It was reported yesterday that the Garda Commissioner had sacked two gardaí who misbehaved while they were on security duty outside the United States Embassy in Dublin.  The gardaí in question left their posts, went drinking in a local public house, had a personal dispute about the purchase of a round of drinks and ended up engaging in a bout of fisticuffs on the streets in full view of the staff of the embassy and some bemused members of the public.  When one of the gardaí got into his car to drive home, he was stopped and charged with drink driving.  Such "wild west" behaviour might seem like a rip-roaring comedy of errors, but it is unthinkable that two members of a modern, professional and efficient police force who were engaged in serious and important official duty outside a foreign embassy should act in such an irresponsible and indisciplined fashion in the middle of the day, in full view of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">A sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights published its findings in respect of the various Barron reports yesterday.  The finding of the sub-committee that was the subject of the most headlines was that there was collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in the cases of certain murderous bombings in the Republic in the mid-1970s.  This is the fourth report to be published and I was involved in the first three.  We came across serious issues of incompetence and negligence by the Garda.  There was a failure to pursue investigations, a failure to contact or consult bereaved families, as well as an unexplained loss of documents and evidence and a failure to protect the scene of the crime.  All these issues were part of what was going on 30 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">More recently the Morris tribunal reports highlighted levels of garda insubordination, indiscipline and corruption that are mind-boggling and that border on betrayal of the uniform and the oath.  In the past five years, 57 members of the Garda Síochána have been sacked or have resigned as an alternative to being dismissed.  Moreover, Garda effectiveness in police work has deteriorated rapidly.  The detection rate has dropped from a relatively satisfactory 46% in 1998 to an unsatisfactory 34% in 2005.  The early ideals of the Garda Síochána have been badly tarnished by significant sectors of the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">When the London Metropolitan Police Force was established in 1829, its first commissioners, Rowan and Maguire, wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_447">Every member of the force must remember that his duty is to protect and help members of the public, no less than to apprehend guilty persons.  Consequently, whilst prompt to prevent crime and arrest criminals, he must look upon himself as the servant and guardian of the general public and treat all law-abiding citizens, irrespective of their social positions, with unfailing patience, courtesy and good humour.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">These sentiments mirror the statement of Michael Staines, the first Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in 1922, when he said that "the Garda Síochána will succeed not by force of arms but by their moral authority as servants of the people".  That was why we had an unarmed police force, which was unique at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The restoration of the Garda Síochána to its former integrity can only begin to be achieved by establishing a Patten style commission on policing into the role, culture and structures of the Garda Síochána in the 21st century.  A root and branch overhaul is urgently required.  Nothing less will do.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has funked the challenge and provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 merely tinkered with the problems.  There is no democratic oversight or accountability mechanism to direct, manage and hold the Garda Síochána to account at all times.  The inspectorate, though laudable, is little more than an extension of the role of the Minister, acts on his instructions and reports to him.  Likewise the ombudsman, though equally laudable, will deal with individual cases of complaint and will not be retrospective in its operation.  Neither the inspectorate nor the ombudsman will direct, manage or hold the force accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">A Garda authority is essential to do all those things which the two new bodies cannot do, but as such an authority does not exist, there will be no ongoing democratic management, no supervision, no accountability and no direction provided to gardaí.  The Garda Commissioner, the Minister and the Department will continue to rule just as before.  A Garda authority is only a means to an end and is an effective democratic management tool.  It will not of itself transform the force.  It will not restore it to the ideals of its early days.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform turned his face against the only measure that could have transformed the force, restored its morale and made it an efficient professional and modern police force with ideals and integrity.  He has lost a golden opportunity which may not be so readily available to a future Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">It is time to establish an independent commission on policing in Ireland.  It would be similar to the independent commission on policing which was set up under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999 to create "a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole".  Its terms of reference would require the identification and the setting up of new structures to ensure accountability, independent scrutiny and partnership with the community.  Its methodology would involve a comprehensive consultative process.  A public debate on policing in the 21st century would be initiated.  The commission would take the debate to the highways and byways of the country.  It would engage local communities in local parish halls across Ireland.  Those professionally involved in policing would be consulted and best international practice would be ascertained.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The findings of the Patten Commission<b> </b>constitute a valuable resource and reservoir of material that can be drawn from and adopted.  The Patten Commission was given 12 months to conduct its work and I believe that the new commission could complete its work in six to nine months.  The process is crucial and a lasting new police culture of service can only be delivered if a sense of participation, responsibility and ownership is engendered in the consultative process.  That applies to the public and to members of the force.  They must participate and be engaged in the future of their service.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Education and training of Garda recruits has been carried out in Templemore College, County Tipperary, since the foundation of the State.  The college in Templemore has served the country well and is internationally respected for the quality of work it does.  It is located in a rural idyllic setting which is conducive to tranquil learning.  The Minister recently constructed a four-storey extension to enable the training of an extra 2,000 recruits in the next couple of years.  It is time we reviewed the role of the college in Templemore as the sole centre for the training and education of gardaí.  A historic opportunity exists to locate a second Garda education and training centre in Grangegorman on the north side of Dublin.  The Dublin Institute of Technology is building the largest third level college in the country on the Grangegorman site.  A Garda Síochána college or a police academy could easily become the seventh faculty of the DIT.  The 65-acre site has 30 acres of playing fields and will have a wide range of sporting facilities installed.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The site is in an inner city urban setting and reflects the general context in which most policing work is carried out.  Modern Ireland has rapidly changed from rural to urban in character.  Garda students would mix and interact with their peers in other third level disciplines, not just with their trainee colleagues.  It is ideally located for in-service courses and for research studies in such areas as policing methods, crime statistics, criminology, substance abuse and community policing.  All of these could be established and an integrated policy dimension could be added.  It should be possible to share some facilities with the PSNI and to establish a link with the new police college in Northern Ireland.  We could examine providing a centre of excellence for police forces from further afield.  A Garda college in Dublin would not replace the Templemore college but add an extra dimension that would make the Garda Síochána a modern and professional force in tune with the best policing practice anywhere in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I have come from the National Forum on Europe where I represent the Labour Party.  The Chairman of that forum, Senator Maurice Hayes, was a valuable member of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland and drew up the proposals for the ombudsman in the North.  People think the ombudsman was part of the Patten commission proposals and do not realise that Senator Maurice Hayes had already developed the proposals before Patten had begun.  He is a man with great expertise and experience.  The forum model is interesting.  It includes representatives of the Government parties and national Government organisations and the public is entitled to come and make submissions.  It gives us an idea of what we could do if we were to engage in a proper dialogue on the future of policing in this country.  Unfortunately we have not done that to date and it is time we did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_456">I intend to share time equally with Deputies Morgan and Gregory.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Is mian liom labhairt ar an rún an-tábhachtach seo, mar is ábhar é seo a bhíonn idir lámha agus á phlé ag a lán daoine ar fud mo dháilcheantair.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Costello, tá ceist an ombudsman lárnach in aon sórt athbhreithnithe nó athstruchtúraithe, chomh maith le smachtú ó thaobh iompair de don Gharda.  I have met the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Nuala O'Loan.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I will not repeat what Deputy Costello said.  There is already a good range of experience and a model for how we could proceed and it is amazing that our Government has not taken note of the effectiveness of the Police Ombudsman's office in the North more clearly.  Perhaps there are other reasons for this, which I do not have time to go into.  It disappoints people that the model in the North has not been more clearly followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">There is a lack of progress on Garda resourcing in many other areas and we need to focus on that too.  I have spoken to members of the force who do not wish to be quoted publicly and they have made it clear that there is great frustration on a number of levels.  There is a resourcing mismatch.  The Bellanaboy issue, with which the Minister is familiar, indicates a mismatch on the numbers of gardaí, who are needed in other parts of the country, being billeted in the Bellanaboy area and their behaviour.  There was an investigation into the over-the-top reaction of gardaí there, which may be dealt with elsewhere.  I do not want to prejudice that investigation by anything that is said here.  Statistics show that the number of gardaí per person in the Dublin metropolitan area is 283, while in the eastern region I represent as part of my constituency of Dublin North there are 483 gardaí per person.  In terms of the expectations and what they must deal with we ask gardaí outside the Dublin metropolitan area to work almost twice as hard as those inside, a fact which is clearly evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I have already dealt with the population explosion in the areas to which I refer.  Swords is equal in size to Waterford city, Balbriggan to Clonmel, Skerries to Tullamore, Rush to Kilkenny city, Lusk to Athlone, Malahide and Portmarnock to Tralee, and Donabate, which does not even have a secondary school, is equal in size to Athy.  Many of these areas do not have full-time Garda stations.  Of that list only Swords, Balbriggan and Malahide have full-time stations, while the rest are closed for a large part of the day.  Yet these places are expected to make do with a level of policing that would not be tolerated in other areas.  That is a great injustice that is being perpetrated and perpetuated.  It is not just an operational matter but must have political accountability and is not being dealt with.  Would the Acting Chairman tell me when I have a minute left?</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The Louth-Meath area, of which Dublin North is part, lacks a drugs task force, crime prevention units and other basic modern policing needs.  Meanwhile the area is growing rapidly.  The comparisons with other cities around the country make that obvious.  It is not just an operational matter.  Operation Freeflow was dealt with from a political perspective but this is more important.  We are talking about life or death, murder in Swords, grenade attacks, abuse of young children and attempted abductions.  We need the necessary policing; we do not have it and that is the first port of call.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the various reports before us and on Garda accountability, discipline and training more generally.  Yesterday evening my colleague Deputy Ó Snodaigh used the short time available to him to focus on accountability failures and lack of discipline within the force.  He spoke of the importance of the whistleblowers' charter.  The Minister has indicated this is being developed.  It is essential that this charter be robust and effective and we hope the Minister and the Garda Commissioner take on board the advice of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties on this.  The ICCL's report entitled Implementing Morris: An Agenda for Change contains a range of other important recommendations.  I urge the Minister promptly to consider all these and to report his intentions on them to the Oireachtas including the reasons behind, and evidence supporting, any decision not to endorse and implement a recommendation contained in the ICCL report.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Deputy Ó Snodaigh also spoke of the faith so many of us will be placing in the newly established Garda Inspectorate and Garda Ombudsman Commission.  I agree with him and caution that they must be adequately resourced if they are to deliver on their potential to renew community confidence in the Garda.  According to the Estimates the Ombudsman Commission is to receive less money next year than its equivalent in the Six Counties, yet it is to oversee a significantly larger police force and three times the geographic area and population.  This does not add up.  If the Minister is committed to accountability and discipline in the police force will he offer a guarantee today that the Ombudsman Commission will open its doors to complainants on 1 January 2007?  I call on him to make this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The Barr report into the killing of Mr. John Carthy at Abbeylara by gardaí highlights a range of grave issues that must be addressed.  The report on the siege and the immediate period leading to his death makes it clear that there are urgent training needs in the force including dealing with people with mental health issues and the management of situations involving firearms.  At this year's annual general meeting of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors the general secretary declared that Garda training on firearms is far behind international best practice.  Gardaí receive more training on how to clean a firearm than on how to manage a firearm situation.  My colleague tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister asking how he intended to rectify the grave shortcoming.  The Minister replied: "The Garda Commissioner has my full support in the provision of firearms facilities in the Garda Síochána up to international best practice".  There is no acknowledgement of the problem identified by the head of one of the larger Garda associations and no detailed plan on how it will be rectified.  Any objective analysis of the conduct of gardaí during the "Reclaim the Streets" protest and more recently at Ballinaboy, County Mayo makes clear the need for the development of a human rights complaints model for the policing of protests and for training to complement this.  On RTE news, the country witnessed gardaí at Ballinaboy throw a man over a barrier and into a six foot ditch.  He suffered grave injury.  Other serious Garda assaults on peaceful protesters also took place.  I hope we see these gardaí held to account and punished for their actions but, under this Government, I doubt that will happen.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_465">I support the establishment of a police authority referred to by the Minister yesterday.  He rejected this proposal on the basis that accountability should be through the Minister and the Garda Commissioner.  We are debating accountability because that system has failed dismally to deliver it.  A total transformation, of which an effective police authority is an essential part, is required, not the reformist steps the Minister is slowly taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I refer to one of the six reports before us, the Report of the Commission of Investigation (Dean Lyons case) by Mr. George Birmingham, a matter I have raised for many years during the tenure of various Ministers with responsibility for justice.  The case relates to the Grangegorman murders that occurred in my constituency.  When I raised the case in the House, I received replies from different Ministers that no such inquiry was required.  So much for accountability through the Garda Commissioner and the Minister.  A blatant case of injustice was raised on numerous occasions but we were told no inquiry was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Granting the commission of investigation was a concession that had to be dragged out of the incumbent Minister.  He stated he saw no case for it but the commission was allowed after the case was raised repeatedly.  Where is the accountability in this report?  There is no action by the Minister except setting up what he calls an expert group to examine interviewing procedures.  No one is held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The report is thorough in its detail but its conclusions are questionable and raise more questions than they answer.  The Minister's comments on the Dean Lyons report are selective and skirt over the more damning aspects.  The Minister accepts the conclusion that there was no deliberate attempt to undermine the rights of Dean Lyons.  That sentence must be considered.  Three months after recommending that Dean Lyons be charged with the murder of one woman, after Mark Nash had confessed in great detail to the murders, the investigating Garda team advised the DPP to proceed with the charge and add a murder charge in respect of the second woman.  Was there no attempt to undermine the rights of Dean Lyons?  The second recommendation is described by Mr. Birmingham as "extremely difficult to understand and even harder to justify".  No one is held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Were the gardaí who interviewed Dean Lyons untrained and inexperienced?  They were the most senior gardaí at the time, including Chief Superintendent Seán Camon, head of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation; Chief Superintendent Dick Kelly, head of the Garda district with responsibility for the constituency I represent; and Detective Superintendent Cormac Gordon who was promoted to Chief Superintendent after this episode and is now in charge of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  This is a feature of such matters, where gardaí are promoted rather than being subject to disciplinary measures.  These people insisted on proceeding with a charge of double murder against an unfortunate heroin addict despite the fact that junior investigating officers repeatedly advised that Dean Lyons's first statement had no detail, the second statement was unsound and that the charge should not proceed unless new evidence was found.  Junior investigating gardaí persistently recommended this to senior gardaí but senior gardaí now deny this ever happened despite various Garda witnesses.  This is a situation similar to Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I am pleased the Minister is now in the Chamber.  Why have no disciplinary measures been taken against these gardaí?  It is a simple question.  None of us likes the idea of public inquiries but the conclusions in this investigation create more questions than are answered and make the case for a fuller inquiry.  The relatives of the victims also feel their voices were not heard during the investigation.  They are deeply concerned that nobody has yet been charged with one of the most horrific murders in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The parents of Dean Lyons feel very strongly that what happened to their unfortunate son has been the subject of yet another cover-up because of his lack of education, heroin addiction, homelessness and the fact that he was up against five very senior gardaí.  Those gardaí deny everything now and the Minister is prepared to let them away with it.  I find that very difficult to understand and hope that the Minister addresses it in his conclusion.  His few remarks about the Dean Lyons case yesterday simply skirted over these issues and failed to deal with them properly.  I would like to know what the Minister feels about the points I have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I accept that I have run into the next speaker's slot, but I am glad to have had the opportunity to have made those few points.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_473">There has been a fair extension of the time available and there is no rush on us.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on Garda reform, the reports on which I also welcome.  I acknowledge the time and knowledge the reports represent as a body of work.  The people whose actions led to the publication of the reports are patriots in the truest sense.  The whistleblowers who opened up the system and laid bare its faults did so not because they wanted to do harm or destroy it, but because they could see others doing harm and destroying the system.  Those who facilitated the whistleblowers must also be commended, including Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin.  All involved have demonstrated courage and patriotism and we owe them a great deal of thanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Speaking of patriots, I note that our gardaí have generally served the State well since its foundation.  They have done so day to day and without arms, which circumstance is almost unique in Europe.  It is to their credit and in some ways a tribute to their success.  While gardaí must have the ability to defend themselves we should try as much as possible to maintain the current system and preserve the type of society in which unarmed policing is possible.  The State and the Garda force which has defended it were formed more than 80 years ago.  We are already well into the 21st century and must ensure that the values of truth, honour, courage and determination continue to be the hallmarks of Garda service and those who direct and manage it for the next 80 years also.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The concept of public service is inherent in the values set out.  Those who have been found to have done wrong failed in their duty and forgot that being a garda is about public service.  It is an issue we must consider across the board, from the Garda to the health service and politics and encourage the notion that we are talking here about the desire to serve one's country.  If one takes a job as a public servant working for the State, one's first duty is to serve.  This has been forgotten in many of our public institutions, including Departments and the Garda, where people have forgotten that their jobs are not about preventing people from obtaining help, but to facilitate them.  Public service is about doing the right thing by the country and its citizens.  We can set out all the procedures we want for Departments, the HSE and other bodies, but if people do not believe their duty is to serve, we will fail in our goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The point has been missed across the board, not just in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and people are forgetting that they are public servants.  We have a great deal of work to do to turn that state of affairs around.  The Minister is one person who knows about being a public servant and he has a desire to serve.  He could do other work anywhere he wanted, which makes him an example of the values we need to instill throughout the ranks in the various arms of the State.  The concept of public service is missing at local authority level, in the health service and elsewhere, but people must be encouraged to believe in what they are doing.  I hope we can get the message across through education, incentives or by other means.  It is very clear in other states that people believe and take pride in public service, no matter at what level they serve.  If people believed in what they were doing, we would not need so many investigations and rules and authorities to oversee them.  They would have a desire to do the right thing, like the gardaí who first entered the force more than 80 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I do not refer to the first gardaí for historical or rhetorical purposes, but to emphasise in the context of the reports and the revelations which prompted them that a select but determined few have tarnished the reputations of many.  I know many serving and retired gardaí who have done the State and their local communities great service, which should be acknowledged rather than lost sight of in this debate.  Those gardaí are disgusted and ashamed at the behaviour of some of their colleagues.  The actions of a few should not detract from the hard work of the many.  Unfortunately, the revelations have done great damage as did the revelations about the church and professional politics.  It is a sign of changing times and such times require reform to keep up with them.  We debate reform in the House for everyone else, but do not lead.  Our own place of work requires reform in the way we do our business.  The House does not always function as the Legislature of a proper democracy should, but if we set the pace, we can direct others to reform too.  It is a message for all of us rather than for any particular Minister.  The process must be led by those in Government whether its members are drawn from this or the other side of the House.  While I accept that it is easy to talk about these matters when one is in Opposition and that things are different when one is in Government, some day soon we will be forced to realise that we cannot expect every other organisation to reform but not ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Public confidence is vital to any profession that wishes to carry out its work, especially in the areas of law and order.  As the lengthy debate on policing in Northern Ireland has shown, communities must have complete faith in the fairness and goodwill of those appointed to look after their interests, be they law-makers or their enforcers.  The same is true of religion.  As legislators who run or want to run the country, we must do all in our power to restore public confidence in the Garda.  The Minister spoke last night about the process restoring pride in the force, which I hope it will.  However, he spoke as if the process had succeeded already, which is not the case.  This is a work in progress.  There continues to be a lack of confidence among the people who must have their faith in the Garda restored.  A great deal of the solution will be down to provision of time, effort and resources by the Garda, whose members want to do the right thing.  This provision is not always possible for various reasons.  Communities must be able to believe that gardaí will do all they can to do what is right and support them.  I fear that among some communities there is a them-and-us attitude and gardaí are spoken of as a distant group of people.  It should not be like that.  Gardaí are part of the community, which is a fact communities must recognise.  Communities need the gardaí and both parties must be encouraged to trust each other and work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Reform must not be carried out for its own sake.  Cosmetic change is meaningless and has no value.  Change must be deep and real to ensure that the old values that have worked and in which we all believe remain fresh and central as we go forward.  With all due respect to its members, the Government tries to convey the impression that it leads events, but at best it is merely reacting to them.  Even this reaction is not always as positive or proactive as the people I represent and I would like.  Last night in his opening remarks, the Minister said the subject of the debate was strong action on the part of the Government.  While there has been strong action after events, the subject of the debate has been the strong action of a few people who were not afraid to take on the system.  I accept that the Minister was not in office when the process started, but we must acknowledge that it was people acting independently who challenged the system and it is to them that we owe our thanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Our system of law and order requires complete reform and renewal, not for its own sake, but because a system which has worked historically must change and evolve if it is to continue to be effective.  What worked well before will not necessarily continue to work.  We must change while maintaining our values.  Ireland has changed significantly, its population is growing and it has vast new communities.  We have a population that is often imbued with new or strange values fostered by television and cinematic images that are neither realistic nor sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">We have major problems of unmanaged stress and lack of personal self-development and fulfilment which are driving large numbers of people to abuse alcohol and drugs.  Drug abuse causes crime as the abusers try to feed their habit and alcohol abuse causes anti-social behaviour in many towns and cities.  Those are new realities to which our system must adapt.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">We spent a great deal of time lecturing Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland on the reason their policing system was wrong, why their alternatives do not work and suggesting the type of policing structures they should put in place.  If these calls are to mean anything we should accept the Patten report in so far as it is relevant to our system.  We should seek to implement the recommendations in the Patten report in the Republic.  That would be a practical example of North-South co-operation and an important step towards a united Ireland, not necessarily of states or even justice systems but of common values, openness, transparency, accountability and natural justice.  Perhaps I seek too much from a Government which in 2002 filleted the rainbow Government's landmark Freedom of Information Act to ensure the revelations of how it bought the 2002 election and then savagely cut back afterwards could not be repeated, perhaps with an eye to the 2007 general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The abuses revealed in these reports are unacceptable but we must learn from them and react to them.  Gardaí must be open to expertise and skills, including those of management, which do not necessarily come from within their own ranks.  Those who have academic, professional or life experience, especially in management areas, should be allowed help their country and donate their time and talents by being able to apply for management positions in the Garda.  We must open the force to external talent and make it easier for people to be recruited into the Garda.  When they have been brought in, they should be accepted into the club.  They cannot be treated differently because they did not come through the same ranks.  We have expertise at all levels, something we discussed in a previous Bill where this is allowed.  It is possible the Commissioner wants to do that but I want to encourage it.  There is a great deal of talent available.  People who are trained to a high level but who could not retrain as a garda to get a job at a high level must be taken in at the position for which they have been trained.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Gardaí must be doing what they have been trained to do, that is, police.  They should not be tied up with pen pushing and democracy, and the gardaí themselves will say that.  Gardaí at local level should be able to avail of knowledge and expertise through the use of community policing, which should exist in every district.  Communities should have a greater knowledge of Garda strength in the locality and at the very least be able to suggest how such resources should be prioritised to better serve them.  We must have the local police forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Garda must be closer to the communities, not in such a way that they are compromised but that they know their communities, the people, the potential blackspots in an area and the potential offenders in a way that helps them to police better.  I fear many young gardaí leaving college believe the job involves a certain number of hours a day and then they can go home.  Policing is different.  Gardaí must be involved in the community.  They must engage in it on a constant basis.  They must talk to the local shopkeeper and pick up information.  I know community gardaí do that but all gardaí must realise that the job is more than simply putting in a few hours every day.  It must become their life and they must be in the community listening to and befriending people.  Policing is part of all that but I fear that gardaí leaving college have a different view, and that must be examined.  It is not all about degrees and other qualifications.  It is about having someone with common sense who can do the job in uniform, mixing with the people and preventing crime as well as apprehending criminals.  In the past, gardaí who lived in an area prevented crime.  It may have been petty crime but they prevented that by being observant.  That approach is missing today in many cases, mainly due to the size of populations and so on.  I do not necessarily blame lack of resources for that but we should try to get back to that because it worked in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I want clarity on two points the Minister made last night.  First, he said the force was now 20% larger than it was in 1997.  Second, he stated he had assured the Garda Commissioner that he will not lack the resources to fight crime.  That is untrue.  To take my town as an example, we have fewer gardaí now than we had in the 1980s yet our population has increased threefold.  Without quoting figures or crime incidents and so on, it does not make sense to say there are extra gardaí.  The population has grown by more than 20% and it is not a big deal, therefore, to say the force has increased by 20%.  The Garda figures do not match the population areas.  Perhaps some areas have too many gardaí.  I do not know but I know that certain areas have not got the required number of gardaí to do the job right.  It is not true to say the Commissioner has enough resources.  There are not enough gardaí trained in the use of firearms.  Detectives continue to escort money collections when an ordinary garda could do that.  That means the detective is unable to do his or her job.  Despite the peace process gardaí continue to escort vehicles carrying explosives.  I would like to say more on that but I will not because I want to make another important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Accountability is not just about Garda accountability.  It is also about this process and the way we do business.  I asked a number of questions by way of a letter in February 2005 — I will not name the case — to find out how a Garda inquiry into a murder which happened ten years previously was proceeding.  It was on behalf of a woman who wanted to find out what happened in her husband's case because there was a lack of information in that regard.  I got a response to the letter saying the matter was being looked into.  I made frequent phone calls on the matter and also put down a parliamentary question.  A letter arrived apologising for the delay and informing me that the Garda report had to be examined.  That took four or five months.  In July 2005 I was told the Garda report contained a number of irregularities and had to go back to the Garda to be checked.  It was a year later, in July 2006, before I got the information on that Garda inquiry report and it was not sufficient.  That woman is still waiting for information.  She rang me at one stage to give me a three line website address which she said contained the report on her husband's death.  That is not an accountable system.  It is not a system which helps victims get answers or one which would instill confidence in people.  I do not apportion blame to anyone in that regard.  I am saying that is the system but it is not a fair one for anybody.  I am sure the Minister and other people have better things to be doing than answering my questions but if the system worked I would not have to do that and that poor lady would not be sitting at home ten years later waiting for answers.  Perhaps the answers she wants are not available but we should be able to give her answers and bring some closure to the case.  It should not be left unanswered.  We all have a duty when it comes to reform of the Garda, its structures and the justice system.  It is time we started to talk about it in a broader sense because there is much more than just one category.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_488">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the important motion before the House on accountability, discipline and training in the Garda Síochána.  I have family and friends in the Garda Síochána and they are proud to be members of that force.  Members of the Garda Síochána should feel privileged to have such a unique job in guarding the State.  Since the foundation of the State men and women throughout the country have guarded our citizens and protected our State in very difficult times.  In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in the Border areas, times were very difficult for the Garda Síochána.  For many years people were afraid to say anything about the truth of what was happening.  Along with Deputy English I commend my constituency colleague, Deputy Howlin, and my party colleague, Senator Jim Higgins, because if it were not for them we might not be having this debate in that they raised the problems in Donegal.  That might still be happening were it not for the courage of those two people.  I commend them for the way they went about their business and never gave up in trying to bring this matter to a head.  The contribution the Garda Síochána has made to the State has been immense, as men and women performing their duties as public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I recall when I was in primary school the Garda Síochána would visit regularly.  I am trying to put in context the trust in which the Garda Síochána was held within the community.  I call on the Minister to ensure that gardaí right across the country visit primary and secondary schools on a regular basis.  By visiting schools they build up trust within the community and it is very important that this is done with pupils from a very early age, from young children to teenagers.  If the initiative is taken with young children I have no doubt that a crucial degree of trust can be built up over time.  I ask the Minister to look into that because I do not believe it is happening at present.  I speak to many school principals who tell me they never see a garda visiting the school these days.  It is vitally important this is investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Unfortunately, however, various issues have arisen in recent years to tarnish the picture.  The Donegal case in particular has changed public perception of the Garda Síochána and damaged morale within the force.  Virtually every Garda station has been affected, as I can testify from my constituency, in Enniscorthy, New Ross, Wexford and Gorey.  There are, however, genuine hard-working gardaí on the beat doing an extremely good job on a day-to-day basis and they are not thanked for the extra effort they  put in.  Many work well into off-duty hours to protect our citizens, whether finding out information or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I am disappointed, however, at the fall-off in the involvement of local gardaí at community level.  In the past the local garda might have been chairman of the GAA club and involved in local parish organisations and community initiatives.  He knew every man, woman and child in the parish, but that does not happen any more.  One cannot blame the Minister, the Commissioner, sergeants etc.  Lifestyles have changed and people want to get away from the job.  They put in their duty hours and just want to get away from work because the job has become so demanding.  A garda might be policing in Enniscorthy and living in Gorey or New Ross, or even Arklow, Waterford, Kilkenny or Carlow.  That is very disappointing.  I would like to see a return to the practice whereby when a garda is posted to a particular station, he or she lives in the immediate area.  There is no doubt that a garda will find out far more about what is going on in a community when he or she is off duty rather than when he or she is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">When one looks at what has been highlighted in the Morris, Barr, Birmingham and Nally reports, it is incumbent on the Minister, the Commissioner politicians and gardaí at all levels to preserve the confidence and respect of the Garda Síochána.  That confidence and respect has been removed from them because of bad eggs in the basket, so to speak, the bad gardaí.  It is amazing what a small number can do to destroy the rest of the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">It is similar to what has happened in the Oireachtas, with Deputies and Senators taking bribes and moneys for planning permission or whatever over many years.  The public perception, as a result, is that we are all the same.  The same condition has crept into the Garda Síochána, namely, that they are all the same, but they are not.  To go back to my original point, if people are educated from a very young age about the Garda Síochána, they will learn that the gardaí are not all the same and that there are very genuine members of the force.  We must demonstrate our appreciation of the Garda Síochána, however.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Members of the Oireachtas and the Government must ensure the force has the equipment it needs, is appreciated and has the resources to carry out its role in a professional manner.  This is something the Government has neglected to do in recent years and a major catch-up initiative is required to ensure the Garda Síochána has proper resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">A member of the force told me a few months ago that there was a new communications system in his station.  He was delighted because, as the Minister knows, the old CB system has broken down.  Everybody can break into it.  If I am talking about a drug pusher in Enniscorthy, someone in Rathnew or wherever, who may, himself or herself, be the pusher, is able to find out.  The garda in question took out a mobile phone and to use it he had to have credit in it.  I was amazed.  I see that the Minister is smiling, perhaps he is amazed as well.  I could not understand that he had to have credit in the phone to use it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_495">The Minister uses that type of phone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_496">On the one hand he welcomed this with open arms because it meant a wholly different communications system, but on the other, he felt it was better with the old CB system because at least it could be used.  How one gets credit into this communications system I do not know.  For the sake of argument, if a garda was to apprehend a drug criminal and found he had no communication, he would have to rely on his own mobile phone.  It is not acceptable that a member of the Garda Síochána has to use his or her own mobile phone to report to the Garda station, look for back-up or whatever, and pay his or her own bill in this regard at the end of the month.  If the Minister shared that with his counterparts in other countries, I doubt if they would be impressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">There is lack of confidence in the force among the public.  I sent out a crime survey in recent months to 15,000 homes in County Wexford.  There were 39 questions and I asked people to give their views on the Garda Síochána.  I do not want to be parochial in saying Wexford needs more gardaí, which of course it does, but one question I asked was whether people believed the Garda Síochána had adequate resources to do the job.  An astounding 85% said it does not.  Off the top of my head I recall that between 75% and 80% said they do not report a crime because they believe it will not be properly investigated.  I encourage people, no matter what is done to them, whether a window is broken or they are affected by anti-social behaviour, to report the matter to the local gardaí, at least.  The Garda may not be able to make a visit or to solve the problem straight away.  However, people should at least report the problem or crime because it is important that the Garda enters into the PULSE system the fact that Mrs. Murphy, Mrs. Doyle or whoever contacted it.  The PULSE system has really worked for the Garda Síochána in that gardaí are now able to enter a name into it to ascertain whether any criminal charges or reports are associated with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">I will be parochial by raising the issue of rural Garda stations.  This pertains to questions regarding local and community policing.  When I was growing up, I could state that Garda stations in three or four parishes in my locality were open.  At present, however, a station might be manned for one or two hours during the day, or every second, third or fourth day, which is unacceptable.  When a local Garda station is open, it adds to public confidence in that people are aware that someone is present.  Many rural Garda stations have been closed.  Will the Minister outline whether he believes the new Garda Reserve could play a role in manning local Garda stations?</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I come from an extremely rural and mountainous part of County Wexford in which several Garda stations have been closed.  I ask the Minister to investigate whether the Garda Reserve can play a role in ensuring that rural Garda stations are manned.  Even if this was only from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. every evening or whatever, the Garda Reserve could play a significant role in maintaining local rural stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Deputy English spoke about reform for the sake of carrying out reform.  In the aftermath of the events in County Donegal in particular, the Minister now has the perfect opportunity to carry out some real reforms.  He will not be able to do so within one or two years as the process will take several years.  However, it would mean something to people if he was to set in place a plan for the Garda Síochána spanning the next three to five years or whatever that would carry out some real reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Deputy Costello discussed the training regime in Templemore.  Although it is good to see the new additional gardaí coming on stream — I would like this to happen at a faster rate — the training of gardaí in Templemore must be examined.  Members of the force who have been employed elsewhere for two to three years previously can learn what happens within communities and can learn people skills and so on.  However, those trainees who go directly from secondary school to Templemore do not have the same skills as those who had mingled with local people in a job or whatever.  People skills are important to the Garda Síochána and a garda who leaves Templemore with people skills will be extremely successful.  Such officers will undoubtedly climb the ranks through sergeant, detective and all the way to assistant commissioner or commissioner because of the importance of people skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I omitted to mention the language barrier that has arisen in recent years with the welcome arrival of many people of European and other different nationalities.  I was pleased to learn that people of different nationalities were to be brought into the force.  Although I may have missed this development in recent months, when will it happen?  I ask the Minister to address this issue in his closing remarks.  What role will they play in the force?  In coming years, they will play an important reforming role within the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I was delighted to speak in this debate and the Minister should take on board some of my comments.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_504">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  At the outset, it is important to acknowledge the work that went into the reports that led to it and I thank those involved.  Lessons should be learned from the reports and their recommendations should be put in place as speedily as possible.  At the outset of such a debate, it is important that Members, in their capacity as legislators, should indicate their support for the work done by the Garda Síochána and should state that the Garda has done and continues to do excellent work in our communities.  To a large extent, it has served us well in the period since its foundation at the establishment of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Obviously, times have changed and in recent years in particular, undoubtedly there has been a serious reduction in respect for the Garda Síochána within the community.  There is also no doubt that some of the incidents to which the reports that led Members to this debate have referred have contributed to such a reduction in respect.  I refer to the cases in Donegal and Grangegorman, the Carthy case, the Rossiter case in my home town and the recent case in Gort.  I also refer to the over-the-top actions of the Garda in certain circumstances at Bellanaboy, including its recording of elected public representatives like me, who were going about their duly elected business at what was an absolutely peaceful protest.  All such incidents have contributed to the lack of, or decrease in respect for the Garda Síochána that has taken place over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Obviously, there are other reasons also, such as a discernible general reduction in respect for authority figures in life.  It is important to learn from what has happened and from the reports, to acknowledge the work done and to implement the reports' recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I wish to refer briefly to a number of issues that must be considered.  Apart from their normal duties as gardaí, I acknowledge the involvement of local gardaí in their communities.  In the locality from which I come, gardaí still perform excellent work in community organisations such as sporting clubs, residents' associations or whatever.  At present, however, some gardaí do not live in the communities they serve and there is rapid rotation in some cases, particularly of senior officers.  These issues must be examined and addressed.  The key to this entire area is the link between the gardaí and the community and the consequent respect and co-operation that the community and the gardaí can gel together.  Certainly, the fact that some gardaí do not now live in the communities they serve does not help that gelling between themselves and the local community, and the position in the senior ranks and the quick transfer of gardaí serving in senior ranks is also not good for morale locally and should be examined and addressed.  For example, within a period of approximately two years three different superintendents served in Clonmel in south Tipperary.  There is something not right about that.  I draw no inference about any of those superintendents, all of whom did a good job, but serving such a short period at a senior level within a force like the Garda Síochána cannot be good for the force at local level over a period of time and it should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">There is no doubt that the vast majority of gardaí do an excellent job and that the various incidents outlined in these reports have led not only to a reduction in respect for the force but also to a reduction of morale within the force.  What is vitally important is the connection between the Garda and the community and the accountability of the Garda to the community.  People feel these important aspects do not now exist or have failed in the past, and we should take this opportunity to install full transparent and independent accountability.  Many people feel the accountability that pertained in the past, through the Commissioner and the Minister, has failed.  I had hoped that the model of the Ombudsman's office in the North would be adopted and I would hope even at this late stage that another look might be taken at it because that is one of the key elements in ensuring a fully efficient and effective community-based Garda Síochána.  There must be a situation where the public feels the gardaí are absolutely accountable and that if a person makes a complaint, the matter will be examined independently and reported fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">We expect that the Garda Ombudsman Commission will be established in the new year.  While the Minister should have gone further with it, even that commission's effectiveness will be subject to the resources and funding available to it and I worry that the funding for that area in the coming year may not be adequate to make it effective and efficient and to ensure people feel that it is doing a good and transparent job.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I have raised on a number of occasions the question of the link between the community and the Garda, particularly in the area of the appointment of community gardaí.  Not enough is being done in that area to ensure that the link is built up.  In many areas there are no dedicated community gardaí, but there are certainly not enough such gardaí.  The key to turning around difficulties like antisocial behaviour and people feeling that there is no point in reporting matters to the Garda, and to turning around the decrease in respect for the Garda Síochána, is to get dedicated community gardaí working in and liaising with local communities, dealing with local tenants' organisations and dealing with young people on a daily basis.  If such a high profile highly visible community Garda operation were done properly, it would provide a highly effective and efficient Garda Síochána which would be accepted by the overwhelming majority of the community.  It would also have the advantage of nipping in the bud the difficulties that will arise down the road because, as we all know, youngsters in local areas are taking the example of their older brothers, sisters or neighbours and the crime cycle continues.  Even if one deals with the initial difficulty, then somebody else takes that person's place and the cycle continues.  I would hope that the Minister in the area of operations, which he will state is a matter for the Commissioner, would lay down guidelines and emphasise the need for highly visible, high profile community gardaí on the beat in all towns — certainly in all urban areas and large housing estates — throughout the country.  That is the key to the future of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I hope the Minister might take some of those points on board in the recommendations and decisions he will make in introducing change into the Garda Síochána.  The other point with which I will finish is the importance of the civilianisation of the Garda at all levels, not only behind the reception desk in the local Garda station but right to the highest levels of the force.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_513">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I am grateful for this opportunity to present the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Electricity Market) Bill 2006 for the consideration of the House.  When enacted, the Bill will underpin the creation of a single wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland.  It forms a key part of the Government's priority legislative programme.   It proposes to amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to provide for the establishment and operation of a single competitive wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland, hereinafter referred to as the single electricity market or SEM.  For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published, which provides a synopsis of the Bill's provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The main provisions include: an extension of the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, as required for the establishment and operation of the SEM, including the trading and settlement code for the market; establishment of an SEM committee, which will make decisions on SEM matters — the SEM committee will simultaneously be a sub-committee of both the CER and its Northern Ireland counterpart, the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation; provisions to allow modifications to licences to ensure that both existing and new licensees can participate in the SEM; and provisions for the establishment of a market operator, MO, to carry out the day-to-day trading and settlement functions for the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">To put the Bill in context, I would like to speak briefly on the background to and rationale for the establishment of the all-island single wholesale electricity market.  Creation of the new market is set in the context of long-standing co-operation between the two jurisdictions, North and South, on common energy issues.  Both administrations have a shared interest in more competitive energy markets, reduced energy costs and improved reliability of supply.  The mutual benefits to be gained by working together on this agenda are already evident and what has been achieved to date offers a model of best practice in developing co-operation between North and South.  This co-ordinated approach is also set in the context of the European Union's single market for electricity and gas and the growing regionalisation of energy markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">In November 2004, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his then Northern Ireland counterpart, Mr. Barry Gardiner MP, published the all-island energy market development framework.  The framework set out a blueprint for co-operation to create a sustainable all-island energy market and outlined the short to medium-term objectives in a number of key areas including electricity, gas and sustainable energy.  Creation of an all-island energy market will bring benefits to the island as a whole, including a larger single market with competitive energy prices, greater security and diversity of supply, a more attractive investment location and a robust, integrated infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The key short-term priority within the framework agreement is the introduction of the single wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland.  There is strong political commitment, North and South, to delivery of the market by 1 November 2007.  A key task for both Governments is to ensure that an appropriate legal framework is in place to underpin the SEM.  Implementing the market will require similar legislation to be enacted simultaneously in both jurisdictions.  A memorandum of understanding, MoU, between both Governments, setting out the broad parameters of the SEM, is also a requirement on the Northern side.  It is expected that the MoU will be signed by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his Northern counterpart, Ms Maria Eagle MP, following Government approval of the document next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The parallel legislation, which is being introduced in the North by an order in council through Westminster, needs to be enacted in both jurisdictions by April 2007 to allow sufficient time for market trials and to ensure that the new market will be operational by the committed date of 1 November 2007.  This is a tight deadline and it is important that it be met.  Any delay in introducing the market would result in loss of investor confidence and contribute to regulatory uncertainty.  There would also be negative financial implications for market participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I will briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 4 amends the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, hereafter described as the Act of 1999, by providing for the establishment of a single electricity market or SEM committee to carry out SEM regulatory functions on behalf of the CER.  A corresponding provision is being made in the Northern Ireland legislation so that the same statutory framework is in place for effective decision-making for the market North and South.  Up to seven members may be appointed to the SEM committee under ministerial warrants from among the members and staff of both regulatory authorities, the CER in Ireland and the NIAER in the North.  A member independent of both regulators will complete the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The CER and the NIAER will work together through the SEM committee to exercise their respective regulatory functions.  In compliance with section 5, the two regulatory authorities will jointly publish a statement setting out the procedures and working arrangements of the SEM committee.  Appropriate provision is made both in section 8 and in the Northern Ireland order in council, to facilitate the sharing of all relevant information to accommodate the carrying on of all-island market business.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The functions necessary to establish and operate the market are conferred on the CER by section 7.  These functions will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the making of regulations for the purpose of trading in electricity on an all-island basis, including the trading and settlement code, requiring all licensees to trade all electricity generated by them through the SEM, and the establishment of an appropriate threshold to be applied to different classes of licensees in fulfilment of this requirement.  These functions will be mirrored by the NIAER in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The day to day trading and settlement of the SEM will be carried out by a market operator, or MO, established by licence under section 11.  The MO licence will include appropriate terms and conditions relating to participation in, and the operation of, the SEM.  The market operator function will be carried out jointly by the two transmission system operators, EirGrid in the South and SONI in the North.  Other licensing provisions in sections 12 and 13 allow for modifications to licences to ensure that both existing and new licensees can participate in the SEM, together with the publication process for such modifications and breaches of licence terms and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Section 9 sets out the principal objectives of the Minister, the CER and the SEM committee in carrying out their respective functions concerning the SEM.  These include a primary objective of protection of the interests of consumers of electricity on an all-island basis, wherever appropriate, by promoting effective competition between market players participating in the SEM.  Other stated objectives include the need to ensure that all reasonable demands for electricity are met, the need to ensure co-ordinated regulation of the market, the need to have transparent pricing in the SEM, and the need to avoid unfair discrimination between consumers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The establishment of the SEM will bring a range of benefits.  It will facilitate improved competition and investment opportunities by expanding the market.  It will facilitate the exploitation of efficiencies and economies of scale in areas such as generation reserves, plant mix and fuel usage, and will introduce more transparent and equitable trading arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">An all-island electricity market will have around 2.5 million electricity customers — i.e. 1.8 million in Ireland and 0.7 million in Northern Ireland.  While this is relatively small in the EU context, it is still a considerably larger market than the two single markets operating independently, and will provide an improved base for the entry of new market participants, both generators and suppliers.  This market dynamic should also serve to increase the competitive pressure on prices while providing some economies of scale for market participants.  A single market will also lead to a reduced duplication of functions thereby realising cost savings.  The strategic benefits for the island will include increased market size, shared reserve costs, shared fuel diversity costs, a boost to investor confidence and a more competitive environment for the island as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The costs and benefits that are expected from the establishment of the SEM have been subjected to an independent analysis by consultants.  In addition, the regulatory authorities have carried out an analysis of the likely short-term price impact of the new market.  Estimating the costs and benefits of this unique project a year before it is due to go live, and while arrangements are still under development, is of necessity complex.  However, the Minister believes the assessment that has been done is both conservative and as realistic as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The overall findings of a draft cost-benefit analysis to assess the long-term economic impact of the SEM are positive and indicate an estimated net social benefit of €147 million net present value over a ten-year period.  Over 20 years, the net social benefit is estimated at €428 million net present value.  The benefit share is split roughly evenly between North and South and mostly accrues to customers with, approximately, an 80:20 split between customers and generators.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">In addition to these benefits, the study suggests that a range of other benefits will accrue from the single electricity market, SEM.  These include improved competition, reduced market power, environmental savings and enhanced effectiveness of the regulators from pooling of experience.  The initial findings of the short-term price impact analysis indicate that, at current fuel price projections, the SEM is not likely to have a significant impact on electricity prices over the opening years of operation.  Continued softening of oil and gas prices should bring about a beneficial impact on prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">In conclusion, this Bill is an important measure in the delivery of the Government's energy policy.  It is clear that the all-island approach to energy policy is one of the main binding elements of the policy proposals set out in the Green Paper.  Our long-term energy future lies not as two distinct energy markets isolated from the rest of Europe but rather as part of a regional energy market in conjunction with Britain and, possibly, other close European neighbours.  Maximising our potential market size and ensuring competitive and efficient markets in both electricity and gas are at the core of our approach and this places the all-island dimension at the heart of energy policy development for the future.  The development of the SEM is a key part of that policy in the interests of consumers and businesses on both sides of the Border.  I look forward to listening carefully to the views of Members on this important and ground breaking legislation and to their assistance in progressing the Bill into law.  Molaim an Bille don Teach.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I thank the Minister for the important briefing received from his officials and acknowledge the importance of this unique piece of North-South co-operation that will be of benefit to both parts of the island.  I accept that the all-island market will be of benefit and that economies of scale, of which both sides can avail, should ensue.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">It is important in these situations that the ground rules be recognised and consumers North and South of the Border are of the utmost importance in this matter.  I hope joint ownership of the market, for want of a better description, does not see daft decisions made such as the gas and electricity price increases we have seen in recent months despite the opposite occurring internationally.  I do not know how this can be justified and I hope no attempt is made to justify such actions in future.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, have been making noises in recent weeks suggesting this issue is still being examined, despite the circumstances mentioned existing for some months.  I hope there will be unison evident in the actions of the two sides involved to the benefit of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Another element to this issue is the benefits that will accrue from the availability of more interconnectors and there will be North-South interconnectors in addition to east-west interconnectors.  These interconnectors will be hugely beneficial to the operation of the electricity and gas markets in this country but it should be recognised that the UK already has access to the nuclear sector.  That is what they have done traditionally and it is fine, but we should not use this new situation as a means to slow the development of alternative energy sources.  In terms of economic independence and integrity regarding the grid we must be mindful that easy options in the North-South market could slow development of the alternative energy sector.  I do not doubt this would be the Minister's intention but we must be forceful about it because people tend to take easy options when the going gets rough.  The easy option would be to draw on the cheaper electricity generated by nuclear energy in the UK and Europe.  This would not be good for the country but, more importantly, we must ensure we proceed with the development of the alternative energy sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">There are many forms of alternative energy and I am aware that environmental issues arise whenever any type of energy is generated.  Some say wave generated electricity will affect the development of shores and sand bars and they are correct.  We can develop fuels for transport that will reduce emissions, as is required and as was mentioned in discussions on the previous Bill that came before the House.  Emissions will never be removed entirely but we can improve the situation dramatically and as science progresses it is hoped ways can be found to reduce the environmental impact of energy usage generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, was astounded when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, said today that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reforms had been hugely beneficial to the environment because they closed down the agriculture industry.  He was referring to the food export industry on which this country depended.  I had the fun of hearing a European Commissioner in the House telling us how lucky we were to avail of the benefits accruing from reform of the CAP.  That is total rubbish as the Minister of State knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The beef industry in this country was the backbone of the agricultural sector for many years and the day is fast approaching when the European consumer will find insufficient stocks to meet requirements.  To put things in perspective, this country has approximately 7.5 million bovine animals while in Argentina that figure is 90 million and in Brazil it is 180 million.  If Ministers for Agriculture in Europe wish to get their acts together they should, at least, be realistic about what they are doing and ask themselves how much impact they are having by dealing with the situation in this fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I wish to refer to other forms of alternative energy that are readily available and can and should be developed in this country.  There are sewage treatment plants all over the country and many of them are spilling into rivers as we speak.  They often stink to high heaven with methane gas pouring into the atmosphere, for ten years in some cases.  I do not understand why something is not done about this.  I was doing my rounds in August, as we all do, and got out of my car in a village where I was overpowered by the level of methane gas.  When I inquired I was informed the local sewerage scheme had broken down and the whole community, for a ten mile radius, was inhaling what is a form of energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">If we are to make this electricity market work we must examine the alternatives and develop them to the best of our ability without taking the easy option to escape reality and make excuses when things do not happen.  This is a good Bill which will have tremendous benefits, specifically in the area of North-South co-operation.  Nevertheless, the Fine Gael Party intends to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Enlarging the energy market and delivering economies of scale do not offer complete solutions because both parts of the island will need to significantly develop the energy sector in response to population and economic growth.  I hope the peace process will continue on track and deliver major economic benefits to the country.  Many citizens do not realise the contribution the peace process will make to economic development.  However, economic growth will also increase demand for energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Economies of scale must be borne in mind.  If Ireland had the same population density as the Netherlands, our population would be approximately 48 million.  With such a population level, our energy requirements would be massive.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Research and development must continue if we are to expand the energy market and meet the energy requirements of our citizens.  The United Kingdom and many more of our European partners have defined their future energy strategies.  Some countries have achieved significant expansion in the alternative energy sector.  The mix of energy our partners will use to generate electricity includes conventional fossil fuels, gas, wind and nuclear power.  Approximately 80% of France's electricity supply is generated by nuclear power plants.  It is important to note that the approach taken on the European mainland may not work as well here.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">It is good that the electricity grid will be jointly operated by the Northern and Southern authorities.  We must sing from the same hymn sheet and ensure prices are not arbitrarily increased in either jurisdiction.  Prices must increase or decrease as the market demands, having due regard to the needs of industrial and domestic consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Security of supply and the integrity of the grid are essential.  I do not accept that other countries are better equipped than we are to address this issue.  Irish energy producers have coped with supply problems in the past when they received the necessary support.  Grid operators on the Continent have failed to maintain electricity supply at least twice in the past 18 months.  Only a few weeks ago, large parts of Germany, Italy, Spain and other mainland European countries experienced a major power outage, despite having well-run grids and excellent information available to grid controllers and regulators.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">While regulators are necessary in an expanding electricity market, the purpose of regulation is to give the consumer the benefit of competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">The merger of the regulators could result in job losses.  Government policy in both parts of the island must direct future developments.  We should not allow regulators to dictate policy.  I do not suggest the Minister of State would permit such an eventuality but Ministers have been known to bob, weave, duck and disclaim responsibility in matters for which they should be responsible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_553">The objective of my party in doing so was to benefit and protect the interests of domestic and industrial energy consumers.  This has not always been the case.  I heard people moan on radio this morning about the reasons the price of electricity should be reduced.  As I indicated earlier, it is better late than never.  On what basis were prices increased two months ago given that prices were falling all over the world at the time?  One need not have been a nuclear physicist to have worked out that prices were falling on the markets.  On the day the increase in the price of gas was announced the product was free on the London market.  Despite our sophistication, we have not yet defied gravity.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The consumer should benefit from changes in the energy marketplace.  This will require significant investment both in research and development of the alternative energy sector and in security of the grid.  Interconnectors should not be developed to the point that they discourage research and development in alternative energies.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Fine Gael Party policy is to invest €500 million on research and development in its first four years in Government.  I watched Ministers raise their eyebrows and describe this proposal as outrageous, yet in recent years the Government has received dividends from the ESB amounting to €350 million and benefited from a further €360 million in extra VAT arising from hyped up prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I hope someone will not decide in 12 or 18 months that higher energy costs are necessary.  Any such move would have an immediate negative knock-on impact on the economy.  More than 30,000 jobs are being relocated to other jurisdictions because energy and other costs have increased to the extent that it is no longer possible for the companies in question to remain here.  This trend affects all constituencies.  County Donegal, for example, is experiencing serious job displacement because the economy is becoming less and less competitive.  This is an unsustainable position.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">We must invest heavily in developing alternative energies, rather than waiting for the interconnector to open in order that we can use energy resources generated elsewhere.  While we can also export via the interconnector, it is not certain we will do so.  The use of the interconnector will create dependence on the European grid, which has failed twice in the past 18 months.  It is only when the lights go out that we realise how important it is to have access to a permanent supply of energy.  The Ministers, North and South, must accept responsibility for directing the regulators.  When we exchange places in the House, I will happily put in place the measures required.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_563">Policy direction must remain the political responsibility of Ministers, who are responsible to their legislatures; the wisdom of any deviation from that must be questioned.  It might be good to escape the responsibility, something Ministers like to do, but once the power to direct is removed from the Minister's hands, it goes to whomsoever's guess is best.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I mentioned our future energy needs increasing.  I hope the regulators will have due regard for this and will not only report to Ministers on time but will indicate the growth rates necessary in the industry as demand increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Electricity will become hugely important for road and rail travel and the degree to which we rely on it will change.  The Japanese have invented a motor car with all the attributes necessary for long journeys — torque and acceleration.  It is like what happened with mobile phones, which used to have massive batteries.  These cars can accelerate from zero to 100 kilometres per hour in four or five seconds, equivalent to a Maserati.  They have the same brake horsepower as the modern saloon car, the acid test for feasibility.  Within the next four years, we will see electric cars readily available and the electricity market must develop accordingly.  If a person parks his car, there should be a socket to plug it in while he is about his business.  Filling stations will change completely because it is unlikely that someone will leave his car for three hours while it charges.  It is a question of recharging the batteries when the car is not being used, something that depends on where it is parked.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Electricity usage does not automatically lead to emissions, which are caused by the mode of generation and how the generated energy is used.  Wind generation is a beneficial addition to the market that must be continued.  We all know there will be resistance to wind turbine developments in certain areas.  They must be located sensitively.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The British now emphasise microgeneration.  This can affect the security and integrity of the grid depending on the degree to which those who opt for microgeneration rely on a supply from the grid if they become becalmed.  It has been suggested that becalming will not take place but I do not accept that.  When traders depended on sail power, the trade winds were vital and many travellers could be becalmed for days or weeks because there was no wind.  It is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">It has been suggested that entire swathes of the countryside could not be affected at the same time but that is not how it works.  It might not happen at the same instant but it could happen within a single hour, in which case there will be a need to draw on the grid.  The degree to which the grid can hold up in such circumstances depends on imponderables.  We must ensure the various components contributing to the grid are such that in the event of power shortages, power from other sources will be sufficient.  Otherwise, there could be no electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">There are those who say that we survived before electricity, but we have become accustomed to it.  There are also those who object to the alternatives we may have to use in the future.  No system is without its problems but if we are sensitive about where we locate our generation points and about environmental needs, there will not be many problems.  If, however, we wake up one morning and the lights do not come on and there is no power or heat, it will concentrate minds.  A whole new appreciation of what we are about will arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I hope the Bill is as beneficial as intended.  I wish every good fortune to those, North and South, who are committed to this Bill.  It is a good idea that improves and expands the market.  It may not resolve the market's problems entirely — nothing will because it will continue to expand — but the Bill's benefits should accrue for consumers.  They are the people for whom such legislation is intended.  It is not for regulators to instruct us and tell us we are lucky to be able to live in a certain way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_571">I refer to a press release I received from the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey who is in Hanoi where he met Dr. Do Trung Ta.  The Vietnamese Government is spending $4 billion on an ICT system.  This is approximately €3.7 billion more than what the Irish Government is spending over the next eight or ten years.  It is hoped the Minister will come back from Hanoi a changed man when we will be tabling some amendments to the current Bill.  If I knew he was going to Hanoi I might have been able to send on a message from my own Vietnamese constituents who are so hard working and diligent.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I welcome the introduction of the single electricity market Bill as a truly historic step linking the two very small and isolated electricity markets on this island.  The Bill marks a significant development in energy legislation and it has profound implications for the long-term energy system.  I have long been an advocate of practical patriotism, of ensuring that concrete measures are in place to contribute to the increased co-operation and harmonisation on both parts of the island for the economic benefit of all the people of the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I have some general concerns at the outset about the mechanisms that have been used on the British side to pass the legislation.  It must go through an Order in Council to give effect to the legislation in Northern Ireland.  There is a hiatus in the existence of the Northern Ireland Assembly but it is to be hoped that the Assembly Members and the democratic process in Northern Ireland is not being excluded from this important debate.  People in the North are very aware of this debate.  I heard Ian Paisley junior talking about the energy supply board.  He had the title slightly wrong but it is clear he knows that the Electricity Supply Board will henceforth be playing a significant role in the electricity market in both parts of this island.  It is to be hoped that the use of this Order in Council does mean an attempt to bypass democratically elected Members of both Dáil Éireann and the Northern Ireland Assembly in favour of control by regulators or technocrats.  This matter has formed the basis of many of the amendments tabled by Deputy Durkan and me during the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">This Bill and its proposals have been under discussion since 1999 when the Minister's predecessor, Mary O'Rourke, set off on our side of the Border on the long path that has finally led to this historic day.  The Bill deals with the technical issues of establishing the single electricity wholesale market, the provision for information between the various parties to the single electricity market in section 8 and the provision of a licensing framework for the establishment of the single electricity market operator in sections 11 to 13, inclusive.  The operation of those new sections will fundamentally alter the electricity market in both parts of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">A number of issues are referred to in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and in the report entitled, The Development Framework for the All-Island Market, which was published in November 2004 by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in conjunction with DETI, the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  These include the need for a single transmission system operator, the harmonisation of tariffs, common grid codes, generation adequacy reports, common generation adequacy reports, metering policy — which the House discussed last week — the harmonisation of carbon trading policies and renewable and energy efficiency policies and a host of other issues which are not dealt with in this modest Bill.  The ongoing delays and haphazard manner which has characterised the tabling of the single electricity market Bill, indicate the overall apathy with which the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition has dealt with energy matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">IBEC used a phrase of mine when referring to energy.  It stated that the current, outgoing Government is sleepwalking on energy policy.  It is to be hoped it will sleep walk its way out of office and Deputies on this side of the House will be given a chance in four or five months time to shape energy policy from the Government benches.  I welcome the Bill but it is regrettable that the date for the single electricity market to go live has been postponed for nearly six months, from the original target date of July 2007 until November 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the electricity sector in Ireland criticised the barriers in place for the achievement of the 2010 renewables targets and argued that "if there is any delay in the delivery of the single electricity market target opening date of July 2007, overall industry and investor confidence may be negatively impacted".  This is stated on page 42 of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  The Government has failed to meet the target date and it has been lethargic on a whole range of energy matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I refer to the Minister's comprehensive opening contribution in which he refers to the cost-benefit analysis.  I compliment the departmental officials who were very helpful to the Opposition regarding the development of the legislation.  I note that the cost-benefit analysis promises an estimated net social benefit of €147 million, net present value, discounted over a ten year period.  Over a 20 year period the net social benefit is estimated at €428 million.  The split is supposed to be 80:20 between customers and generators.  The Minister, his officials and the regulators have a key responsibility to ensure this happens.  This House should be bringing in a much bigger, all-island electricity market which would mean lower prices to consumers.  Both Members and the Ceann Comhairle have received a torrent of e-mails from small and medium-sized businesses which do not know how they will be able to meet that 20% tariff rise if it happens on 1 January as they are also suffering from the rise in gas prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">This Bill should be regarded as a means of bringing about lower prices and if it does not, then the work of the House is misplaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Minister should inform the House the reason for another six months delay in the introduction of the single electricity market.  Reports in the media suggested there were problems with the computer system and the detailed market modelling could not be done. <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>reported that there were difficulties in obtaining work permits for the necessary specialist staff.  I ask the Minister to inform the House whether this has happened elsewhere and whether other electricity markets have been linked together and integrated.  There are not too many examples of where this has been done.  In that regard I know it is a difficult and historic path on which we are embarking.  We were informed there were technical problems but the Minister has never briefed the Opposition on the reasons for the six month delay nor has he addressed claims that it was because of delays by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in bringing forward the necessary legislation which is finally before the House today.  He will need to indicate whether any other legislation is planned and whether this is just the first of a series of Bills.  This Bill is an amendment to the 1999 Act which set up CER and which must be read in conjunction with the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I ask the Minister to address the question of the initial delay and the further delay to November 2007.  Our officials have endeavoured to quantify in cost-benefit terms the exact advantages to this country and to the people of all the island of the implementation of the single electricity market.  The two markets are so small, it is understandable there have been many problems.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_583">As I advised the House on several occasions this year, most recently on 26 October last, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional or county level are day to day functions of the State tourism agencies.  There has been a major reform of Irish tourism structures in recent years with the setting up of Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland.  Reform of the function, role and operational aspects of sub-national structures, as recommended by the tourism policy review group in its report "New Horizons for Irish Tourism — An Agenda for Action", was the final phase of that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">In response to the recommendation in the "New Horizons" report, Fáilte Ireland commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to review regional tourism structures.  That report recommended the establishment of regional tourism development boards to ensure a greater focus on the individual needs of each region at a national level, and the subsuming of former regional tourism authority management and staff into Fáilte Ireland.  The bodies known as county tourism committees were a substructure of the regional tourism authorities, RTAs.  To facilitate the new regional structures and the establishment of the five new regional tourism development boards, the former regional tourism authorities passed the necessary resolutions earlier this year and the boards of directors resigned.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">Following the dissolution of the RTAs, I gave my consent to the establishment by Fáilte Ireland of five regional tourism development boards — in the south-east, the south-west, the west, the midlands-east and the northwest regions — and the delegation of certain functions to each of the boards.  The functions so delegated are: directing the formulation and regular review of a comprehensive tourism development strategy for its region, to cover all key aspects of tourism development including the product, enterprise support, training, marketing, infrastructure and environmental management needs of tourism in that region; drafting multi-annual work plans for its region to support the implementation of the region's development strategy for tourism; submitting multi-annual plans to Fáilte Ireland for funding and other resources and securing funding, as appropriate, from within the region; overseeing the implementation of the region's approved work plans and approving corrective action as appropriate; reporting on outcomes achieved from implementing the region's tourism development strategy and issues arising from its implementation; performing the role of advocate for tourism development in its region in accordance with national and regional policies and procedures; and working closely with other bodies in the region to support the development of tourism in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">I appreciate that a significant amount of energy and activity exists at county level with many tourism enterprises and the local authorities often identifying, in the first instance, with the county structure.   However, I understand the experience with regard to the former county tourism committees was mixed and inconsistent.  I also understand that they performed with varying degrees of effectiveness.  In this regard, I expect that the regional strategies to be drawn up by the regional tourism development boards will seek to harness and build on the county dynamic within the overall regional framework.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_249">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_587">Can the Minister clarify that he is no longer in favour of having county tourism committees?  That seems to be the thrust of his reply, especially the conclusion of that reply.  There is much uncertainty as regards the future of county tourism committees.  Some of these operated very effectively and our county had an effective committee.  Last year it put in place a map of the county, which the Minister will no doubt launch in the new year.  It was a representative group, and I am sure the Minister will agree that many of the decisions that affect tourism and are put in place locally are made by local authorities.  These include decisions such as signposting, roads, the provision of sanitation measures and, most importantly, the control of pollution and litter.  If the Minister is dismissing the role of local authorities and the local tourism committees, it will weaken our overall product and structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">In view of the importance of county tourism authorities, will the Minister appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers, or another consultancy, to examine the future and structures of local tourism committees in the same way in which it examined the RTAs?  This could determine how the local committees could integrate with the regional tourism development authorities.  Decisions will be made by the regional tourism development authorities that can be put in place at national levels, but important decisions will also have to be put in place at local level.  I can see a role for the local tourism committees putting in place decisions made by the regional authority.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_589">The articles of association of the former regional tourism authorities govern the formation of the county tourism committees.  Now that the RTAs no longer exist, the former county tourism committees have also lapsed.  PricewaterhouseCoopers examined the county committees and determined that the State structures to support tourism had significantly disaggregated over time and that a large number of entities were involved.  There was too much duplication.  The effectiveness of the county tourism committees is quite debatable.  Some of them met infrequently, many of them were barely staffed and it is clear they were under-resourced and had limited access to finance.  Local authorities are adequately represented on the new regional development boards.  Too much duplication in tourism is a mistake.  It leads to inefficiency and ineffectiveness.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_251">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_590">The Minister is quite clearly announcing the winding up of the county tourism committees.  The Minister once served on a local authority.  Local authorities have an important role to play in tourism not only in developmental work but in setting charges and rates.  Unless there is a strong voice for tourism in a county like Kerry, tourism interests will not be represented.  A large percentage of Kerry's revenue comes from tourism enterprises, and these will no longer be represented in decision-making in our county.  I do not know who is advising the Minister on this matter, but I appeal to him to review his approach towards county tourism committees.  I ask him to further review their effectiveness.  I agree that they must be given a structure and a <i>raison d’être</i>.  If I were to get an opportunity in this area I would make them part of my priority in the entire tourism network.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">Western regions are currently losing out to eastern regions in terms of tourism.  If we want to do something about this, the dynamic could come from the county pride and structure.  These structures already exist and they influence every part of local authority areas.  The most important structure in the country is the local authorities.  The Minister is dismissing it as regards tourism development and that is unfortunate.</p>

            <p eId="para_592">I am not announcing the death of the country tourism committees, I am merely writing the obituary.  There clearly was too much duplication, overlap and overcrowding in tourism structures in the State.  We need to target the resources we have in a measured and focused way.  We cannot do that if there is too much disaggregation in the process.  I do not believe it is a great idea.</p>

            <p eId="para_594">Local authorities still have a role in the sense they are involved in the regional tourism development authorities and they have a substantial role to play through their elected members and county managers in that respect.  It is clear we have reformed the structures of the tourism industry through Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and the new Regional Tourism Development Authorities.  I am confident this is the way forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_596">The Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) and Summary Public Capital Programme for 2007, which were published on 16 November last, make a provision of €686.836 million for my Department with a further €11.765 million provision for the National Gallery of Ireland, representing an increase of 17.6% over the 2006 allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">However, in the initial analysis of the figures, it is important to view them in the context of the exceptional growth in financial allocations for these areas in recent years.  The arts, sport and tourism sectors have received unprecedented tangible support from Government in terms of significantly increased financial allocations.  Since 2003, current funding has been increased by a whopping 43.4%, or €121 million.  However, capital funding has increased by a massive 147.5% or €178 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Turning to 2007, the capital allocation for my Department and the National Gallery is almost €299 million, making provision for vital infrastructural developments across all sectors of my Department's remit and demonstrating strong and continued Government support for the development of local, regional and national facilities for the enjoyment of arts and sports activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The total current allocation for my Department for 2007 is almost €400 million, an increase of over 8% on 2006.  In addition to providing for the day-to-day running costs of my Department and the various agencies and bodies under its aegis, it will also enable the roll-out and further development of the many important initiatives and support programmes available through both the Department and the agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">In regard to the arts, culture and film sectors, the 2007 Estimates provide for a combined allocation of over €216.56 million for my Department and the National Gallery of Ireland, an increase of 8.65% over 2006.  Of particular note is the 11% increase in Arts Council funding, bringing the council's total budget for 2007 to €80 million, confirmation of the high regard in which arts and culture are held by the Government.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased by 53% over the last three years.  I have also made a provision of €4.5 million to Culture Ireland, a 50% increase in the funding available this year, recognising that quality cultural exports highlight Ireland internationally as a culturally strong visitor and investment destination.  Funding for the Irish Film Board will increase by 15%, enabling the board to continue with its essential role of developing and supporting the Irish film sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">There are increased expenditure provisions for our national cultural institutions while support for the National Gallery of Ireland will increase by 25% to over €11.5 million.  I am particularly pleased to make available an allocation of €250,000 towards the operating costs of the new National Children's Museum.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">This Government has spent over €900 million on the promotion of sport and sporting infrastructure since 1997, an unprecedented level of investment.  This is clear and unambiguous evidence of the importance the Government attaches to having in place modern well-equipped and well-managed sporting facilities supported by a wide range of programmes, all of which have a real benefit in our communities.  For 2007, I am pleased to have been able to again secure a significantly increased allocation for the sports sector, with a total provision of over €316 million, representing an increase of 30% over 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">Within this sports allocation, the budget for the Irish Sports Council will increase by 20% from just under €41 million this year to over €49 million in 2007.  This will allow for the funding for the Irish Institute of Sport which was launched in July 2006 to deliver optimal support for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and sports, as well as providing support for the new horse sport governing body, Horse Sport Ireland.  The increased allocation will also provide for the continued extension of the network of local sports partnerships and increases in funding for programmes specifically targeted at women.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">The 2007 Estimates allocations for my Department also provide for unprecedented levels of capital investment in our sporting infrastructure, with €76 million being made available towards the costs of the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium and a further €30 million for the development of the first phase of the Sports Campus at Abbotstown.  The capital allocation to meet the cost of grants for local and regional sports facilities, including swimming pools, will be almost €88 million.  This will be used to meet payments in respect of commitments already made as well as those to be made in 2007 under the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes.  As a point of clarification, I should point out that while the total subhead provision for the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes is €67 million, it is the intention that the full capital carryover of €20.842 million will be applied to these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">In regard to the tourism sector, I have been able to secure an allocation of €154 million, a 9% increase on the 2006 budget, resulting in the largest ever Exchequer budget for tourism.  This is clear evidence of this Government's strong commitment to the Irish tourism industry and enables my Department to provide effective support for the sector as it responds to the challenges outlined in the New Horizons tourism strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">Within the overall tourism budget, the increase of 12.5% in the tourism marketing fund to €45 million builds on the increased funding provided in earlier years and will enable both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to ratchet up their marketing activities in 2007, with a particular emphasis on an enhanced regional focus and new marketing strategies for North America and new and developing markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">The new Regional Tourism Development Boards will also benefit from additional funding being provided to Fáilte Ireland, which is being allocated almost €80 million in 2007.  These boards, which were established over the past few months, will bring a new dynamic to regional tourism, in particular in the planning, product development and training areas.  There are also plans to launch a new product development strategy and the focus of the strategy is both to further enhance tourism in developed areas and to take special initiatives in areas of the country which are less developed in a tourism sense.  This new strategy is expected to form part of the tourism programme in the new national development plan.  An allocation of €8.75 million is being provided for tourism product development in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">The numbers outlined above speak for themselves.  The continued investment provided for in the 2007 Estimates are a clear demonstration of the continued support which this Government has shown, and continues to show, for the arts, sport and tourism sectors.</p>

            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_610">I welcome the Minister's detailed response.  The 17.5% rise in the Estimate for the Department augers well for the various headings.  The reason I tabled this question was that Swim Ireland attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As we all know, this organisation has come through difficult times and the Minister has been in office for much of that time.  Unfortunately, corporate Ireland does not recognise the work of this organisation as evidenced by the serious lack of sponsorship.  However, the organisation has survived due to Government funding which was recognised at the committee meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">The organisation has reached a point where it wants to move on.  It has put in place well documented guidelines which must be adhered to by those involved in the sport, especially coaches.  However, further departmental funding is required.  Does the Minister envisage providing funding for Swim Ireland which will help it to move on?  It is the one sport which has something extra in that in addition to providing entertainment, recreation and competition, it is a life saver.  In the 1,400 swimming clubs throughout the country, there are a number of life savers in each club.  Will the Minister give us an undertaking that any application made by Swim Ireland will be dealt with in a positive manner?  Having listened to the wonderful presentation made at the committee, the group needs help.  I hope the Government will provide help and that as result we will see corporate Ireland provide further assistance through a great deal more sponsorship than at present.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_612">The Government supports swimming which is clear from the construction of the National Aquatic Centre and the Olympic size pool at the University of Limerick.  Under the swimming pools programme, 23 swimming pools around the country have been completed since 2000.  Some 15 more are under construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">In regard to Swim Ireland and its allocation, Deputy Wall will be aware that its funding comes from the Sports Council as this is a revenue matter.  The Sports Council's funding has been increased significantly from €40.9 million last year to €49.025 million this year.  That represents an increase of approximately 20% over last year which is particularly significant.  It is open to Swim Ireland, as it is to every other national governing body, to make an application to the Sports Council for funding.  Clearly, Swim Ireland believes it requires a greater degree of funding than before and it is open to it to make its application in the context which Deputy Wall outlined.  Hopefully, the Sports Council will look at that matter favourably.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_614">I recognise the procedure whereby applications are made to the Sports Council.  However, I ask the Minister to look positively on Swim Ireland, an organisation which has been checked out in the various reports etc., carried out.  If the Minister looks positively on Swim Ireland, it will result in corporate Ireland looking more favourably on it than at present.  Many youngsters are involved in swimming and there are swimming pools everywhere, which is welcome.  However, there is a need for the Minister to state that Swim Ireland is a well organised organisation which cares for its members.  It is not all about getting money from the Sports Council.  The positivity provided to the general public, businesses and the corporate structure is the real making of Swim Ireland.  I was more than impressed by the Swim Ireland officials the day they appeared before the joint committee.  I hope the Minister is in a position to say he believes Swim Ireland is ready to move forward.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_615">Swim Ireland has made a genuine effort to try and resolve its difficulties.  However, I point out to Deputy Wall that the only recommendation in the 1998 Murphy report of direct relevance to my Department concerns the issue of funding.  This is the reason I dealt with that issue in my reply.  The report advocated that additional funding be allocated through the Irish Sports Council for the development of sport and that this funding should be given to Swim Ireland for necessary reorganisation and training.  Since 1999, Swim Ireland has received over €3.6 million in funding from the Irish Sports Council.  The grants received last year amounted to €804,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">A number of other recommendations in the report related to the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science.  These recommendations were brought to the attention of the relevant Departments for their information.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">In reply to the point made by Deputy Wall, the Irish Sports Council is satisfied that Swim Ireland has been restructured and refocused in accordance with the recommendations of the Murphy report.  Since the publication of the report in 1998, further changes have taken place with regard to best practice and in legislation on child welfare through the Department of Health and Children.  There have also been reviews and updates of the Irish Sports Council's code of ethics on good practice for children's sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">The Irish Sports Council has confirmed to me that Swim Ireland is in compliance with the provisions of the council's code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland.  I hope this statement is of assistance not just to Deputy Wall, but through him to Swim Ireland.</p>

        <b>Mr. Healy</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
         his intentions for the National Aquatic Centre in view of the recent happenings in the Supreme Court and in view of allegations that the building is deteriorating rapidly. 
        [40917/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_260" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_620">I wish to express my satisfaction that the National Aquatic Centre will be restored to Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, following an order by consent made by the Supreme Court on 14 November.  Following the persistent failure of Dublin Waterworld Limited to comply with obligations under its lease, I directed CSID to seek forfeiture of the lease in the High Court.  The High Court found there had been "wilful breaches" of the lease by Dublin Waterworld Limited.  A judgment in favour of CSID, delivered by the High Court earlier this year, was appealed by Dublin Waterworld Limited to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court ordered that possession be handed over on 30 November, that pending such hand-over the defendant will abide by the terms of the undertaking to the Supreme Court dated 12 May — these were the terms of the stay on the order for possession, that the sum on joint deposit as security for costs in this case is released with interest immediately to McCann FitzGerald, and that the High Court order as to costs be vacated and there be no further order as to costs in the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">This means that CSID regains possession of the centre from midnight tonight.  The immediate handover of the National Aquatic Centre is a significantly more advantageous position than would have been the case had the appeal proceeded.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">Following the initiation of the High Court proceedings, CSID put in place a contingency plan to take over the operation of the National Aquatic Centre in anticipation of regaining possession.  The facility will now be managed by CSID (Operations) Limited, a subsidiary of CSID.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the role of the staff at the centre.  They have been through a difficult and uncertain time and I assure them that CSID will fully comply with any and all legal obligations towards the staff.  I understand that CSID met with the staff on Tuesday last and briefed them on the plans for the future.  It is the intention that there should be a seamless transition to the new operating company and that the business of the centre continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">I wish to address the Deputy's concerns regarding the condition of the building.  CSID is confident the facility is in good condition, but it will carry out a full health check on the total facility, starting tomorrow, with a view to dispelling any concerns once and for all.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">The facilities at the centre will be maintained and managed to the highest quality so the residents of Blanchardstown and the wider community can enjoy one of our flagship facilities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Mr. Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_625">I join the Minister in support of the staff at the centre.  Is the Minister aware of allegations that the building has deteriorated considerably?  What works need to be carried out to bring the centre up to a good standard, how much will they cost and who will be responsible for the costs of any works necessary?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_626">As is well known, there was storm damage in January 2005 because of severe weather conditions in west Dublin.  The roof was damaged as were various fittings around the complex.  Repair works were completed on 20 May 2005 and the centre was reopened to the public on that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">Kavanagh, Mansfield &amp; Partners has certified that the programme of works was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the design and it secured certification from the designers, contractors and subcontractors with regard to the various elements of the work.  The capital expenditure concerned has been covered between the insurers and the main contractor and no Exchequer expenditure was involved.  The repair work cost just over €1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">With regard to reports of leaks, during 2005 reports of leaks were carried through various media organs and as a result an inspection team conducted a technical examination of the entire centre.  Experts in the field were called in and the team found there was no evidence of any structural defects or of any water leaking into the plant room, despite what was alleged in the media.  While some leakage from pipe joints and valves was identified, in the view of the inspectors, these arose for reasons of operational and maintenance issues and were not structural.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">In addition, a test was carried out and confirmed there were no leaks from the swimming pools.  URS structural engineers confirmed that the concrete works were designed and constructed to meet the British Standard 8007 and confirmed that any cracks that existed did not leak, were not of a structural nature and were entirely normal for a building of this type.  The inspection carried out confirmed the allegations were unfounded and may have been connected with the ongoing court case.  The report to the effect that the leaks did not exist got little coverage in the media.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">There was also a snag list.  In common with all new buildings, there is a process for dealing with snags that arise in the building.  The attitude of Dublin Waterworld Limited in not facilitating access to the centre while the dispute on the lease was in progress resulted in the final snag list not being satisfactorily resolved.  That process was also interrupted by the damage and the repair work to the roof.  Approximately €320,000 has been retained and it will not be paid until the snag list is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">The resolution of all matters is frequently a long-drawn out process in projects of this magnitude.  However, the work will now resume.  It is hoped the remaining issues will be resolved without delay.  I am delighted this saga will come to a close at midnight tonight and that the State, through a subsidiary, will operate the centre for the foreseeable future.  That is as I wish it to be.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">This has been a long and sorry saga and it has lessons for everyone involved.  However, what is certain is that this project came in on time and within budget.  It has had its difficulties, but the National Aquatic Centre which hosted the Special Olympics and the European short course championships has been praised as one of the finest facilities of its kind throughout the world.  I hope that in future we will not have the difficulties we have had in the past and that the people can be proud of this flagship project.</p>

        <b>Mr. Deenihan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
         his views on whether funding for the Arts Council in Estimates 2007 falls far short of the demand for grant aid for bursaries, awards, projects and schemes in 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [41024/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_263" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_634">Since becoming Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2002, I have consistently and effectively made the case, in the context of annual Estimates discussions, for increased funding for the arts, and the results are clearly in evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">Since 2002 funding for the Arts Council has increased by over 67% from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007.  This clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to the arts and has allowed the Arts Council to support a record number of artists and arts organisations around the country.  These are significant amounts of money in any context and have transformed and increased access to the arts in recent years, and provide an excellent platform for even further developments in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">However, the Arts Council is an independent body under the Arts Act 2003 and is wholly independent in its funding decisions.  I have, therefore, no involvement in the allocation of grants to specific projects under the Arts Council's schemes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_264">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_637">I remind the Minister that the increase of 11% he provided to the Arts Council this year was more or less committed already.  There is a commitment to the Abbey Theatre, a €2 million commitment to touring and a commitment to the traditional arts.  In reality, the Arts Council has received a very small increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">Last year the Arts Council received approximately 2,065 applications from individuals, festivals, groups and so on but it could only fund 500 of these.  Of the individual artists who applied for funding, only one in three received funding, and of the festivals, one in two received funding.  Many people will be disappointed next year.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a 30% increase in funding might result in a 100% increase in output.  Many artists are frustrated because they do not have the funding to develop their work fully.  We are failing to capitalise on much latent undeveloped talent due to the lack of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Given the Arts Council will have a demand for approximately €120 million next year but will receive €70 million or less, the result will be frustration for many people.  The Minister should consider ways of providing additional funding.  I realise the Supplementary Estimate will be brought forward next week.  If the Minister could provide funding from any source for the Arts Council for next year, it would assist it to fulfil its meaningful role.  Before the Minister announced the Estimate, the chairman and chief executive of the council expressed concern about the level of funding it is receiving for next year.  Funding <i>per capita</i> here is well below that in other countries and Northern Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_265" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_640">On my watch, the budget for the Arts Council has increased by 67% which, by any standard, is a substantial increase over a four year period.  This has been recognised and acknowledged by those involved in the arts throughout the country.  As with all budgets and Estimates, everybody will not get everything they want.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">International comparisons are far less simple than originally appears to be the case.  Approaches to what is classified as "arts" can differ quite dramatically.  It must also be noted that jurisdictions with very high spending across the board also tend to have very high tax rates, which we do not have.  The arts must compete for funding with all other sectors, which it has done successfully.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Since I became Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, there has been a tradition of seeking to invest savings in the arts where possible.  For example, as part of the first phase of its three year strategy the Arts Council sought an allocation of €79.3 million from me in 2006.  With the savings I have allocated to the Arts Council, which have been greatly welcomed, the amount I allocated to the Arts Council during 2006 was greater than the amount it sought.  The council's funding for 2006 now stands at €79.81 million, which exceeds the amount sought and demonstrates the Government's commitment to the arts sector in no uncertain terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">This year, the Arts Council sought €80 million and was given that amount.</p>

            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_644">It was more than that.  It sought €100 million.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_645">If, in the course of 2007, further funding becomes available to assist the arts community, the Arts Council and arts organisations, the Deputy can be assured I will do all I can to assist.  That has been my record and that of Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_646">Before the Minister gets totally carried away, I point out that he was the first Minister in recent times to reduce funding for the Arts Council, when he reduced it by €5 million in 2002.  The arts community is still reeling from that reduction.  Cuts were made that led to the loss of very good personnel, the closure of some venues and the stopping of touring.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">Will the Minister consider the touring budget in particular and provide further funding?  A beginning was made this year with €2 million committed from this fund over a three year period for various forms of arts.  For example, the Druid Theatre Company is touring with John B. Keane's "Year of the Hiker" this year.  The play was staged in Tralee recently, where it was full to capacity every night.  It is now in Portlaoise and will visit Letterkenny, where centres were established with taxpayers' money over the years.  However, since funding was withdrawn in 2002, some centres are not visited by touring groups.  I ask the Minister to increase this aspect of funding, particularly in view of cultural inclusion.  A report to be published shortly will outline that one of the main barriers to cultural inclusion in this country is that professional touring groups cannot visit all parts of the country.</p>

Those adjustments have proven to be the correct course of action.  Time has proven the Government was right.  While there were slight cutbacks in terms of the budget for the Arts Council at that time, these have been more than made up for.  Again, we have seen a substantial increase in Arts Council funding this year.</p>

        <b>Mr. Wall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
         if he will expand on his recent comments that a national audit of sporting facilities will be undertaken to provide accurate information on the range, suitability and type of facilities available here ahead of the 2012 London Olympics; when he expects this audit to commence; the person who will oversee the audit; the remit of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_276" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_656">The nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one of the audit will establish a record of national and regional sports facilities and is being carried out within my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">The work currently being undertaken is a data gathering exercise in conjunction with the main sporting bodies and local authorities to identify the facilities for inclusion in this phase.  My Department has identified a list of in excess of 100 sports facilities of national or regional significance.  Many of these have been funded under the sports capital programme since 1999 and a considerable bank of information already exists, although some of this information is not up to date and, therefore, a complete set of data has to be obtained.  In addition, details of facilities at third level educational institutions and swimming pools have also been included on this inventory.  Further engagement with the main sporting bodies, local authorities and facility owners and managers is being undertaken so a comprehensive database on the range and nature of sporting facilities at national and regional level can be completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">By ascertaining and mapping what is already in place at a national and regional level, an important part of developing a strategic approach to future facility provision will be put in place, as well as establishing the level of need that exists in the sports sector and helping to determine future priorities.  As I have previously explained, the enormity of completing the full audit of sports facilities should not be underestimated and, given the experience of other countries, is likely to take a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">With London 2012 on the horizon, there is the possibility that athletes and teams from other countries may consider using Ireland as a training base in the years leading up to the Olympics.  Ireland possesses the advantages of being in the same climatic and time zones as London, being within an hour by air travel, and Ireland will avoid most of the media hype that one often finds in the host country.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">In order to ensure Ireland benefits from the proximity of the London 2012 Olympic Games, I have established a London 2012 task force made up of experts from sporting, business, tourism and cultural interests.  This group will work to ensure Ireland is an attractive training base for Olympic athletes in the run-up to 2012 and Ireland also benefits from the tourism, business and cultural opportunities arising from the hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">If Ireland is to be attractive to potential participating athletes, access to high quality sporting and ancillary facilities must be available.  In this regard, my Department is currently undertaking, as a separate exercise, a sports infrastructural audit of facilities that might be suitable to develop to meet the training needs of overseas teams preparing for the 2012 Olympics.  Department officials have already held discussions with national governing bodies of sport and have been in touch with third level institutions to establish the type, range and suitability of the sports facilities available for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">The Olympic Council of Ireland has identified a number of individual sports facilities that may require some upgrade work to bring them up to the standard required by Olympic athletes.  Universities are also well placed to provide packages of sporting, accommodation and ancillary facilities.  A limited number of local authority facilities may be worth considering for the training camps.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">Over the coming months, this audit process will be completed in line with the standards set out by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.  We will then have a clearer picture of the facilities likely to be attractive to participating athletes in the build-up to London 2012 and my Department will then examine whether investment may be required to bring these facilities up to the required standard.  Any expenditure on facilities will be aimed not only at attracting teams but also at ensuring a lasting legacy for Irish sports.</p>

          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_277">
            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_665">When the 2012 Olympic Games take place in London, it will be the nearest thing to a home Olympic Games in our lifetime.  We should try to obtain as many sporting and tourism benefits as possible from the London Olympics.  It is impossible not to be impressed by the list of members of the 2012 task force.  The list covers most sports, as well as commercial life.  According to the Minister's answer, we have not yet completed the gathering of information even though it is almost 2007.  When one reads about the work that is being done in England, one learns that the authorities there are finding it difficult to quantify the sporting facilities which are needed.  The cost of providing such facilities has been underestimated in some instances.  We need to get the benefit of the 2012 Olympics in a way that will make a difference.  I am sure the Minister will agree that anything we do in respect of the London Olympics will benefit us into the future.  I refer, for example, to the provision of the extra facilities which are needed to attract other countries to come here to prepare for the Olympic Games.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">When will a real decision be taken to develop certain facilities to the same standard as the National Aquatic Centre and the facilities at the University of Limerick?  Time will catch up with us if we do not make a decision soon.  If we decide to provide improved facilities, we will have to work within a tight timescale when one considers that we have to take account of various mechanisms like the planning system.  The task force should be given a date by which the facilities have to be provided.  If we do not do that, we will have problems trying to gain the enormous benefits which are available to us.  I do not think there is a lack of expertise etc., among the members of the task force.  The people on it have a wonderful grasp of what is needed.  The Minister should take the initiative by setting the date for the fast-tracking of the provision of the facilities which are required.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">At the request of the 2012 London task force, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is undertaking a separate and limited audit of sporting infrastructure in advance of the 2012 Olympic Games.  A list of facilities which are likely to attract Olympic and Paralympic training camps, prior to the London games in 2012, will be drawn up over the next three months.  The audit will focus on university campuses, individual sporting facilities and local authority facilities.  The Department held discussions with the national sporting governing authorities at a briefing session in sports headquarters on 28 September last.  The Department wrote to third level institutions on 10 November last, asking them to make submissions on how they could facilitate Olympic and Paralympic teams, to give details of the upgrade work that is needed to bring facilities up to the required standard, and to mention any development plans which are under consideration.  The audit process will continue for the rest of 2006 and will be completed early in 2007.  We will then have a more comprehensive idea of the quality of the facilities which are available, whether they need to be upgraded and the level of expenditure required to bring the facilities up to the standard required by potential visiting athletes.  It is anticipated that proposals will be presented to the Government in early 2007.  I will seek funding for the upgrading of facilities, if such work is deemed worthwhile.  Upgrade work that is done will focus on leaving a lasting legacy for Irish sport.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_669">A number of potential sites for visiting teams have been identified in the initial discussions.  It is important to recognise that we have a number of quite decent facilities, such as the rowing centre at Inniscarra, the equestrian centre at Punchestown, the aquatic centre in Blanchardstown, the tennis centre in Glasnevin, the boxing stadium in Dublin 8, the training facilities in the University of Limerick and the hockey stadium in University College Dublin.  Progress is also being made in devising a national sports facility strategy.  We have engaged Holohan Leisure Consultancy, following a competitive tender competition, to assist us with the strategy.  It is anticipated the strategy will be completed within six months.  The strategy will examine all the available information on sports facilities and identify the gaps to which Deputy Wall referred.  Information on facilities is held by the Department of Education and Science, the Irish Sports Council, individual sporting bodies and local authorities.  If we ascertain and map out what is already in place at national, regional and local levels, we will have started to develop a strategic approach to the future provision of facilities, established the level of need that exists in the sports sector and helped to determine future priorities.  We are continuing with phase 1 of the Abbotstown project.  Some €119 million has been included in my Department's capital envelope to complete that phase of the project by the end of 2010.  In that context, I intend to bring further proposals to the Government soon, arising from the deliberations of the national sports development authority, which will be established on 1 January next to succeed Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited with regard to the second priority of the plans.</p>

         the extent to which his support for the promotion of arts, sport and tourism is reflected in financial allocation by or from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_281" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_671">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 2, which I answered a short time ago.  In that reply, I outlined in considerable detail the 2007 Estimates allocations and priorities of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I will illustrate the significant financial support the Government has given the arts, sport and tourism sectors.  In 2003, which was the first full year of operation of the new Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department's current and capital provisions were €278.781 million and €120.73 million, respectively.  Following significant increases in the intervening years, the figures for 2007 are €399.759 million and €298.842 million, respectively, representing increases of 43.4% and 147.5% on the 2003 figures.  I will cite some significant examples of the Government's financial support for the sectors under my remit.  The total funding given to the Arts Council will increase by 52% in just four years, from €52.5 million in 2004 to €80 million in 2007.  The total funding given to the Irish Sports Council in 2000, which was its first full year of operation, was €13.5 million, whereas its total budget for 2007 will be more than €49 million.  The tourism marketing fund, which amounted to €18 million in 2000, now stands at €40 million and will increase further to €45 million in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">I propose to draw Deputy Durkan's attention to some examples of the Government's investment in capital projects and programmes.  It has provided €191 million towards the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium.  It has offered financial support for the development of local, regional and national sports facilities, including public swimming pools, which have been allocated over €430 million between 2003 and 2007.  The Government has decided to proceed with the construction of a national conference centre, through a public private partnership process.  The National Concert Hall and the national theatre are being redeveloped.  The Government has committed €119 million towards the provision of the sports campus at Abbotstown.  Members will agree that these figures, which speak for themselves, demonstrate beyond doubt the Government's immense support for these sectors.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_282">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_673">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I tabled Question No. 6 to ascertain the full extent of the Minister's commitment to his various areas of responsibility.  I was particularly keen to get information about the arts, to which Deputy Deenihan referred in the context of a previous question.  I have had difficulty getting such information in the past.  I compliment the Minister on the work that has been done in the areas of sport and recreation.  Such work was needed in my constituency as a result of the increases in population.  Can the Minister indicate how he intends to promote the arts among young people and local communities?  In many cases, local community groups, musical societies and drama societies in my constituency and in every other part of the country have no permanent base and have to make applications to the Arts Council for funding.  The response they receive is that the resources are not there to meet the requirements.  Will the Minister look favourably at developing communities in the satellite towns in the eastern region?  Will he give recognition to those communities with a view to specific promotion of the arts?  In view of the likely increase of the population in the future, will he specifically identify a programme whereby the development and provision of facilities for the arts can be promoted in a positive way?  Can that be done through the Arts Council?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_283" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_674">Gross expenditure in arts and culture in 2007 rose from €198.7 million to €216.56 million.  There has been an 11% increase in the Arts Council budget to €80 million, which was the amount sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">The Minister for Education and Science and I have set up a committee to look at the question of the arts in education.  This committee is examining how we can influence the school curriculum to promote the arts.  I anticipate that this report should be with us by next summer and I hope that it will receive the same level of attention as the report of the traditional arts committee.  In that case, funding was immediately committed to the promotion of the traditional arts and there is now a coherent strategy for traditional arts in this country.  Through the co-operation that we have already received from the Minister for Education and Science, I hope that we would be in a position to have a far greater involvement in nurturing the arts among young people.  The obvious way to do this is through the education process.  I look forward to receiving the report of the committee, which was set up under the Arts Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">We recently announced ACCESS II to refurbish, restore and build new arts centres around the country.  Following on from ACCESS I, when more than €45 million was spent on these initiatives, this will represent a further advance in the provision of arts infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is on the right track.  Unfortunately, two groups in my constituency are expecting assistance in the areas to which I referred.  These groups promote the arts by putting on shows, plays and musicals and they often have to congregate for practice in unsuitable accommodation.  The work being done so far by the Minister is fine, but he needs to direct where the money should go, with particular reference to the need to encourage upcoming groups in the areas of new and expanding population.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The Minister is correct on the educational aspect of the arts.  Unfortunately, we are not really responding to the accommodation needs of education.  However, the arts and education are complementary and it would be very beneficial to the communities concerned if he pursued the line I outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_679">There is no denying that there is a paucity of facilities in many parts of the country and that this gap needs to be addressed, not least in County Kildare.  I sincerely hope that we receive applications from County Kildare under ACCESS II which will be worthy of support.  There is no doubt that further facilities are required.  We made a start under ACCESS I and in addition to that, almost €53 million has been awarded to other capital projects in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  We are beginning to provide relatively good facilities in communities, but there is still some way to go.</p>

            <p eId="para_682">I was not here for that reply, but I will ask a question on the assumption that the reply given was what I anticipated.  The programme for Government in 2002 suggested that a nationwide audit of sports facilities would be a priority within this Government's term of office.  It now appears that this audit will not be completed by the next general election.  In essence, the programme for Government has not been met and the Minister will go before the electorate without having carried out the audit as promised.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">Is the Minister aware that audits have been successfully carried out in major cities across the UK?  This has enabled them to target the type of sporting investment that is needed to promote sport among young people.  In the absence of a proper audit of sports facilities, we are throwing away money and not giving a good opportunity in life to our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">The sub-group has decided that the audit will be undertaken in a number of places to speed up the availability of information.  The experience in the North was that an audit of this nature could take up to two and a half years.  Work is under way and we want a long-term strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities throughout the country.  As part of that process, a national audit of local sports facilities is under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_687">Does the Minister agree that the groups that will do poorly in an audit are in locations that have been subject to recent development?  Deputy Gogarty's constituency and mine are examples of that.  With the time lag involved, we must play catch-up as a consequence.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">Was an audit of facilities carried out by the sports partnerships?  Is there a deal of information out there already?  The last reply I got to this question was that it would be a difficult process and that national facilities would be audited first, followed by regional and local facilities.  However, local facilities have the most direct impact on communities.  It often takes a while for a community to be developed enough to raise the matching funding, which creates its own time lag.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_689">I agree with the Deputy that facilities are still required in many parishes across the country.  That is why we are continuing with the sports capital programme as aggressively as possible.  The reason the audit is taking such a time is the amount of work involved.  All the facilities across the country have to be included in the audit.  They include not just key national facilities but, for example, GAA grounds, rugby and soccer grounds, university sports campuses, local authority sport centres, synthetic athletic tracks and swimming pools, as well as facilities in primary and post-primary schools.  In addition there are the facilities which have benefited under the sports capital programme.  One has to identify as well facilities provided by voluntary organisations as well as those available in the community generally which might have received grant assistance from other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">We are conducting the audit in two phases and trying to complete it as quickly as we can while obtaining as much information as possible on key national and regional facilities.  I have indicated to Deputy Wall in reply to an earlier question on the London Olympics in 2012 that we are dealing with that separately and distinctly.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_295" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_696">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 16 and 23 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">As the House is aware, in January 2004, the Government agreed to provide funding of €191 million, phased over five years, to the joint IRFU-FAI project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road as a 50,000-seat stadium.  The estimated total cost of the project is €365 million and the IRFU and FAI will provide the balance of €174 million.  Expenditure to date on the project amounts to €18.94 million.  I am satisfied that I will have ample funds in my Vote to meet both the current and capital needs of the stadium project in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">On 31 July 2006, Dublin City Council granted planning permission for the project, subject to a number of conditions which can be accommodated without undue difficulty.  A number of appeals against the granting of planning permission have been lodged by local residents and An Bord Pleanála has indicated that it will hold an oral hearing commencing on 11 December next.  Following the oral hearing, An Bord Pleanála will issue a decision which I am hopeful will enable the project to proceed early in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">Once construction commences, the estimated period for completion is 29 months.  The newly developed Lansdowne Road will finally bring the stadium facilities into the 21st century and the Irish rugby and soccer squads will have a worthy platform on which they can showcase themselves and Ireland to the world, and from which they can develop and build on the progress they have already achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">As to current issues between the IRFU and Wanderers Rugby Club, I have said previously that the dispute is entirely a matter which must be resolved within the rugby family.  I do not intend to intervene or comment extensively on the matter.  It is clear that ultimately the issues must be resolved between the parties directly involved.  Discussions are ongoing and it is a time for cool heads and sound reason.  I am confident that a solution will be found and that the dispute will not delay the redevelopment of the stadium.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">I am very hopeful that by the end of 2009 we will see the completion of the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium, which will cater for the international rugby and soccer requirements of the IRFU and FAI.  I look forward to the completion of this much-needed new stadium, which will be a welcome flagship facility for rugby and soccer.</p>

          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_296">
            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_702">I thank the Minister for his reply.  He has stated on previous occasions that this is a family dispute, but these have a tendency to drag on longer than anything else within the regulatory system.  It will obviously involve this particular project, An Bord Pleanála, etc.  Is this not something that should be put to bed as quickly as possible?  Perhaps the Minister, through his Department, can provide a facilitator who will allow the dispute to be mediated once and for all so that we may look forward to the project going through the regulatory agencies and see the commencement of the Lansdowne Road refurbishment project in 2007.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_297" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_703">I sincerely hope the issue can be resolved by negotiation.  If it cannot be resolved by negotiation, then I hope it can be resolved by both sides committing to arbitration.  Talks between the two parties have been going on for nearly a year and a half.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">The offer on the table from the IRFU seems to be quite fair.  I understand it includes a replacement fully-equipped club house within the existing grounds, a grant to include the Wanderers' Merrion Road club house and grounds and financial compensation for loss of income to cover the period when the club would not have the use of the stadium during reconstruction.  There is also to be an extension of the current licence agreement for the lifespan of the new stadium, complimentary use of a hospitality suite — although this has been withdrawn — and an allocation of tickets for matches.  The IRFU has been more than fair and accommodating in trying to come to terms with Wanderers Rugby Club.   I am very disappointed that Wanderers continues to be recalcitrant.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_298">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_705">I understand this will not hold up the planning process, but could pose difficulties in a few years when it comes to the opening of the new stadium.  Will the Minister contemplate the immediate appointment of a mediator to resolve this matter?  I am sure it could be resolved rather easily at this stage if an independent arbitrator were involved.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_299" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_706">The IRFU has requested that the issue should go to negotiation or arbitration — and negotiations have taken place.  My understanding is that the deadline for negotiations was Tuesday, 28 November.  I am not up to date on precisely what has happened.  If the final offer cannot be accepted, then it seems the best way is arbitration.  However, arbitration is something that must be accepted by both sides to the dispute.  I sincerely hope arbitration will take place if negotiations do not resolve the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">It is also regrettable that Wanderers has chosen to put this matter into the public domain.  That was never my wish nor that of the IRFU.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_300" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_709">I am happy to place on record the high regard in which both I and my Government colleagues hold Special Olympics Ireland.  The programmes which are implemented by the organisation for people with intellectual disabilities have a profoundly positive impact on families and communities.  Since 1999, Special Olympics Ireland has received core funding of €4 million from the Irish Sports Council towards the costs of its activities, including almost €600,000 this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The Deputy will be aware that Special Olympics Ireland recently made a submission to the Government on the development and funding of the Special Olympics programme over the next three years.  Subsequently, its representatives met with officials of my Department to elaborate on their submission, which is being given the fullest consideration in consultation with other Government Departments.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_711">I remind the Minister that Special Olympics Ireland looks after 11,000 athletes in 12 sports, in 402 clubs, supported by hundreds of community organisations throughout Ireland, with 18,000 volunteers.  The perception is that Special Olympics Ireland is an event driven organisation, in that it organised the 2003 world games, but that is not the case.  It is involved in training and coaching, providing facilities for 33% of all the young people with special needs in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">We were all very quick to jump on the bandwagon in 2003.  It was very high profile, politically speaking.  Politicians appeared on platforms all over Ireland, some to support, others no doubt to get cheap publicity.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">However, Special Olympics Ireland only received 13.8% of its funding from Government sources.  This is a derisory amount when one considers the effort put in by the people involved.  Working with children with special needs is highly demanding and challenging and while it is also highly rewarding, it differs from working with children in mainstream athletics.  The organisation has made a special application to the Government for an average of €3.3 million every year for the next five years.  Next year, it needs this money to go to China and it also requires such funds in the future to develop its programmes.   Will the Minister make a special case to the Cabinet to ensure the organisation will receive this funding?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_302" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_714">I am unaware of any politician who seeks cheap publicity arising from the Special Olympics.  At the time, the Government provided an allocation of almost €14 million towards the hosting of the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Ireland.  This was in addition to capital grants under the sports capital programme of €21 million to assist in the upgrading of a number of sports facilities that hosted various events during the course of the games.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">In addition, the Irish Sports Council has been highly supportive of Special Olympics Ireland and is fully cognisant of the great contribution it makes to Irish sport and society in general.  It appreciates that Special Olympics Ireland makes an enormous contribution to the voluntary sector and has, in the past three years, following on the highly successful Special Olympics World Summer Games, put its money where its mouth is by increasing the number of athletes by 28%.  Since 2000, it has increased this number by 107%.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">In previous years the council has made contributions to the cost both of the national competition and training camps for the Special Olympics.  These contributions have been in the region of 33% of the total costs and have been in respect of smaller events such as the winter games and the European games.  In 2007 the costs of competing in Shanghai will be substantially higher and the council will again seek to make a contribution towards these costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">The Irish Sports Council may be open to an increase in funding towards the core activities of Special Olympics Ireland.  However, it is not in favour of allocating specific funding for performance planning similar to that provided to its Olympic and Paralympic counterparts.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has written to other Departments, including the Departments of Health and Children, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Education and Science to ascertain whether they will come up with funding as part of fulfilling the request from the Special Olympics Ireland organisation.  In general, it will be recognised and acknowledged that the Government makes real efforts to support Special Olympics Ireland.  I hope it will be in a position to help it with its latest submission.</p>

            <p eId="para_719">Specifically, a large team comprising 200 athletes plus coaches and trainers will travel to China in 2007 for the world games.  Special Olympics Ireland has made a request to the Government to provide at least €1.5 million, in order to take one of the largest groups of athletes ever to represent Ireland.  Will the Minister accede to this request today?  Will he ask the Minister for Finance to include this allocation in the budget?</p>

            <p eId="para_720">As the organisation is aware, I have never been found wanting with regard to Special Olympics Ireland and to be fair, neither has the Minister for Finance.  I do not anticipate that either the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism under my aegis, or the Minister for Finance will be found wanting in respect of the validated needs of Special Olympics Ireland.

        <summary eId="sum_13">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_724">It is clear from the recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report and from previous similar reports — I note Sustainable Energy Ireland will present its annual energy statistics next week — that the Irish electricity market is small and does not have a high degree of interconnectivity.  These two factors can in themselves greatly contribute to high prices and medium to long-term energy insecurity unless they are properly modulated by a responsible and farsighted Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">As I noted, the key statistics regarding both electricity markets from Deloitte &amp; Touche are highly illuminating.  Currently in the Republic, peak demand averages approximately 4,500 MW and current generation capacity is 6,067 MW, of which the ESB accounts for 77%.  The average annual demand growth for the past three years has been 4.6%.  In Northern Ireland, current generation capacity is 2,396 MW, including 450 megawatts from the Moyle interconnector.  Peak demand is approximately 1,660 MW.  In the past six years, average demand growth has been 1.6%.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">These figures simply indicate that even when taken together, the two markets are not much bigger than the electricity market of Kent in England and may be somewhat smaller than that of Manchester.  The nature of electricity production and distribution means that when possible, smaller markets should be consolidated in order to establish a wider mutually beneficial energy market.  The development of the all-island market should play a key role in ensuring energy security and sustainability in both parts of Ireland, as the single electricity market framework will increase the efficiency of electricity provision across both markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Furthermore, a properly managed single market should greatly decrease the risk of power shortages and blackouts.  The beginnings of such advantages pertaining to the all-island market can be seen in the recent deal through the Commission for Energy Regulation to reserve 300 MW on the North-South interconnector.  Importantly however, the development of the SEM should also address the perceived and actual dominance of the ESB in the electricity sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The media seem to be obsessed with the ESB in this regard.  There never seem to be investigative or interesting columns emanating from our colleagues in media outlets such as <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> regarding Viridian or Northern Ireland Electricity and the extent to which they have been responsible, since the botched privatisation of 1991, for maintaining extremely high energy prices and for preventing domestic competition in Northern Ireland.  As for the South, just before Question Time I asked what is in this for us.  I refer to consumers, householders and business.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_730">In February 2005, Members were interested and excited by the opening of the market.  People believed they would have a choice of generators and suppliers.  However, aside from the ESB, operators such as Viridian have never shown an interest in the domestic market.  This is a real problem with deregulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">It is clear the Republic and Northern Ireland should accrue the greatest benefits from the single market.  Key organisations such as the ESRI have repeatedly stressed that additional interconnectivity is crucial and Members welcome the proposal for the new east-west interconnector that was discussed during Question Time some time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Members learned today that the ESB is divesting itself of 30% of its generating capacity.  The CER has approved the possibility of the ESB doing so, subject to agreement with the company and its workforce.  This would also constitute a significant step forward in the removal of the ESB's monolithic role, which will be accelerated by the all-island market.  The end result, as we know, is that when the all-island market comes into operation we should have a much higher residual supply index, RSI.  A measure of the potential market power developed by the California Independent System Operator would seem to indicate that at present ESB's RSI is approximately 0.39 and the company accounts for approximately 73% of generation capacity in the entire market.  Modelling carried out by the ESRI indicates that in the most likely scenario for the Irish electricity sector in 2010, if the all-island wholesale market is implemented successfully and develops, the ESB's RSI should be brought close to the threshold of 1.2, which is a key figure in this model so as to ensure that the ESB would no longer control the price at the crucial peak periods, in other words, it could not set the marginal price through the mid-merit plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">This ESRI modelling also indicates that in 2010 only 34% to 43% of generation capacity in the market would be the ESB's and this, of course, would be certainly within that range if the CER's announcement today comes to fruition and the company divests itself of 30%.  Colleagues might say that the approval given to the Aghada plant is going in the opposite direction, but if one was here last week for Question Time and heard the repeated assurances on energy supply this winter of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, he seemed to be whistling past the graveyard, as he often does with various elements of his portfolio.  He stated that others have assured him that there will be enough electricity in our market for the 2007 season.  Of course, there would be hell to pay if he was Minister in a situation, as Deputy Durkan outlined, where we come in some evening and the lights cannot be put on, the heating systems cannot work and the streets are dark.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">The 2004 all-island energy market framework agreed by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Northern Ireland's Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment sets out clearly the benefits that might accrue if the single market comes through, making the island a more stable and attractive investment location, increasing competitiveness, extending diversity, particularly in renewables, having a better energy infrastructure, increasing all-island efficiency and longer-term savings through rationalisation of functions and regulations, and improving the organisation of energy research.  These all are attractive aims, if they can be achieved.  From that point view, it is to be welcomed that the legislation is finally before the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I stated also that the key point is that the astonishing results so far of deregulation in Northern Ireland and in the Republic, of privatisation in Northern Ireland and a threatened and attempted privatisation in the South is that we have had ever-increasing electricity and gas prices.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_741">We have had the opposite of what we might have expected.  Despite the trumpeted market opening in 2005, of which I spoke, there is no choice for our household consumers.  The Government is not one that delivers choice, certainly as far as electricity is concerned.  It has not been able to do that so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The botched 1992 privatisation in Northern Ireland also left consumers there with high electricity prices.  It is no wonder that in a debate in the European Parliament last week, my colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and many other MEPs asked what is privatisation for if it cannot develop security and choice for consumers and if the consumers in many markets are left with a private monopoly and extremely high prices because the private monopolist is not investing enough.  This is what we experienced in the case of Eircom, where the company is privatised and investment just does not take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Not alone is the level of Irish energy policy at an astonishingly high and unacceptable level — Deloitte &amp; Touche reported that in its estimation 17%, almost one in five, of Irish people are fuel poor — but also businesses right across the country are complaining bitterly about the devastating effect of sky-rocketing energy prices on them and on the international competitiveness of the country, and hence there is an apparent rowing back.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Like a few other Members of the House, I had the distinction of sitting in the economics class of the great Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  Dr. FitzGerald was famous for a formulation of inflation when he was Taoiseach, but last March Ms Regina Finn, the former CER commissioner, used a Dr. FitzGerald style formula.  She told me that level of electricity prices in the all-island market would continue rising — we have that to look forward to — but would be lower than they would have been without the all-Island market.  Is that not a wonderful formula?</p>

          <p eId="para_746">Garret used say that the level of rise in inflation is falling.  Of course, every one scratched their heads.  Subsequently, they all went out and voted against the Government, which included my party, and we had one desperate election count in 1987 as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">It is astonishing, once again, that this critical energy legislation has no mechanism to facilitate the needs of consumers, both householders and business.  The question which must be asked again, therefore, is for whom is the SEM being constructed if not to give a secure, reliable and cheap as possible energy supply for households and businesses throughout this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I intend to bring forward an amendment to section 4, which deals with the establishment of the single electricity market committee to ensure that consumers and businesses, the people for whom the SEM was constructed to benefit, are finally given a proper voice within this new extremely powerful committee that will be the key mechanism for regulating the new SEM between the two regulators and to make sure that consumers and businesses are finally properly represented within the institutional structure of CER.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Like other Deputies, I went back to the 1999 Electricity Regulation Act, which of course set up CER.  While it is quite interesting that, under the functions of CER, it refers to the role of the consumers, over seven years all that was done for them is that they have been gouged repeatedly, particularly by this Government since 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">The organisation of the single electricity market committee is detailed in Schedule IA but there are a number of aspects of that to which I intend to return with amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The energy market is increasingly regulator-led and, therefore, the provisions for regulating the SEM committee are of the greatest importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">As I stated, section 4 deals with the establishment of the new single electricity market committee, which will be extremely powerful.  Little detail has been provided, either in the Minister of State's speech or in the Bill, on the composition and role of the new SEM.  Will the Minister of State explain how exactly he intends to appoint people to the committee?</p>
          <p eId="para_754">There also remain serious questions over the interaction of the Republic's and the North's regulators on key matters.  For instance, who will decide if a decision will adversely affect citizens in the North or <i>vice versa</i>? Section 9BC(2)(<i>e</i>) of the new Bill specifies “the need to avoid unfair discrimination” between Northern Irish and Republic of Ireland consumers, but exactly how will that be done and how will we ensure that this will progress and that the best lowest price, for both, will be available?</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Of particular importance in the new single electricity market will be the relationship of CER to the Northern Ireland regulator, NIR, and of both of them with the two grid operators, EirGrid and SONI, because it seems likely that the establishment of a single market will also lead inevitably to a single regulator.  Does the Minister of State agree that the 2004 report states in effect that one of the aims will be to have a single regulator?  If there is one market, how can there be two regulators?  This SEM committee, as the official's briefing document seems to indicate, will at some stage become the regulator for the all-island market.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I have been extremely critical in this House, as the Minister of State might recall, on the performance of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in the use of policy directives.  Section 10, amendment 10A of the Act of 1999, is ambiguous and unclear in this regard.  Although the role of the independent regulator, CER, within the context of the liberalised gas and electricity market is generally accepted, most observers with a keen interest in energy matters and a great concern for securing a well maintained energy system in the long term understand the critical need for the Minister to set clear targets on investment in the network, energy security, energy sustainability, energy and fuel poverty and retail and wholesale pricing, and then delegate these targets to CER for implementation.  The House will recall that the Minister helpfully accepted my amendment to that effect in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">One of the key driving forces of the European Union has been the creation of the liberalised Internal Market, but it seems that there is a danger. Earlier this year, I read an article by the renowned Oxford University economist and energy expert, Mr. Dieter Helm.  Both the Acting Chairperson, Deputy Ardagh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will remember Mr. Helm because he addressed the optimistically named Fianna Fáil think-in on energy matters earlier this year in Westport.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_763">Mr. Helm has continually warned of the danger of governments using the regulator as a mudguard.  Regulators have provided a mudguard for this Government over the last ten years in order to evade their primary responsibility of keeping the country's lights on.  I will quote briefly from what Mr. Helm forcefully said in a similar article about Britain, which appeared recently in the <i>New Statesman</i>.  He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_764">For many years it has been fashionable to believe that if only politicians and regulators kept their hands off, the market would solve the problems.  Supply always equals demand, it is just that the price has to go high enough.  But this excessive market optimism is not only undermined by the evidence, it undermines the market itself.  Competitive markets work best in the context of proper policy frameworks.  Governments will always intervene in energy markets.  The cost of market failures for the environment, security of supply, monopoly and the rest of the economy are just too great.  It is not government or markets, it is governments setting an appropriate energy policy framework within which companies operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Is that not the basis of what has been wrong with this Government's energy policies for the last ten years and particularly for the past five years?  I recall the headline of an article in the <i>Financial Times </i>this time last year, which read “Energy is too important to be left to the magic of the market”.  Many people do not seem to realise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I have already tabled an amendment to the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I intend to table a similar amendment to section 10 of the Bill currently before us, which would require the Minister to lay before the House any policy directives, including the aforementioned relevant targets, and to review them regularly.  Our basic objective is that regulators should be properly answerable to the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Section 10 makes it clear that a similar public policy instrument does not exist in Northern Ireland.  That is because Northern Ireland's legislation is coming from the Thatcherite canon.  The section specifically states that the Minister shall not interfere.  There is a certain hostility to policy directives as configured in the Irish system.  As in many other matters, the British government left Northern Ireland's energy development mainly to its own devices over the past 20 years since the onset of Thatcherism.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I want to refer briefly to energy security.  I am sure other Deputies have received the helpful e-mail briefing, which we receive almost daily, from the energy commissioner.  I commend the commissioner, Mr. Tom Reeves, and his staff from the CER.  According to the last few such e-mails, levels of capacity and peak demand are getting dangerously close.  On one evening recently, the gap was less than 100 MW.</p>

The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, seems to be happy enough but last week he was getting ready to blame other people.  He said that others had assured him at the highest level, which I presume is EirGrid, the ESB and the CER.  The Minister has them in his sights if the lights go out.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">Many other issues arise concerning security of supply.  Recently, for example, we heard a rumour that the ESB was to take over Viridian.  What will happen if somebody else takes over Viridian and becomes the owner of the Northern Ireland network as well?  What implications would that have for the single electricity market and for the Republic's market?</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Until today, most people would have feared that the ESB was in a dangerous limbo regarding electricity generation.  Last week, I asked the Minister whether he was concerned that worries are being expressed that our future electricity generation capacity will be inadequate, particularly from 2008 to 2009.  For that reason, I welcome the fact that the ESB has been sanctioned to build a new 400 MW power station at Aghada, County Cork, in return for divesting generating capacity by 1,300 MW.  The ESB is divesting over 200 MW immediately, a further 300 MW by June 2007 and 700 MW by 2010.  Hopefully, this decision, if agreed by the ESB and its workforce, will ensure that extra capacity will be put in place.  Nonetheless, we will still be fearful of facing into a dangerous 18 months or two years.  The Government must take the blame for that emerging energy security gap——</p>

          <p eId="para_780">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I note that SONI is the acronym for the transmission operation in Northern Ireland, while CER is the equivalent here.  We could call it the "Sonny and Cher Bill", which would be an easy way to remember it, as we have so much legislation covering this sector.  I commend all those who have been involved in the negotiations to get agreement on the Bill.  It is of major significance not just for the country's future energy policy but also as a general move towards reaching agreement on issues from which both parts of the island can benefit.  It must have been, and may still be, a difficult negotiating position to begin with two transmission operators, two energy regulators and two Departments.  They say that something should never be designed by a committee but those involved seem to have done their work well in this case.  Hopefully, we will be able to legislate in time to have a single electricity market operating by November 2007.  That is a testament to their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">I imagine that matters have not necessarily been fully completed yet because the "i's" must still be dotted and the "t's" crossed.  That is only part of what we are engaged in now.  The broader energy and electricity issues to which Deputy Broughan and others referred will still come into the equation before we finally reach agreement to establish the whole process.  I am speaking about the issues of perceived dominance and competition in the market.  I respect and understand Deputy Broughan's analysis that the attempted introduction of competition in the electricity market would seem to have been combined with what can only be described as a remarkable increase in prices.  There is an argument for going back to a single State-controlled operation, such as we had in the 1990s and before, when we seemed to have cheaper electricity.  I am not too sure that is possible, however, on a number of counts.  For one thing, it is not possible under the EU arrangements to which we are committed.  Market opening is something we are mandated to follow as EU members.  To a certain extent, the new energy future we are looking at — in terms of the need rapidly to develop new energy resources, including new electricity supplies — may work better in a climate where we are encouraging innovation by new people in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I am afraid that in my discussions with senior ESB management, both at the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and elsewhere, I have seen no commitment to the new renewable energy future we require.  There has been no expenditure on research and development in that area and no development of any real consequence in new energy supplies, such as wave or tidal, although the ESB has been engaged to a certain extent in the wind energy business.  The ESB was awarded one of the contracts for offshore wind development on the Kish bank, but it subsequently backed out of the project.  The project is now languishing when we should be leading the world in that sort of new energy technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">It may well be in our interests to have a more competitive market.  Given the political circumstances in which we live we are mandated to open it and having a half open market simply will not work and will bring the worst of both worlds.  Either we revert to a centralised, State controlled system with one company as predominant supplier or we open it entirely.  Going halfway could leave us in a position where we cannot attract new entrants or where the cost of attracting new entrants pushes the price up.  The dominance of the ESB in this regard can be managed in different ways and I am not averse to the Government's solution of divesting the ESB of some of its key infrastructure, sites where new power stations can be built, which can be held in State ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I agree with Deputy Broughan that nobody is arguing that vital transmission assets should not be in State ownership.  Even the sites on which power stations can be built are, in a sense, an extension of the transmission network and the solution could be leasing from the State of such sites on a long-term basis for operation by individual companies.  I do not agree with Deputy Broughan that today's announcement from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has resolved this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">My cursory glance at the press release tells me CER has given permission for Aghada but I do not believe permission has yet been given by the Government.  Having heard the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, speak on the issue during Question Time last week, I do not believe the Government will be satisfied with the trade off between the closure of Tarbert, other peat plants and small emergency generation plants and the building of a plant at Aghada.  I understand negotiations will centre on further reductions in the stations at North Wall and Great Island.  I cannot be certain on particular stations but the general principle did not relate only to the closure of emergency generation stations, or to Tarbert, which was already shut down.  There are tough decisions facing the Government in the next six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The answer the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, gave to my question last week indicated he expects this issue to come to a head by January as there will be a submission from the ESB or its unions to the Government regarding the Green Paper on electricity and a specific proposal on the leasing of sites will be a high priority.  My understanding of the Minister's answers to our questions was, unless an agreement was reached on this, the Government would not give permission for the State company to invest the necessary money in Aghada.  I would be surprised if today's announcement by CER sees the issue resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I am concentrating on this because it is an issue that may concern our neighbours in the North as they enter the single electricity market.  This matter no longer solely concerns consumers here in terms of a price competitive market but it is of interest to consumers in Northern Ireland as they will be entering such a market.  While the dominance of the ESB will be reduced in a single electricity market it will still be in a strong position if business continues as usual.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Another solution I propose, for a variety of reasons, is that ownership of the transmission and distribution grids be maintained by the State, but in separate State ownership.  This would give clear differentiation and create fair market conditions where one operator, by dint of owning the transmission network, will not have an advantage in an electricity market where they are competing together.  The logic of this position is clear and may help in the reduction of electricity prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Another concern I have, in terms of competition, is that we concentrate too much on the ESB, and Deputy Broughan is correct in this regard.  There is now a second major player and I have concerns relating to Veridian, the transmission operator in the North, and the development of a duopoly in this single market, just as Vodafone and O2 have stitched up the Irish mobile phone market.  It would be easy for two companies to manage the market in such a way that they gain super normal profits while the consumer experiences higher prices.  This is something we must ensure does not occur in the electricity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I welcome this development not only due to the North-South aspect but because it seems we are moving towards a comprehensible market mechanism, at least for the average lay person like myself, though I am sure it is incredibly complex.  In comparison to the local node pricing mechanism that was considered previously, an impossibly complex market model which seemed to me an exercise to entertain the highest astrophysicists, this, at least, has the benefit of being a system in which there is confidence that does not require a massive amount of modelling to see how it will work or the despatch arrangements that will apply in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">As we move towards a single electricity market we should also look towards a single energy policy between North and South.  If there are competitors in the market and we are operating different support mechanisms questions will be raised in the long run.  I look forward to the day the British Labour Party or the British Government advises us on energy policy rather than Fianna Fáil because they appear to be doing a better job.  They have initiated many innovative mechanisms including smart metering which seems to have been ruled out by the regulator in this country, though it applies north of the Border.  The British Government is moving towards a distributed electricity transmission system which is, again, something the Government and regulator do not appear to want.  They have moved towards a strong and consistent support mechanism for things like offshore wind which has a rock system.  We have no support system for offshore wind and despite being the much vaunted island nation with so much wind our Government does not see fit to support such proposals.  Perhaps an all-Ireland energy market will bring benefits to this country such as wisdom from north of the Border being imported down into Fianna Fáil, if there is no electoral change in the mean time.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">The Minister of State's speech was interesting and towards the end he said the initial findings of the short-term impact analysis indicate that at current fuel price projections the SEM is not likely to have a significant impact on electricity prices over the first few years of its operation.  I read this with interest because, when this was discussed in committee about a year ago, the regulator's clear position was that the SEM would lead to a reduction in prices in the short term of a number of percentage points.  The explanatory memorandum for this Bill, which is very good compared to other recent Bills, gives economic and other analyses and the cost benefit analysis shows that in the short term the SEM will lead to a rise in prices in 2008 of up to 3%.  That will go down like a tonne of bricks with Irish companies because electricity prices are already putting us out of the international market.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">The Minister of State may talk about further expected reductions and net present value gains in the future but a mechanism that causes a 3% price rise in 2008, on top of a rise of over 20% in each of the last two years, will not be flavour of the month with IBEC or any organisation interested in economic policy development in the country.  These rises reflect the extent to which our prices are above the European average.  Will the Minister of State clarify the reason for the price rise?  I presume it is related to the fact that electricity generators will be required to cover the significant costs of installing machinery and computer and other trading equipment to bid and settle arrangements on the single electricity market.  I am not calling for the provision of grant aid or direct financial support but for an examination of what can be done to avert a short-term price increase.  Are options available in the market mechanism to ease the cost benefit analysis?  A 3% increase in price could undermine public support for such a move, which is, nevertheless, a step in the right direction that may force other welcome changes in our electricity and energy policies.  As I stated, we could learn from our Northern brethren in that case.  I look forward to such a development.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  Energy and electricity are key issues, particularly given our vibrant economy.  All Members should inform themselves on this issue and engage in the debate on the legislation.  Before addressing the details of the Bill, I propose to put down some markers.  Customers and taxpayers must be given priority in the electricity and energy areas.  I urge the Minister to put people at the heart of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, may have two quotas in County Wexford but he should listen to taxpayers' concerns about high energy costs, particularly electricity.  Recent significant increases in energy prices are not acceptable to citizens, especially elderly people, and industry.  Consumers, who have supported the ESB for generations, are up in arms about the price increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The issue of electricity must be handled in a sensitive fashion.  It should not be treated in the manner Dublin City Council and the management of the Dublin Port tunnel are treating the water issue on the north side of Dublin.  It is bad enough that residents in Fairview, Marino and Santry must put up with damaged homes but tomorrow night at 8 p.m. their water supply will be switched off until 6 p.m. on Sunday, 3 December.  This measure is being taken to facilitate works in Fairview Park as part of the Dublin Port tunnel works.  It is unacceptable that the residents of Fairview, Clontarf, Raheny and Killester should be without water for two or three days.  The decision is a further example of management failure, not as the latest term would have us believe, "systems failure".  I call on the Dublin city manager and the Dublin Port tunnel management team to look after the residents in question and treat them with respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The main provisions in the Bill are to establish a single electricity market, SEM, committee to enable efficient decision-making on single electricity market matters; establish a framework for the performance of the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation relating to the single electricity market; provide for information sharing between the various parties to the SEM to facilitate the effective operation of the market; make provision for the objectives of the Minister and the CER with regard to matters which affect or are likely to affect the SEM; provide a licensing framework for the establishment of an SEM market operator to carry out the trading and settlement functions of the market; establish a licence modification process to ensure existing and new licensees can trade in the new market; and establish the terms and conditions of appointment of the SEM committee and provide for the way it transacts its business.  These are the core issues addressed in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Section 5 inserts a new section 8B, which provides for the drawing up and publication of procedures and working arrangements in respect of the SEM.  Section 7 amends the Act of 1999 by the insertion of a new section 9B.  This section will provide for the functions of the CER relating to the SEM.  These functions will include the establishment of the SEM, together with the procedures to be adopted with regard to giving effect to the market and the making of regulations for the purpose of trading in electricity on an all-island basis, including a trading and settlement code.  Section 7 also requires all licensees to make available all the electricity they generate or that is generated by them for supply for trading in the SEM.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Provision is made in this section with regard to the  appropriate threshold to be applied in relation to different classes of licensees.  Section 11 provides for the establishment of a market operator to carry out on a day-to-day basis the trading and settlement of the new market.  The market operator function will initially be jointly carried out by the transmission system operators, North and South.  These sections are the core features of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The regulatory proposal is the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, for the primary legislation that will facilitate the introduction of the single wholesale electricity market between the South and North.  It sets out the strategic focus and intended effect of the establishment of the SEM on the island of Ireland.  The SEM entails the development and enforcement of new all-island arrangements for trading of wholesale electricity.  This will be of vital importance to the development of electricity supply on the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Politicians, North and South, must give a lead on this issue.  It saddens me to hear Unionist spokespersons such as Nigel Dodds or Jim Wells argue against the economic benefits of an all-Ireland economy.  A cross-Border electricity body makes common sense because it will benefit users.  The leaders of unionism must wake up and recognise the sensible aspects of the British-Irish Agreement, of which this Bill is one element.  They have nothing to be afraid of and the DUP should show leadership on this issue.  Rather than stabbing him in the back, party members should support their leader.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I urge Unionists to come into the real world and work with everyone on this island.  We want to accommodate and respect diversity and understand each other. Yesterday's findings by the sub-committee on the Barron report demonstrated that we never want to return to the violence we experienced on this island for 30 years.  I ask the leaders of unionism to consider the sensible options available to share power and resources, including energy.  Years ago, anyone who argued in favour of cross-Border economic co-operation was dismissed.  It is now an important argument to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The objective of the legislation is to establish a single wholesale electricity market for the North and South, which will facilitate improved competition and investment opportunities by expanding the market.  Why would anyone oppose such a development?  This market will facilitate the exploitation of efficiencies and economies of scale in areas such as generation reserves, plant mix and fuel usage and will introduce more transparent and equitable trading arrangements.  The all-Ireland dimension makes economic sense.  Many of our friends in the North must face economic reality.  The North cannot depend permanently on Britain.  Let us work together on this island to develop our resources in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">A large number of small industries are being hammered by high energy costs and the problem must be addressed.  In my constituency, for example, the Cadbury factory provides excellent employment for people on the north side of Dublin, particularly in the Coolock area.  It and many other companies, notably small businesses, have raised questions about high energy costs.  We must support them when it comes to electricity costs.  If electricity costs are low, they will be more competitive and employ more people.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">According to the explanatory memoranda, the benefits to be gained from the effective functioning SEM include more efficient generation dispatch, leading to lower cost of generation; a larger single wholesale market, facilitating greater economies of scale and scope; energy prices set competitively, although we must guard against any 3% increase; a predictable and stable trading system; increased attractiveness for generation investment and supplier entry; increased security of supply; integrated system planning leading to more robust infrastructure on the island; and shared costs of maintaining fuel diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">It is important that we consider the economic analysis.  The memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_811">The overall findings of a draft Cost-Benefit Analysis to assess the long-term economic impact of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) are positive. The analysis set SEM start-up and running costs (€199m NPV) against quantification of efficiency/system benefits (€346m NPV) resulting in an estimated net social benefit of €147m NPV over ten years.  Over twenty years, the net social benefit is estimated at €428m NPV.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_812">With regard to the distribution of benefits, the benefit share is split roughly even — 54% Ireland/46% Northern Ireland and mostly accrues to customers North and South — roughly 80/20 split customers/generators.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_813">In addition to the quantitative benefits, the study suggests that a range of other benefits will accrue from the SEM, that are not amenable to objective quantification, including improved competition, reduced market power, environmental savings and enhanced effectiveness of regulatory institutions from pooling of experience.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_814">In addition to the Cost Benefit Analysis, which takes a long-term view of SEM impact, a study on the short-term price impact was also undertaken.  The findings of the analysis suggest that, at current fuel price projections, electricity prices could rise by between 0.3% and 3.0% in Ireland in the first year, 2008.  The impact on prices in 2009 could be somewhere between a reduction of 1.9% and a slight increase of 0.7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Economic analysis is important when dealing with this legislation but the important thing is to ensure the customer lies at its heart.  We must consider the effect this will have on the economy and on workers.  The country is mostly working now, although there are still areas of high unemployment which we must deal with.  There are still blackspots and areas of disadvantage and we must ensure that now we have the extra resources, priority is given to those people and investment directed into these areas.  We all have them in our constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">This morning I was in Coolock to see the fantastic new plan for Cromcastle, which will demolish the maisonettes and regenerate the area around the Northside Shopping Centre, taking in Coolock and Cromcastle, with new housing and factory units and a better shopping centre.  We must ensure that electricity costs are kept at a minimum so people can develop to their full potential.  I wish the people well and commend those involved in this project, particularly those providing proper housing.  For many years, parts of this area were devastated by drugs and anti-social behaviour.  When I see people coming up with creative solutions to problems I welcome them and support them.  Even if people on the opposite side argue against them, I will challenge them in this House and outside because we must prioritise and put our money into disadvantaged areas.  Part of that strategy is economic.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">There must also be an educational strategy.  There is no point turning up in these areas when the kids are ten or 12; we must get in there when they are at an early age and invest in pre-school education.  Breaking the cycle of social and economic disadvantage can be achieved through education, quality housing and decent jobs.  We can already see the benefits for those who have gained in recent years, who had been long-term unemployed but who now have a real job and a sense of self-esteem.  Many of these people are making a massive contribution, often setting up their own small businesses.  I commend those who are taking risks to achieve this.  The private and public sectors are both involved.  We must oppose those elements in the Government who think the whole world's problems will be solved by the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I welcome this debate.  This is an important Bill and we must put the customer, the taxpayer and the citizen at its heart.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_819">Tréaslaím leis an Aire agus an Aire Stáit leis an obair a rinne siad ar an Bhille seo.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important regulatory legislation, which will affect the provision of electricity for years to come.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a single competitive wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Regulation will be carried out by a single electricity market committee, which will enable efficient decision-making on single electricity market matters.  The working arrangements to be adopted by the committee, setting out how statutory functions will be exercised, will be published by the regulatory authorities in both areas, the Commission for Energy Regulation in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The single electricity market will enable efficient decision making on single electricity market matters and will set out the functions of the commission relating to the single electricity market.  The establishment of a single wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland will facilitate improved competition and investment opportunities by expanding the market.  It will allow for the exploitation of efficiencies and economies of scale in areas such as generation reserves, procurement of plant and machinery and fuel usage and will introduce more transparent and equitable trading arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The development of the SEM will involve joint regulatory duties, powers and functions for the single market as well as the establishment and licensing of a single market operator.  Work in preparation for this regulatory change has been under way since 1999 to enhance co-operation in the area of energy supply between North and South.  This legislation amends many of the terms of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and this co-operation will, it is expected, take Irish energy policy forward onto a new level of service and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">In preparing this legislation the Minister and his Department, working closely with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, considered a number of options, including a no change option and the possibility of merely developing new trading arrangements.  Having considered these options it was decided to adopt the single electricity market model as being the most practical option and the one most beneficial to both economies.  The point has been made that the ultimate objective is to serve the customers and it appears as we move forward with this project, there may some short-term pain but we have become accustomed to doing that to gain in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">It was agreed to underpin the operation of the SEM with legislation, thereby securing the necessary legal and commercial confidence for the market.  The establishment of the SEM has been predicated on the delivery of maximum benefit to customers with the lowest establishment cost, with a balance between the need for secure and stable power supply and the development of a competitive market.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">An all-island electricity market will have approximately 2.5 million electricity customers comprising of 1.8 million in the Republic and 700,000 in Northern Ireland.  As noted by Deputy Broughan, while this is quite small in an EU context it is still a considerably larger market than the two markets operating independently and will provide an improved base for the entry of new market operators, both in generation and supply.  The critical mass of this market should also serve to increase the competitive pressure on prices while providing some economies of scale for electricity users.  A single market will also lead to a reduced duplication of functions, which ought to lead to significant cost savings across all sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The benefits for the country, both North and South, in terms of increased market size, shared reserve costs, shared fuel diversity costs, the increased competitive dynamic, and the expected boost to investor confidence are indeed significant factors in the process.  The single market will establish a mechanism that will permit the most efficient dispersal of generation facilities on the island.  Transmission system operators, TSOs, dispatch independently but may take advantage of opportunities to reduce overall island system costs through trading, where available.  The existing interconnector between North and South is available for third party trading and the combined effect of market and transmission system operators captures some element of efficient dispatch.  It is anticipated that additional savings will be gained by a single economic dispatch.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The benefits, which can be gained from an effectively functioning single electricity market, will include energy prices set competitively, an initiative ultimately intended to benefit the end user, be that the domestic or commercial customer; increased security of supply — there has been concern in many areas across the developed world about securing ongoing supply and this is part of our initiative to address that issue; a predictable and stable trading system; shared costs of maintaining fuel diversity; more efficient generation dispatch leading to lower cost of electricity generation; a larger single wholesale market facilitating greater economies of scale and scope; and integrated system-planning leading to more robust infrastructure on the island.  While there will be broad economic benefits to this adjustment it will not require any Government funding, which is to be welcomed.  Few of these initiatives carry that benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I note with interest that the cost benefit analysis undertaken to date would indicate that both jurisdictions would benefit almost equally, with 54% of the benefit to this side of the Border and 46% to the North, while the benefit to domestic and business users would be weighted 80-20 in their favour against those of the generators.  In overall terms this should lead to some fall in end-user prices.  This saving for the user will hopefully encourage greater conservation, thereby maximising the benefit of this progressive legislative move.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The consultation process has led to broad support for the change across the various sectors, including the key industrial stakeholders, IBEC here and CBI Northern Ireland.  There is strong political commitment on both sides of the Border to the delivery of the single market by the target date of November 2007 and both Governments are fully committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is enacted by April 2007 in order to allow the market proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The cross-Border co-operation is very welcome and hopefully we will see similar co-operation and co-ordination of policies across the whole range of services and facilities in the future.  This was alluded to by Deputy Finian McGrath in his contribution.  This should mirror work already under way in the shape of Fáilte Ireland, Waterways Ireland and the increased co-operation between the health services, as recently announced by the respective Ministers.  These innovations have proved to be extremely successful and have brought great benefit to both our communities.  I see no reason this initiative should not do likewise.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">This all forms part of the peace dividend from the ongoing work on the peace process.  It is heartening that we are discussing cross-Border co-operation on the supply of electricity when not so long ago the very same supply was under the constant threat of attack and disruption.  We all look forward to Dr. Paisley becoming First Minister but it will be ironic to see him operating the all-Ireland electricity generation system when in the past he and his supporters targeted power stations for some of their protests.  Thankfully we have now entered into a new era of co-operation which will benefit all the people throughout the island and enable businesses to be more competitive, thereby enhancing the opportunities of attracting further inward investment, both North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">In the highly competitive economic climate that now exists, our small island cannot afford to do anything other than maximise any advantage we may possess and this Bill allows us to do just that.  The single market offers a real opportunity to maximise market size on the island and to create economies of scale to the benefit of consumers and business on both sides of the Border. The single market will, over time, remove market distortions and minimise the wholesale cost of electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">This is especially fitting when considered in the context of the regional approach to the development of energy markets being pursued as part of the European Union's drive to create an EU-wide internal market in electricity and natural gas.  The creation of an all-island energy market involves collaboration on issues ranging from improved interconnection, competitive markets and harmonised trading arrangements, through to generation adequacy, security of supply, sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">There is no doubt that there is extensive and wholehearted support for the all-island energy market as proposed.  The issues involved are intricate and sometimes competing and not all the benefits will be immediately achievable.  However, the long-term reward will be a market that is much better placed to meet the future energy needs of the whole island.  We must also act so that policies are developed to exploit opportunities for enhancing the value of the energy industries on the island, through external links with Britain and continental Europe.  The appointment of the single electricity market committee will see enhanced co-operation between the regulators on both sides of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the issue which has been raised by constituents of all Members concerning the energy regulator's implementation of price increases within the sector as a whole and to which Deputy Durkan and others have alluded.  Significant increases in natural gas and electricity prices were announced earlier this year on the basis of the increased price of oil on the international market, as well as other factors.  Despite the fact that oil prices have subsequently fallen, no change in the price increase has been countenanced.  This inflexible approach in such a critical area does not inspire public confidence in the regulator and his office and I ask the Minister to review the operation of the regulator's powers in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">We must continue to protect elderly people and families who in particular are exposed to these largely unnecessary price increases, which understandably leads to considerable discomfort to all those affected.  I acknowledge the speedy response by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan ——</p>

          <p eId="para_838">——who moved quickly to increase the free fuel allowance by €5 from €9 to €14.  This increase benefits over 270,000 people.  He also increased by over €200 the natural gas allowance under the household benefits package to the 26,000 welfare and other recipients who benefit from the scheme, as well as more than doubling the kilowatt hours freely available to pensioners from 1674 kilowatt hours to approximately 3600 kilowatt hours for each of the 300,000 households catered for under the scheme.  Those of us on this side of the House would profess ourselves to be very proud of the positive action taken by Government to insulate the more vulnerable sections of society from these price increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Notwithstanding those very significant increases in benefits and allowances, I still believe that these huge increases need not have been imposed and a review must take place, taking into account the current situation.  It would be reassuring to think that the regulator and the providers would act equally as quickly when the prices fall as they do when they rise.  I hope that greater co-operation between the regulators will see a pooling of resources and information to bring greater benefit to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The 21st century presents huge challenges to all in society in providing clean, safe energy which will allow for economic expansion, while at the same time protecting our environment.  Alternative sources of electrical generation are feeding a small amount of electricity into the national grid.  The single market will create a more attractive location for new electricity generation investment and will help to improve the security and reliability of electricity supplies across the entire country.  I compliment the initiative of the two Governments on embarking upon a joint approach to tackle the electricity and broad energy needs of the island of Ireland in the medium and long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">A joint North-South public consultation on an all-Ireland vision for renewable energy has been undertaken and this forms part of the long-term strategy for alternative sources of energy.  It is intended that a joint policy paper on long-term sustainability of energy supplies will be developed in the coming months with a particular focus on renewable electricity generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">We will clearly need to provide a much greater proportion of renewable electricity generation for our needs and the provisions of this Bill will facilitate the entry into the marketplace of those entrepreneurs and companies willing to produce additional electricity from renewable sources into the overall electricity pool.  We owe it to the next generation to be more determined and far-sighted in our energy management strategy.  The development of the all-Ireland energy market is a good example of this and I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on the work they do in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I hope that with this improved efficiency we will see greater emphasis on improving the service given to consumers by the ESB and other providers.  I mention the ESB in particular because, like other public representatives, I am aware of issues involving the delivery of an electricity service that is increasingly removed from the end user.  For many years we could have pointed to the ESB as being one of the most efficient and cost-effective utility providers in the State.  While it has struggled to meet the challenge of the growing economy, I am sure Deputy Durkan will agree that we in County Kildare have noted many problems.  I could instance literally dozens of examples, such as the number of new housing estates in my constituency without public lights for months or even years, leaving householders increasingly frustrated without, it seems, any recourse.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_844">That is correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_346">
          <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_845">Of course, the first recourse of householders is to public representatives.  When lights fail to be turned on, it is the public representative, not the ESB, that is blamed.  The repairs, or lack thereof, are a running sore across my constituency.  I am aware of failed public lights being left for over a year without a visit from a repair crew.  A town in my constituency waited for more than 18 months before a set of traffic signals installed by the local authority were eventually connected.  These lights service a local health centre and it is absolutely unbelievable that this seemingly straightforward task would take such a period of time to be completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Yet another example from my constituency is the case of a primary school where the flashing lights at a pedestrian crossing still have not been connected more than two years after the completion of the civil works by the local authority.  I doubt if the Minister of State or anyone else could tell me why that should happen.  It is not acceptable and is not the type of service we would have got from the ESB in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The delivery of this important Bill cannot come soon enough and I am confident that we will have a streamlined and efficient generation policy when this process is complete.  I think it was Deputy Eamon Ryan who suggested that those on this side of the Border could benefit from the expertise and experience we will collaborate with in the North and I endorse that.  However, I equally suspect that the cross-fertilisation of ideas will be of benefit to all.  I am encouraged that work in this area has already commenced with yesterday's announcement of an agreement between the energy regulator and the ESB which will allow for the sale of a number of power generating plants to the private sector.  In return, the ESB will build a new 400 megawatt power station in the south of the country.  According to the regulator, the ESB will account for only 40% of the all-Ireland generation capacity by 2010.  This will be a remarkable change in such a limited time and will obviously require the goodwill of all partners in the sector, not least the trade union movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">In a very short timeframe we have moved to a position where we are now looking at taking the first step towards creating a seamless energy market on this island with the establishment of the single electricity market next year.

          <from>Ms F. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_852">It is a great thing to be discussing progress on an all-island basis and I particularly welcome this Bill for that reason.  I pay tribute to the hard work officials and Ministers have put into this.  The extremely valuable recent review of the Irish electricity market by Deloitte &amp; Touche highlighted two problems which dog our electricity market, namely, the size of the market and the dominance of the ESB which unduly influences the ability to set prices.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche report concluded that without changing the current structure we will continue to face difficulties in attracting new entrants to develop competition and choice for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">This Bill is an attempt to deal with these shortcomings.  While it will provide the regulatory framework for the facilitation of the all-Ireland energy market, I do not underestimate the difficulties and complexities of this task.  There will continue to be differences on both sides of the market, such as public service obligations, CO2 emission terms and various contracts which will have to be honoured.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">In his speech, the Minister stated that the creation of the all-Ireland energy market will bring benefits to the island as a whole, including a larger single market with competitive energy prices, greater security and diversity of supply, a more attractive investment location and a robust, integrated infrastructure.  That is expecting a lot from such a humble Bill and I am not convinced that the establishment of the all-Ireland market on its own is the panacea the Minister is looking for.  However, as the Irish phrase goes, tús maith leath na hoibre.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The establishment of the single electricity market will, despite the differences I alluded to, result in a more effective market.  One of the more important benefits which will result from the single market is the introduction of a reasonable degree of transparency into the pricing mechanism.  There will be a single clearing pool into which generators bid.  All generators will get the highest price.  While this system might tolerate and indeed encourage a certain amount of gaming, otherwise known as holding off generation to push up prices, it is infinitely preferable to the current arrangements that prevail in this State, which are neither transparent nor encourage the lowest price production.  Of equal importance to the security of energy supply to the country to the establishment of the single market is the decision the CER announced today with regard to the ESB divesting generating plant in return for being allowed to build a new power station in Aghada in County Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">In electricity generation the type of generating plant is critically important.  Unless the mix of generating plant is what is required by the system, we will not be served.  This is something the regulator fails to recognise time and again.  Today for the first time ever, wind generation exceeded 600 MW reaching an afternoon peak of 618 MW.  Its lowest point today was 410 MW.  What this level of wind penetration needs, and bear in mind that Government has indicated it is looking to increase wind penetration, is flexible plant — large open cycle gas turbine generators.  These can respond quickly to fluctuations in wind penetration and come on stream within 15 minutes.  They are obviously what is required if we are to be faced with increased wind generation on the grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">EirGrid, the systems operator, has been calling for such flexible plant but the CER has once again ignored this request and given the green light to Aghada which is a combined cycle base load, the least flexible type.  It is the type that is over-represented in our generation mix.  Given that base load plant type is the type which sets prices, the effect of this decision today is, in the short term, to hand to the ESB more control over pricing and not less.  Unless the ESB is instructed to sell intermediate load plant, such as Poolbeg One, the influence and dominance issue will continue to dog our market and the consumer will continue to lose out.  A directive should have been sent by the CER to sell marginal plant and not the peaking plant in Rhode, County Offaly and the plant in County Mayo.  Peaking plant is not price setting plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The last thing our system needs is more base load plant which has been approved by the regulator today.  EirGrid has constantly spoken of the need for flexible plant in our generation mix and it is irresponsible in the extreme for the regulator to ignore such a request from the systems operator.  It makes me question the extent of corporate expertise available within the CER in the area of generating systems and plant operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The question the CER should really address is why nobody is offering to build flexible plant.  That is the type of visionary thinking in which the CER would need to engage.  The CER is responsible for ensuring our security of supply is maintained.  The fact that nobody is offering to build flexible plant should trigger a response from the regulator.  That is the critical question I would like the CER to address.  There is no doubt the capital costs for constructing and operating flexible plant are enormous but we need it.  That is the bottom line.  It is obvious that we should put in place mechanisms which facilitate the realisation of the plant type we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The market system alone will never reward sufficiently the enormous capital costs of peaking plant so we need to establish a mechanism that will.  A system, which would offer a capacity payment and the market rate, should stimulate enough interest in developing generating capacity in the area of peaking plant.  We must give it a try because if we are to allow the regulator to continue to offer base load generating capacity, it will not serve us well.  I wish the regulator would apply his not inconsiderable talents to solving this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The relevance of the single market to generation, security of supply and, ultimately, to prices will not amount to much if we do not get the flexible generation plant we need.  In the new market arrangement, we no longer only have ourselves to think about.  We need to think about security of supply for the new communities on the other side of the Border to whom we have a responsibility.  We need to ensure we demonstrate that we have that sense of responsibility, that we know what is needed and that we put in place mechanisms and require that the regulator establishes a system which will deliver the type of flexible plant we need.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_862">I thank Deputies on both sides for their contributions.  I am grateful for the opportunity to conclude the Second Stage debate on the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Electricity Market) Bill.  This priority Bill is a key element among a suite of measures which will allow the Government to continue to drive forward a very progressive energy agenda.  The enactment of the Bill will underpin the establishment of the single wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland which will benefit consumers and enterprise, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I will briefly address some of the point raised in the debate.  Deputy Durkan mentioned the development of renewables and the possible impact of interconnectors on this.  I take this opportunity to remind the Deputy of the commitment already given by the Minister to enhance targets for developing renewable-based electricity generation as set out in the Green Paper on energy policy.  I also point to the enhanced co-operation that now exists involving authorities on both sides of the Border which further enhance the prospects for the development of renewables on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Deputies Durkan, Broughan, Finian McGrath, Eamon Ryan and Ó Fearghaíl raised the issue, and the importance, of consumers.  The Bill ensures the interests of consumers will be foremost in the minds of the regulators.  Section 9 of the Bill provides that the principal objective of the Minister, the regulator and the single electricity market committee is the protection of the interests of consumers, North and South.  Deputy Durkan also raised the issue of grid development, microgeneration and ensuring appropriate plant mix into the future.  As the Deputy is probably aware, a ground breaking study is being undertaken on an all-island basis on the future development of the grid.  This study, which is due to be completed next year, is to determine the most likely generating technologies, particularly renewable technologies which will be available over the coming 15 to 20 years.  It will also look at the most appropriate grid design to accommodate the technologies and will be used to determine policy in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I should also mention that issues such as harmonisation of grid codes, generating adequacy statements, grid planning etc., will be dealt with on an all-island basis with the establishment of the single electricity market.  Deputy Broughan was concerned that this was not provided for in the Bill but I point out that these issues do not need primary legislation and will occur through regulatory action and co-operation between the transmission systems.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_866">I will keep an eye on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_867">Deputy Broughan also raised the issue of the extension of the go live date for the market.  Following a review by CER and its Northern Ireland counterpart, NIAER, on the progress of the project to deliver the SEM, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Secretary of State, Peter Hain, MP, endorsed a recommendation of the regulatory authorities to extend the go live date for the SEM from 1 July 2007 to 1 November 2007.  The regulatory authorities, which set the go live date for 1 July 2007, advised that following extensive consultation with transmission system operators and the industry that the target date should be extended by four months.  As some Deputies pointed out, the brief extension is to enable the extensive market testing necessary and to ensure all necessary systems are in place to allow for the effective operation of the market through project assurance, impact analysis and market trials.  The Minister confirmed that both Governments are committed to delivering the necessary legislation by April 2007 to underpin implementation of the new market in the run up to day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I note what Deputies Broughan and Eamon Ryan said in regard to the agreement reached between the CER and the ESB on the reduction of the ESB's generating capacity and the development of new generating unit at Aghada.  I confirm that any capital expenditure by the company on the proposed project would be subject to the prior approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Eamon Ryan raised the possibility of a monopoly developing in the SEM.  While policy measures are being developed within the context of the White Paper on Energy to deal with the ESB's dominance in generating, I also point to the market power mitigation measures the regulators have developed as part of the market rules governing the SEM.  These measures include the power for regulators to direct generators to sell part of our electricity at pre-determined prices to designated suppliers.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to the short-term price impact analysis being undertaken by the regulators.  The analysis, which is still being completed, indicates a likely small increase in the first year.  This reflects the up-front market set-up costs and is projected to be reversed almost totally by the end of the second year.  The important point to note however is the focus on the long-term gain.  The SEM will deliver major cost savings to the public, North and South, and the analysis shows it is likely to lead to savings of approximately €150 million within the first ten years and over €400 million over 20 years of operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I thank Members for their support and their welcome for the provisions of this Bill.  The Bill is expected to conclude in both jurisdictions by April 2007.  We are anxious to have it through this House by Christmas and I appreciate the support of Deputies Broughan, Durkan and Eamon Ryan.  We look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage and to dealing with any amendments.  I ask members of the select committee to table amendments as quickly as possible so they may be given full and fair consideration.</p>

          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_355">
            <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_873">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Adjournment.  The lack of provision of funding for day care centres for elderly people is a typical example of the Government being penny wise and pound foolish.  For a relatively small outlay of funds, the lives of retired people could be considerably enhanced, especially those living in isolated, rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The particular case I wish to refer to is the Stella Maris Centre in Lisdoonvarna.  Currently this centre is a two-day care centre and has been since it was launched a year ago by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The people in the area have been fighting an uphill battle since to have a third day added to the schedule with a view to extending it to five days over time.  A five-day care centre was the commitment given by the Minister last year when she visited Lisdoonvarna, but naturally nobody was so rude as to ask her by when that would happen.  When will funding be provided to extend the centre to a three, four or five-day facility?</p>
            <p eId="para_875">It is not that the local communities involved have not put their weight behind the project.  More than €40,000 was raised through voluntary funds which paid for a bus.  I have been informed that the organisers now seek a larger replacement bus, such has been the success of the scheme.  The downside of that success, unfortunately, is that there is a waiting list for the facility.  People from the nearby villages of Kilinaboy, New Quay, Corofin and Carron need not apply because there is not enough room for them at the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">Earlier this week I attended the opening of the Michael Cusack visitor centre in Carron.  It is sad that on the one hand we can applaud and cherish the achievements of people such as Michael Cusack, but on the other hand ignore the living people who paid taxes through the lean years of the economy, who worked hard all their lives and made sacrifices for their children and parents, and who now find themselves neglected by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">Provision of funding for day care centres is a form of preventative medicine.  It provides a physical and mental outlet for elderly people who, too often, find themselves home alone with little social contact.  People in such situations often get ill or decline rapidly when they have so much inactivity forced upon them.  That in turn puts an immense strain on our acute hospital services and our nursing homes which have been so much in the news recently.  I cannot think of a better way for the Department of Health and Children to spend its budget than to rapidly expand its provision for day care centres throughout the country and explore means of opening new ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">In my constituency of Clare, there are just six day-care centres, Lisdoonvarna, Kilmaley, Clarecastle, Raheen, Ennistymon and Kilrush and all need to be expanded.  In addition, considerable efforts have been made to establish a centre in Sixmilebridge and again the local communities there have been very generous in providing voluntary funding to go towards such a centre.  I take this opportunity to impress upon the Department the urgent need to back this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">I had the pleasure this week of visiting the Lisdoonvarna centre.  The Stella Maris centre currently has 60 people on its books, from Lisdoonvarna, Doolin, Ballyvaughan, and Fanore.  An average of approximately 25 people attend the centre on each of the days it is open.  The centre is run by four hardworking staff, including the bus driver.  During those days it is open all day.  Its main role is as a social outlet, where people meet up with old friends and make new ones.  There are activities such as painting, crafts and quizzes.  Physical exercise is an important part of the programme and the centre is part of Go for Life national programme for elderly people.  This is a commendable programme which is run in partnership with HSE health promotion officers and which saves thousands if not millions on physiotherapy services and the like.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">The centre also has a hairdressing service, bingo and singing and dancing sessions.  The programme is a full one and has untold positive effects on the lives of participants.  It also saves the HSE, the Department and ultimately the taxpayer millions of euro every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">The people involved in the centre have appealed for an extension of at least one extra day per week for the centre for the coming year.  I plead with the Minister of State for Transport who represents the Minister this evening to urge her to provide the funding because the Stella Maris centre is of such value to north Clare.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_356">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_882">I am pleased to have the opportunity to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank Deputy Breen for raising the issue as it provides an opportunity to outline to the House the current position with regard to the Stella Maris day care centre in Lisdoonvarna.   The Health Service Executive in Clare provides an extensive range of day care services for clients.  Currently, seven day centres are provided throughout the county with an average daily attendance of 240.  Many of those day centres, those at Clarecastle, Kilmaley, Miltown Malbay and Stella Maris in Lisdoonvarna, are provided in partnership with voluntary organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">The day centre service at Regina House in Kilrush, Raheen community hospital and Ennistymon community hospital is provided directly by the Health Service Executive.  A day hospital is provided at St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis.  These services enable older persons to be maintained at home and attend day services on a regular basis, depending on their needs and wishes.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The day centre at Stella Maris, Lisdoonvarna, which has been provided at the former Stella Maris nursing home, was recently opened by the Minister, Deputy Harney.  This centre, which provides services two days per week, has been upgraded and refurbished at a cost of €1.88 million by the Health Service Executive.  This funding was provided by the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which contributed CLÁR funding.  Although the centre provides services on two days per week, the Health Service Executive in Clare hopes to extend these services to a full five-day service as funding becomes available.  As the Deputy may be aware, €9 million was allocated to day and respite care in budget 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">Responsibility for the provision of health and personal social services now rests with the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has advised that a proposal for additional funding for increased opening hours for the Stella Maris elderly day care centre is being considered in the context of new service developments for 2007, and a decision will be made as soon as possible.</p>

          <heading>Community Development.</heading>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_357">
            <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_886">The area of Mountwood and Fitzgerald Park is one of the areas of disadvantage in my constituency.  It is an area which contains old local authority flats and maisonettes which are now undergoing redevelopment.  For many years there has been a community development project based in the area, which has done excellent work in the local community in providing educational supports, community activities and general support in the community.  The project is housed in a number of disused flats in one of the blocks which is due for demolition.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The members of the project have had the ambition over the years to include a purpose-built community centre as part of the redevelopment.  Following much negotiation with the local authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other State agencies, they eventually got to the point where a community centre was agreed and designed, and the intention was to progress it as part of the redevelopment.  A financing package was put together to provide for the building of the community centre, which involved the provision of funding through the local authority, with some funding coming from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government through the dormant accounts fund, the young persons' facilities fund and the equal opportunities fund, which is operated by Pobal for child care facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">The issue arising is that one part of that funding, namely, the equal opportunities funding for child care purposes, which was made available directly to the community development project, is in danger of being lost.  The project understands that those moneys, which make up one quarter of the amount required to develop the community centre, are due for what is called decommittal at the end of this year.  The difficulty is that it appears documentation and paperwork which was required from the different agencies has not been completed.  The community development project appears to be somewhat out of the loop as much of this work is being carried out by the different statutory agencies involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">I very much commend the work of the officials of both the local authority and the statutory agencies in their efforts to get this community centre up and running.  However, I am concerned about the bottom line in this regard, which is that if this part of the funding is lost, all the pieces will fall apart and the community centre may not be built or, at best, it would be delayed for years.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">This is a facility the local community has sought for many years.  The community development project has pushed ahead with it and has worked patiently with the statutory agencies involved.  Those involved thought they had got to the point where everything was running smoothly.  They thought all the funding was in place and that the scheme was agreed and would go ahead in due course.  The risk that is now presented puts it in jeopardy.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">What I seek from the Minister is a reassurance for the community and the community development project in this disadvantaged area that this money will not be lost and the community will not be put at risk.  If there must be an extension on the time limit that appears to attach to this element of the funding, I ask that the extension be granted to allow for whatever paperwork must be completed so that this community centre can be proceeded with at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_358" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_892">I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  To respond, it is necessary to give a brief explanation of the equal opportunities child care programme, for which my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children, is responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">The programme for Government and the progress of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care services to support the child care needs of parents, with a particular emphasis on those who may be in employment, education or training to prepare for employment.  To build on the success of the programme, the Government announced a new national child care investment programme in the last budget to cover the period 2006 to 2010.  This new programme will build on the success of the existing programme and will incorporate a number of key objectives.  It will increase the supply and quality of early childhood care and education services across the board, support families in breaking the cycle of disadvantage and provide a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care that is centred on the needs of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 has a funding allocation of €575 million and aims to create an additional 50,000 child care places.  It is expected that approximately 22,000 of these places will be in the private sector and 28,000 in the community and not-for-profit sector.  Some 20% of the overall places will be for children in the three to four years age group and will provide an early childhood care and education focus.  When taken into account with the other child care centred announcements in the last budget, such as the increases in paid and unpaid maternity leave and the introduction of a new early childhood supplement, worth €1,000 per year per child under six, no one can doubt the commitment of the Government or that it is giving this issue the priority it deserves.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">I turn now to the project in question, the child care element of which is part of a larger development which has been commissioned by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Other sources of funding have been sourced from other programmes and Departments.  Deputy Gilmore will be aware that Mountwood-Fitzgerald Park community development project was provisionally approved €691,691 in capital grant assistance under the programme in March 2002 as a contribution to the overall capital costs of the project.  The group sought additional funding and a further €308,309 was provided in September 2004, bringing the total approved under the programme to €1 million.  This approval is subject to the group concluding a contractual agreement with Pobal, formerly known as ADM Limited, which administers the grants on behalf of the Department of Health and Children.  This contractual agreement must be concluded by 31 December 2006 and spending must be completed by 31 December 2007 for European Commission reporting requirements to be met.  I can appreciate the urgency of this, as there is a limited number of working days between now and the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">I understand from the Department of Health and Children that Pobal is awaiting outstanding information from the group and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to progress to the next stage in the process.  This information will need to include written confirmation that the appropriate planning permission has been obtained.  If the group is unable to progress to the signed contract stage by 31 December next, it will be able to reapply for funding under the child care investment programme.  As the group will not have to start from a green field situation — all the information needed is available — any application it makes can be dealt with expeditiously.  I hope that will not come to pass, however, and that the current application will be dealt with before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">I emphasise that the programme has been central to the recent development of child care in Ireland, which will continue to flourish under the careful stewardship of this Government.  I will indicate clearly to the Minister for Health and Children the issues raised by Deputy Gilmore.  I appreciate that the group in question is fighting against the clock.</p>

          <heading>Light Rail Project.</heading>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_898">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter, which is extremely important for the people of my constituency of Dublin South.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">The Minister of State may be aware that before the last election, the Dublin Transportation Office published A Platform for Change, which was adopted by the Government as the proposed rail plan for the Dublin area.  Under that plan, it was proposed to develop two further light rail lines between the green and red Luas lines.  It was proposed to develop a metro line serving west Rathfarnham and Templeogue, as well as another Luas line serving east Rathfarnham and Churchtown.  However, the two lines had disappeared from the Government's plans by the time Transport 21 was published.  They represent a gaping hole in the transport plans for the Dublin area and for my constituency in particular.  I recognise that significant investment in public transport is planned.  I accept that a great deal of construction will be taking place in the next few years — it is not possible to do everything at the same time — but the removal of the two routes in question from the overall plan jeopardises them in the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">As there has been no further strategic planning in respect of these projects since the publication of Transport 21, no attempt is being made to protect the alignments.  I ask the Minister of State to arrange for the two lines to be restored to the strategic plans so that their alignments can be protected in the various local authority areas.  The lines will run through at least two such areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The lines must be included in the development plans so that the relevant lands can be developed.  As they are not included in any plans — they simply have no status — there is no impetus to create or protect a reserved area.  The failure to take action in this regard is also resulting in the loss of the potential contributions which would be made by developers who would be building along the routes.  The Minister of State is aware that planning permissions for housing and other developments are being granted daily in this area, as in all of Dublin.  That pattern will continue in the years to come, at least until the end of the timeframe of the Transport 21 plan.  Every time a planning permission is granted, it limits and eventually precludes future route options.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">The Minister of State should instruct the Railway Procurement Agency, or any other body with the relevant authority, to define for the local authorities the broad paths which will be taken by the two light rail lines I have mentioned.  I am not sure if the RPA has any status at the moment, as it may be about to be absorbed into the new Dublin Transportation Authority.  If the paths of the lines were outlined within approximately 500m of how it is envisaged they will be developed, the relevant land could be reserved, rather than built on.  The likelihood of developing a public transport corridor in an area decreases as the land in the locality is built on.  It also becomes far more expensive to engage in such development in such circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">Significant development is taking place in the Dublin South area.  The radial roads in the area are little more than country lanes.  I refer to roads like Stocking Lane, Whitechurch Road, Ballyboden Road, Edmondstown Road and Scholarstown Road, which were never designed to carry the volumes of traffic they now have.  Much more will be expected of such roads in the years to come when the housing developments which are in the pipeline come to fruition.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The failure to provide for the two light rail projects in question is short-sighted in the extreme.  I am not asking for money to be spent now, but for the two projects to be restored to the strategic plan.  The local authorities should be asked to reserve the lines so that we can proceed to develop them in the future, when some of the development that is taking place or planned has been completed.  If the level of building work in the area continues as it is at present, the land will be gone.  We will look back on the decisions which are being taken at present as short-sighted.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">It is almost impossible to put buses on some of the roads I have mentioned because they are so narrow.  The quantum of public transport that is required is not being provided.  The area I am talking about is in the lee of the M50.  There is housing on both sides of the M50 in the locality.  The transport system in the area is making it hell to live there at the moment.  If no hope for the future is offered to the people living in a swathe of south County Dublin — I refer to places like Knocklyon, Rathfarnham, Templeogue, Whitechurch and Ballyboden — it will be the final insult to them.  Huge developments are being pursued on the far side of the motorway.  Even though thousands of houses are being built in places like the Ballycullen Road, no public transport provision is being made.  The authorities have not even drawn a line on a map that would allow the relevant land to be preserved.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a strategic plan is drawn up, with the greatest urgency, to allow these lands to be preserved by the local authorities.  I am probably the only Deputy speaking on the Adjournment who is not looking for money.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_906">I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to respond.  While Transport 21 involves a large commitment of financial resources, those resources are finite.  Transport 21 provides funding for the delivery of an extensive rail-based network between 2006 and 2015.  The network is based on the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy document, A Platform for Change.  The Railway Procurement Agency is responsible for the delivery of the Luas and metro elements of Transport 21.  In the short to medium term, the agency is focusing on delivering all the Luas and metro projects for which financial support is provided in Transport 21.  The Dublin Transportation Office's strategy remains the longer-term strategic framework for transport in the greater Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">Funding is provided for feasibility studies on the elements of the A Platform for Change which are not included in Transport 21, including a metro line from Tallaght via Kimmage to the city centre and the proposed Luas line from the city centre to Dundrum via Terenure.  The RPA will investigate the feasibility of these suggested projects during the timescale of Transport 21.  This work will help to define in more detail the corridors to be used for the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">The areas referred to by the Deputy are served by two quality bus corridors — the Rathfarnham and Tallaght corridors — and a significant number of bus services.  As well as providing for a major expansion of the Luas network and the new metro routes, Transport 21 makes a substantial financial provision for the development of bus services and the doubling of the quality bus network over the lifetime of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The Government has taken decisions on Transport 21, particularly on the key elements of an integrated transport network for the greater Dublin area, based on a robust professional analysis by the Dublin Transportation Office and the relevant transport delivery agencies.  We have developed a growing momentum over the last 12 months on the delivery of this large investment programme.  As we cannot do everything at once, we have to prioritise.  That does not mean that projects which are not scheduled for construction during Transport 21 are off the agenda.  Our intention is that feasibility and planning work should proceed on the projects so they are ready for a future investment programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_921">On February 1st, 2006, I appointed Mr. Tim Dalton, former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, to carry out an independent assessment concerning corporate governance and related matters affecting Bord na gCon.  Mr. Dalton delivered his Report on 5th April, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">On 4th July, 2006, the Government approved specific actions to be taken in line with the recommendations of the Dalton Report. These included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_923">the drafting of legislation, as a matter of urgency, to implement key recommendations made in the Dalton Report relating to the tenure of the Chairman and the Board of Bord na gCon, to increase the size of the Board from seven to nine members, and to arrange for the reconstitution of the Board along these lines as soon as circumstances permit;</p>

            <p eId="para_927">The Report has already been published.  The former Chair has resigned, and I have appointed a new Chair, Mr. Dick O'Sullivan and another new member in succession to an outgoing member.

This Bill will also address the question of establishing a separate Doping Control function.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">A more wide-ranging and fundamental review of the Greyhound Industry Acts is now commencing, and I will revert to Government with the results of that exercise in due course.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_932">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 24 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I refer the Deputies to my reply of 26 October last in relation to the incentives available for film production in the State.  As I set out in my previous reply, attracting major international productions to the State is a particularly complex business, subject, as it is, to the dynamics of international competition, including new and enhanced incentives, lower cost structures and exchange rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">My Department's primary role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the Section 481 tax relief scheme.  Recognising the changing dynamics of this industry, the Government introduced significant improvements to the Section 481 scheme, as recently as the Finance Act 2006. These changes lifted the maximum amount of a film budget that can be raised from €15m. to €35m. and increased  the maximum percentage of a project's budget that can be raised from between 55% — 66% to 80%. These changes, designed to increase Ireland's attractiveness as a film-making location, represented the most comprehensive enhancements ever in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">In conjunction with the Irish Film Board, the total effects of these initiatives are constantly kept under review.  Further consideration of the operation of the Section 481 scheme will have to be based on the experience over time of these most recent changes. If deemed appropriate, the matter will be taken up with the Minister for Finance at the relevant time, together with any other available effective proposals, to further promote Ireland's competitiveness as an attractive film location.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_940">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 22, 32 and 34 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">As I have advised the House on a number of occasions this year, most recently on 26th October, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional level are day-to-day functions of the State Tourism Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">CSO statistics for overseas tourism for 2005 are very positive with almost 7 million visitors, and overseas revenue earnings, excluding carrier receipts, up by almost 8% to €3.5 billion.  These results represent a very robust performance by the sector in an increasingly competitive industry internationally. Performance to date in 2006, too, is very encouraging with CSO figures for the first nine months of the year showing over 6 million visits to Ireland — an increase of 11% over the same period in 2005, well ahead of Tourism Ireland's target of 4.9% for the year. According to the latest CSO data, there was an increase of 7% in total foreign exchange earnings from tourism for the first six months of the year compared with the same period last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">The home holiday market is an increasingly important component of the tourism business in Ireland, particularly in terms of seasonal and regional spread. In 2005, 86% of holiday trips and 89% of holiday nights by domestic tourists were spent outside the Dublin area. This offsets, to some extent, the relative strength of Dublin in the overseas visitors market.  In 2005, expenditure on domestic tourism was up across all regions — albeit at different rates. CSO figures for the first six months of this year show overall expenditure on domestic trips is up over 9% compared to the same period in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">I believe that the new regional tourism structures will help to optimise the benefits of tourism and help to secure a wider spread of business which, of course, is my policy objective.  As Deputies will be aware, on 29 August last I announced the appointment of the Chairs of the five new Regional Tourism Development Boards.   I understand from Fáilte Ireland that all the Boards are now in place, and that four Boards have held their inaugural meeting with the fifth due to be held shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">The key priority for the new Boards is to ensure a greater focus on the individual needs of each region at a national level and direct involvement for the regions in the development of national policy and tourism strategy.  In this regard I expect that each Board will take into account the needs of all sub-sectors of the Tourism industry, including those of the bed and breakfast providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">While the new regional tourism arrangements provide the potential for enhanced tourism performance in the regions, various region specific initiatives introduced this year by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Ltd will further help to address this situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">In 2006, Fáilte Ireland is investing in excess of €60m on developing regional tourism, from supporting local festivals to building capability and strengthening the tourism product itself.  Of this amount Fáilte Ireland is channelling €10m directly to the regions to strengthen and enhance their operational and marketing capabilities this year. This investment is designed to ensure both a high quality visitor servicing experience at key tourist information offices and also a strong overseas promotional effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The "Super-Regions" initiative launched by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland earlier this year is based on new strategic marketing alliances between adjoining Tourism Regions, positioning them to more fully exploit international market opportunities.  The initiative, which presents a better, more tangible concept of Ireland's regions to potential consumers abroad, has been well received by the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">Other Fáilte Ireland key initiatives include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_950">The new Local Area Marketing Fund to support the industry in generating additional business in 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_951">An investment of €4m by Fáilte Ireland to sustain the recent remarkable growth in the home market.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Activities and attractions — things to do and see — are central to increasing visitor spend and it is especially important for rural areas to configure their accommodation and activity offering to appeal to Irish and overseas tourists.  I welcome, in particular, recent initiatives taken by the bed and breakfast sector in this area.  Over the past three years, Fáilte Ireland, under its ERDF co-funded Tourism Product Development Scheme, has allocated over €45m to support 70 capital projects across the country.  It will continue to assist in product development including, for example, looped walks, angling, festivals, cycling routes, equestrian, golfing and water based activities, and to support, through its €1m innovation fund, industry groups seeking to develop and market new tourism initiatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 25 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">As I have informed the House, most recently on 26 October last, Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium has been appointed Preferred Tenderer for the provision of a National Conference Centre in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">As the Deputies are aware, the Centre is being procured under a Public Private Partnership process under the auspices of the Office of Public Works — the Contracting Authority.  During the Preferred Tenderer phase the Consortium is required to develop and provide the full range of project documents for review and approval by the Contracting Authority.  The current expectation is that the contract will, subject to Government agreement, be awarded before the end of December.  It is envisaged that site enabling and related works in preparation for construction would commence shortly thereafter and that the Centre would be operational in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">I am delighted that delivery of another major commitment in the Programme for Government is now in sight, subject, as already indicated, to final agreement of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">On the basis of consultations undertaken earlier by my Department and research reviewed, I am totally convinced of the need for a modern, dedicated National Conference Centre if Ireland is to realise its full potential in the hugely valuable international conference market.  According to a number of independent estimates, the National Conference Centre, when fully operational, is expected to generate additional foreign revenue earnings of between €25m and €50m per year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_963">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 21 and 38 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">On 20th November 2006, following consultation with my colleague, Ms Mary Coughlan TD, the Minister for Agriculture and Food,  I announced the establishment of a new Agency — Horse Sport Ireland — which will be responsible for devising and implementing strategies for the development and promotion of an internationally competitive Irish sport horse industry for the breeding, sport and leisure sides.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Horse Sport Ireland has been established following the acceptance by myself and the Minister for Agriculture and Food of proposals contained in a report prepared by Mr. Michael Dowling, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food, which recommended new governance structures for horse sport in Ireland.  Mr. Dowling consulted extensively with the main sectoral interests, including the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, the Irish Horse Board, the Irish Sports Council, my own Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food in the course of his work.  There is widespread support across the sector for these structures which involved the appointment of a Board of Directors comprising of eighteen members.  In accordance with the Dowling Report, I have designated an independent Chairman, Mr Joe Walsh TD, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The other seventeen members of the Board have been nominated by their respective organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">The Agency will initially be established as a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Acts.  It will bring within its remit the functions currently being discharged by the Horse Board.   Among the first tasks of the Board will be to draw up a statement of strategy for Horse Sport Ireland and to oversee the appointment of a Chief Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">Discussions are continuing with sectoral interests in Northern Ireland with a view to their possible participation in the Horse Sport Ireland structures.  There is widespread agreement that Horse Sport Ireland should be an all island body.  Most of the organisations affiliated to the Equestrian Federation of Ireland cover the whole island.  The Horse Board does not but it has effective working links with the Northern Ireland Horse Board.  In this new context those links will be strengthened and formalised with a view ultimately to having a single Horse Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">There is ongoing cooperation and discussion between my Department and the relevant Departments in Northern Ireland regarding a number of common issues and all-island cooperation.  Officials from my Department will continue to explore these issues with their Northern Ireland counterparts including in relation to Horse Sport Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The Dowling report indicated that an additional €1.75m would be required from the Government for Horse Sport Ireland in 2007.   I am pleased that this additional funding was provided in the recently published 2007 Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">I am confident that Horse Sport Ireland will significantly strengthen the horse sport sector, bringing a new common purpose to future development and lead to greater organisational efficiencies which will ultimately enhance Ireland's high standing in sport.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">As the Deputy will appreciate I am not in a position to comment on the forthcoming Budget until after its publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Since becoming Minister for Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism in 2002, I have consistently and effectively made the case, in the context of annual Estimates discussions, for increased funding for the Arts and the results are clearly in evidence.  I am delighted to have secured funding of €80m for the Arts Council in 2007.  This meets the Council's bid for funding for next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Total funding for the Council has increased from €66.233m in 2005 to €80m in 2007 and further demonstrates this Government's commitment to the Arts Sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Since 2002 funding for the Arts Council has increased by over 67% from €47.67m in 2002, to €80m in 2007. This has allowed the Arts Council to support a record number of artists and arts organisations around the country. These are significant amounts of money in any context and have transformed and increased access to the arts in recent years, and provide an excellent platform for even further developments in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">The only recommendation in the 1998 Murphy Report of direct relevance to my Department concerned the issue of funding.  The Report recommended that increased public funding be allocated through the Irish Sports Council, which is the statutory body responsible for the development of sport, to Swim Ireland for necessary reorganisation and training.  Since 1999, Swim Ireland has received over €3.6 million in funding from the Irish Sports Council, with grants of €804,500 in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">A number of other recommendations related to the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children, Justice Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science and these recommendations were brought to the attention of those Departments for their information.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The Irish Sports Council is satisfied that Swim Ireland has been restructured and refocused in accordance with the recommendations of the Murphy Report.  Since the publication of the Report in 1998, further changes have taken place in best practice and legislation on child welfare by the Department of Health and Children together with reviews and updates to the Irish Sports Council's Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport.</p>

It is hoped that a suitable design will be available by summer 2007.  Once the design has been selected a competition will then be held to procure the contract for the PPP.

            <p eId="para_999">The main vehicle for capital funding through my Department is the Arts &amp; Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS), under which almost €43 million was provided for some 40 arts and cultural facilities around the country.  This scheme commenced in 2001 but many projects are still in the course of completion.  The increase in the availability of facilities and the enhancement of their quality, as a result of the scheme, has greatly improved access to and participation in the arts for a great many people all around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">In addition to ACCESS, almost €53m has been awarded to Other Capital Projects in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  These projects, while not formally part of the ACCESS scheme, are managed in the same way as the ACCESS projects and the same objectives apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">I propose to circulate for inclusion in the written report a schedule detailing allocations on a county-by-county basis in tabular format.  All available funds are fully allocated as of now.  However, a second round of the very successful ACCESS programme closed for applications on November 17th.  The selection of projects will be undertaken in close collaboration with the Arts Council. An independent Selection Committee will assess project proposals received and will make recommendations to me for consideration.  I hope, however, to be in a position to announce the successful applicants early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">There are no plans to carry out an analysis of the geographical distribution of arts facilities across the country.  However, applications for capital arts grants under the ACCESS II scheme must be compatible with the National Spatial Strategy and in the case of new buildings the promoters must demonstrate a proven need for the facility within the relevant area.  They must also show that they have assessed the impact on other similar facilities within the relevant catchment area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1109">I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">As I informed the House on 26 October, last, Fáilte Ireland, in conjunction with the PGA/European Tour, have commissioned Deloitte and Touche to conduct an economic impact assessment on the Ryder Cup in Ireland and I look forward to the results of their work, which are expected early in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">In the meantime, the success of Ryder Cup 2006, in terms of organisation and the presentation of a positive image of Ireland, has been widely acclaimed.  Based on the experience of past tournaments, it has been estimated that the economic benefits of the event to Ireland are of the order of €130m.  It is expected that, over the coming years, there will also be a lasting long-term benefit to the tourism industry, and the golf tourism sector in particular, as a result of the worldwide television coverage of the event and the raising of Ireland's profile generally.  Furthermore, the positive experiences of overseas visitors to the event will serve as a valuable source of word-of-mouth marketing for our tourism industry for many years to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">While figures for visitors travelling here specifically for the Ryder Cup are not available, CSO figures show that Ireland hosted 738,400 overseas visitors in September.  This is an increase of 14% on the corresponding month in 2005.  The number of visitors from North America alone increased by over 19% on September 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_1116">In November 2005, the Government gave its assent to the commencement of Phase One of the development of the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown.  The estimated overall cost of the Phase One development is €119m and development is scheduled to take place over a 4 to 5 year period.  Funds for the delivery of the project have been provided in my Department's capital envelope for 2006-2010.

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1118">a National Field Sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey;</p>

In this regard, an inter-agency group is currently at work; it is chaired by the Office of Public Works and includes my Department.  The Planning Study is currently underway and is expected to be completed before the end of the year.  When agreed it will act as a blue-print for the planning process for each facility to be provided at Abbotstown over the next four years.  In the meantime, planning and preparatory work for this project has commenced and work is already underway on the refurbishment of the State Laboratory as the new headquarters for FAI Ireland.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_379">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">The Government recognises that investment in sport can yield very tangible returns in improved fitness and health for individuals which can help combat obesity and result in a consequent reduction in the demand on health services.  The unprecedented Government investment of €900m in sport since 1997 has enabled the development of modern well equipped and well managed sporting facilities throughout the country supported by a wide range of programmes which are having a real benefit to our communities.  The recently published Abridged Estimates of Public Expenditure for 2007 provides for a total budget of over €316 million for sport, an increase of 30% over 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">The 2007 budget for the Irish Sports Council (ISC) has increased by 20% or over €8 million to more than €49 million.  This continued increased level of funding ensures that the ISC can continue to embark on initiatives and programmes which increase participation in sport and physical recreation by people of all ages in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">Under the ISC's latest strategy "Building Sport for Life" 2006-2008, the Council will focus its efforts on increasing the number of people participating in sport and physical activity and its stated objectives include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1128">Increase the number of people participating in sport in partnership with governing bodies of sport, sports partnerships and other relevant agencies.  The target is to increase adult participation rates by 1.5% over the life of the strategy.  This increase will be sub-divided as follows- a reduction of 1.5% in the number of totally inactive adults and an increase of 1.5% in the number of adults meeting the recommended minimum level of health-enhancing physical activity (30 minutes per day  x 5 weekly)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1129">Increase by 3% in the number of children taking part in some level of extra curricular sport and extra school sport combined</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1130">The Local Sports Partnerships are charged with increasing participation and ensuring that the experiences in sport are positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">The ISC has created a new Participation Unit to implement its plans for increasing participation.  The Unit will ensure the national rollout of the Local Sports Partnerships network in order to deliver greater access to sport for all.  It will work with specific national governing bodies to deliver large-scale participation programmes.  The Unit will target sections of the community for intervention programmes such as the existing Women in Sport and Sport for Older People initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The Council will facilitate the creation of a sustainable structure to ensure the strategic development of sport by providing resources to National Governing Bodies and Local Sports Partnerships who are charged with providing evidence of increased levels of participation across a range of sports.  It will strengthen its relationship with the National Coaching and Training Centre in order to encourage governing bodies and sports partnerships to develop coaching infrastructures nationally and locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The Buntús Programme is also continuing to be rolled out by the ISC through the Local Sports Partnership network to primary schools.  The Programme aims to support the primary PE curriculum by providing equipment, resource cards and training to teachers and allows teachers and introductory level coaches introduce sport to children in a safe and fun way.  A new initiative "Buntús Start" aimed at pre-school children is also being implemented by the Sports Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">With regard to the provision of quality sports and recreational facilities throughout the country, the total 2007 capital budget for grants for sports facilities, including swimming pools, will be almost €88 million.  This will be used to meet payments in respect of commitments already made as well as those to be made in 2007 under the Sports Capital and Local Authority Swimming Pool Programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">Between 1998 and 2006, a total of €472m has been allocated to over 5,755 projects throughout the country under the Sport Capital Programme.  Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme 23 swimming pool projects have been completed since 2000 and a further 15 are currently under construction at locations throughout the country.  The Deputy will be aware that the task force on obesity established by the Department of Health and Children and which published its report in May 2005 was chaired by Mr. John Treacy, Chief Executive of the Irish Sports Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">I am satisfied that the programmes provided by the Irish Sports Council to increase participation together with the improved sporting facilities now in place throughout the country as a result of Government investment are providing real solutions to the problem of obesity.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_1138">I have had a number of meetings with both the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) and the GAA, most recently last month, at which player welfare issues for inter-county players were discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">At these meetings and in subsequent letters to both the GPA and the GAA, I have set out the position of the Government on this issue.  Firstly, it is entirely a matter for the GAA, as the Governing Body for Gaelic Games, to determine whether or not it wishes to embrace professionalism in any form.  The Government has no wish to influence this decision in any way.  However, the Government for reasons of sporting policy and priorities is not prepared to make public funds available to finance "pay for play".  The Government commends the shared aspiration of both the GAA and the GPA to address player welfare concerns in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect and recent comments by the President of the GAA reaffirm his resolve to deal with the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">It is a matter for the GAA in the first instance to determine how it will meet the cost of addressing player welfare needs.  I have already indicated to the GAA and the GPA that I would be prepared to respond positively to a request from the GAA for assistance in managing the additional financial impacts on the Association of the cost of enhanced player welfare services.  In that regard, I have suggested that one approach might be for the Government to commit to a programme of investment in the provision of appropriate training facilities for county teams — which the GAA has acknowledged to be a particular priority.  The parameters for such a scheme are clear cut — enhanced investment under the Sports Capital Programme over a period of years but there may also be other options worthy of consideration.  However, it would be premature to lock into a particular financing mechanism at this stage until agreement has been reached between the GAA and the GPA on arrangements to enhance player welfare and the additional costs arising for the GAA have been established.  I hope that the negotiations currently underway between the GAA and the GPA will reach a successful conclusion.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_1142">The Irish Sports Council was set up as a statutory body in July 1999 with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.  The Sports Council provides funding to recognised National Governing Bodies (NGBs) including Swim Ireland, the national governing body for swimming and associated aquatic sports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">Since 1999, Swim Ireland has received over €3.6 million in funding from the Irish Sports Council, with grants of €804,500 in 2006.  Of the money allocated to Swim Ireland in 2006, core funding of €463,500 was given to fund the delivery of its strategy in the areas of swimming, water polo and diving; €255,000 was targeted at high performance; and €86,000 was paid under the International Carding Scheme, which provides direct support in terms of grant-aid and indirect support in terms of sport science and medical backup to elite and top aspiring athletes.  In addition to this funding, Swim Ireland has also received €141,000 since 2005 under the Women in Sport initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, my Department provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool.  The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs (90% in the case of disadvantaged areas), subject to a maximum of €3.8 million.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The priority under the current round of this Programme is to continue to support those projects remaining to be completed.  Of the 57 projects being dealt with, 23 projects have been completed, with a further 15 under construction or about to begin construction throughout the country.  The total investment in these 38 projects is over €307 million and my Department is providing grant aid of some €128 million.  The remaining 19 projects are at various stages in the programme — 5 at tender stage, 8 at contract document stage and 6 at preliminary report stage.  My Department is currently finalising an expenditure review of this programme.  On completion of this review, the question of re-opening the programme can be considered.  If the Pool Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">As regards the National Aquatic Centre, it is the first facility to be developed at the Campus of Sports Facilities at Abbotstown and was opened in 2003.  In addition to public access to the facilities, an arrangement is in place whereby some 1,300 hours of free usage of the Centre is provided to Swim Ireland and its affiliates for the training needs of our elite swimmers, and whereby access is given to many local groups through programmes organised by the Fingal Sports Partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">The National Aquatic Centre is a world-class facility which has successfully hosted a number of competitive and international events including the swimming events of the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games in June 2003; and the European Short Course Swimming Championships in December 2003 and I would hope that other major events are held there in the future.  The latter event, received support of €350,000 under Fáilte Ireland's International Sports Tourism Initiative.  It is primarily a matter for Swim Ireland as the governing body for the sport of swimming to decide on the locations for its national and international events.</p>

            <p eId="para_1149">Combating illegal, harmful and predatory use of the Internet requires responses at national, EU and international levels.  Ireland is fully committed to playing its part, at home and internationally, to both detect and prevent child pornography.  Ireland's Child Trafficking and Pornography Act (1998) is acknowledged as one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere.  In terms of enforcement, in Ireland, as well as in most jurisdictions, what is illegal off-line is considered illegal on-line.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">On the structural side, a system of self-regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry is in place, the components of which include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1151">an Internet Advisory Board (IAB) which promotes awareness of Internet downside issues and monitors the progress of self regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1152">a public hotline for reporting child pornography; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1153">an industry Code of Practice and Ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">The Internet Advisory Board was established in February 2000.  As well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet Service Providers, it encourages best practice procedures, provides advice and facilitates research in internet-related issues including child safety.  My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the Board's work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">The IAB in its role of encouraging best practice procedures and formulating advice on Internet downside issues is currently evaluating the use of electronic technology which can be used to block access to websites on the internet and is preparing a report on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">The Deputy may also be aware that the Hotline (<i>www.hotline.ie</i>) referred to above accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the Internet.  Special protocols operate between the Garda and the Hotline which maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">The Hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of the international INHOPE Association (<i>www.inhope.org</i>) a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world.  The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">The self-regulatory approach to Internet regulation is the norm at EU level and indeed world-wide.  The Internet Advisory Board helps and supports the Irish Internet Service Provider industry to deliver an effective self-regulation environment, in accordance with a Code of Practice and Ethics for the industry, agreed with the Board in February 2002.  The Irish Code of Practice and Ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its type.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">The Deputy may also be aware that the European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of the Internet.  Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the Internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children.  A new  EU action plan  — Safer Internet Plus — covering the period 2005 to 2008, and with a budget of €45m, was agreed under the Irish presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation.  My Department is represented on the management committee for the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003.  While the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, my Department is preparing additional legislative provisions to ensure compliance with this Framework Decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">In July, 2006 the Government gave approval for drafting of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2006 which includes a number of provisions aimed at introducing certain changes and improvements in the operation of the Criminal Justice system.  It is expected that drafting of the Bill in question will be completed early in 2007.  The Bill will also give legislative effect to a number of international instruments including the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime which is the first international treaty dealing with criminal offences by means of, or against, computer networks, in particular distribution of child pornography, computer related fraud, network security and infringement of copyright.  The aim of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal approach aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime.</p>

In relation to the application referred to by the Deputy, the Tribunal considers that there was no undue delay in arranging a hearing date in this instance.  I am informed by the Tribunal that the documentation required in connection with the appeal was not received in full until March 2006.  I am further informed that a hearing date of 17 November 2006 was offered to the applicant's solicitor, by telephone call on 20 October 2006 and in writing on 25 October 2006 but that this date was refused by the applicant's solicitor on the grounds that it was unsuitable.  At this stage, the Tribunal is not in a position to make available an alternative hearing date before the end of the year but has assured me that a new hearing date for the applicant will be arranged early in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1167">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation if he is satisfied that certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions include having a period of residence in the State and being of good character.  When an application for naturalisation is received, it is examined immediately to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residence criteria.  If the applicant does not meet the residency requirements s/he is informed accordingly and advised of his/her right to re-apply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at a later date. If the applicant has the necessary residence in the State, the application will then be considered in accordance with the other statutory requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">In the course of processing the application, enquiries regarding the individual's financial background, including their social welfare and taxation histories will be made.

Any other enquiries deemed necessary will also be made in advance of submitting the case to me for a decision.  The applicant will then be informed in writing of my decision. S/he will also be provided with a copy of the submission prepared by my official's which summarises the information available to me at the decision-making stage.

The application was refused because the Visa Officer could not be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied, that the applicant had demonstrated  sufficient economic or professional ties to compel her to return home following her visit. In addition, it was considered that the visit was not short term in nature.  It is open to the applicant to appeal this decision; however to date, no appeal has been received. Appeals must be received within two months of the decision to refuse the application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1172">The person concerned arrived in the State on 6 February 2004 and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person concerned was informed by letter dated 8 April 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(<i>ii</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  On 3 August 2004, I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of her.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 14 October 2004, in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State.  The person concerned failed to present herself as required and was classified as evading her deportation.  The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">On 17 December 2004, the person concerned presented herself at my Department's Offices in Burgh Quay pursuant to an appointment to voluntarily return to her country of origin.  It should be noted that the option to voluntarily return to one's country of origin is provided, as previously stated, in the notice of intention to deport letter which issues pursuant to Section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(<i>ii</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.  However this option ceases once a deportation order has been signed by me.  The deportation order in this case was enforced by the GNIB on 23 December 2004.  Correspondence was recently received from this person and is under consideration by my officials.</p>

These systems will use wireless CCTV technology which will allow CCTV cameras to be redeployed as necessary to meet changing policing requirements.  Contractors will be required to complete the deployment of these CCTV systems before the end of March 2007.  Further such projects are under consideration by the Garda Commissioner as part of the process of outsourcing Garda CCTV systems. Tallaght will be considered together with the remainder of the Garda CCTV Programme.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1193">I wish to advise the Deputy that the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003.  This Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of "asylum shopping" across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Member State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another regulation state.  At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.  Under the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">The person concerned lodged an asylum claim in this State on 09 October, 2006.  Following investigation it was established that the person had previously made an asylum application in Belgium.  It was therefore determined by the ORAC that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, Belgium was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously lodged an asylum claim there on 18 February, 2005, and the appropriate authorities in Belgium have accepted their responsibilities accordingly.  The ORAC informed the person concerned of their determination on 21 November 2006, whilst at the same time affording her an opportunity to appeal their determination  to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">In relation to appeals under the Dublin II Regulation, I must point out to the Deputy that the making of an appeal to the Tribunal does not, of itself, operate to suspend the transfer of a person's asylum application nor indeed the person themselves.  The appeal can be pursued from the receiving country.  Of course, if an appeal is successful, arrangements are made to allow the person concerned to re-enter the State and have their asylum application determined substantively by the ORAC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">As a direct consequence of the ORAC determination a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 22 November 2006.  This Order was issued to her on 23 November, 2006, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 29 November, 2006, in order for arrangements to be made for her transfer to Belgium.  The person failed to attend and is now deemed to have evaded transfer to Belgium pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, and is therefore illegally present in the State.  She should present herself to An Garda Síochána or the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.  The situation in the home country of the person concerned and her need, if any, for international protection are matters for Belgium to consider as part of its examination of her asylum claim.</p>

            <p eId="para_1202">An allowance amounting to 7.5% of gross pay is payable to members of An Garda Síochána serving in defined Gaeltacht areas who perform their duties through the medium of Irish and whose knowledge of the language is certified as adequate for that purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">I have been  informed that when the Gaeltacht allowance was introduced, it was decided that it would only be paid in areas where Irish was the general medium of speech and where all the members of the force were proficient in Irish and were required to perform their duties in Irish. The areas where these allowances were to be paid were determined on the basis of Garda Districts. It was not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the force in any particular Station to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish was not also in use at the District Headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">A Garda headquarters circular sets out the conditions for the deployment/payment of the Gaeltacht allowances to Garda personnel serving in the Fíor- and Breac-Ghaeltacht areas in the Divisions of Galway West, Donegal and Kerry. The Garda authorities advise that the term "Fíor" in the concept of Garda usage denotes a Gaeltacht area where Irish is the main vernacular of the local population, whereas the term "Breac" signifies a Gaeltacht area where English is, in the main, the more dominant language of the local population. Garda Management state that in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, members must have obtained a minimum of 80% in the Oral Irish Proficiency Test. In the Breac-Ghaeltacht members must have obtained a minimum of 70% in the Oral Irish Proficiency Test.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">I have been further advised by the Garda authorities that the number of personnel in receipt of the Gaeltacht allowance on the final pay run for each year 2003 to 2005 (inclusive), and as at 30 November 2006, was as set out in the table hereunder:</p>

            <p eId="para_1218">At an inquest on 26 April, 2004 on the person referred to by the Deputy, the jury brought in a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence that the cause of death was due to immersion in fresh water.  I am informed that as a result of allegations made by the family of the person the Garda authorities examined the investigation file on the death of that person, as a result of which they decided that a Superintendent from outside the Garda District where the death took place would carry out a new investigation.  This investigation is now completed, and I have, in the past two days, received a report on it from the Garda authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">I am informed that in the second investigation the Garda authorities did not find evidence to substantiate the allegations regarding the cause of death or the conduct of the original investigation.  However, that second investigation did find that some aspects of the original investigation could have been carried out more professionally, but that these did not affect the outcome of the investigation.  In addition to the second Garda investigation, I understand that the State Pathologist reviewed two medical opinions obtained by the family and the post mortem findings.  She did not find anything to cast doubt on the inquest's findings.</p>

            <p eId="para_1232">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that based on the information supplied, they have been unable to trace any claim by the named person under the Disabled Drivers and the Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the person with the disability meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate Senior Area Medical Officer who is an official of the local HSE.  It may be that the person concerned has applied for and been refused the required certificate. If that is the case this refusal may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.  It is regretted that the Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application without the issue of a Primary Medical Certificate.  If received, this certificate, together with the completed application form (DD1) should be submitted to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Disabled Drivers Section, Coolshannagh, Monaghan, Co. Monaghan, for processing.  An information booklet (VRT 7) which outlines the relevant regulations is available on the Revenue Website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>

This facility became available from 27 November for Revenue staff and will become available for all other applicants from 11 December next, in line with agreed protocols. Formal offers will issue in early January 2007.  The OPW are currently in the process of identifying a suitable property solution.  Progress on the movement of staff to Navan, Co.

            <p eId="para_1253">The information requested by the Deputy is not available to my Department, as neither the Financial Regulator nor the Pensions Board collects such data.  The Deputy should note that the administration of pension schemes is primarily the responsibility of scheme trustees. Trustees are required to, at all times, act in the best interests of scheme members, with due regard being paid to the legislation governing the operation of pension schemes and the trust deeds and rules of individual schemes. In discharging their duties to members, trustees must ensure that they are achieving best value in terms of administration charges and other fees and commissions payable arising from the operation of pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">It should also be noted that the Financial Regulator published a Consultation Paper ‘Review of Remuneration Structures and Transparency' in January 2005 seeking views in relation to remuneration structures in the insurance market and also in relation to non-insurance investment products. This would include certain investment-type pension products. It sought views, on amongst other things, as to how the charging structures could be made simpler and clearer for the consumer and looked for suggestions as to what would be an appropriate measure of the impact of those charges and a means of comparing one product with another. The Financial Regulator's response to the first phase of consultation will be published on its website on 30 November setting out the questions that were posed as part of the review, the responses received and the next phase of the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">The Government is also committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions as part of its commitments under ‘Towards 2016'. It is expected that this will be published by the end of March next year. Given the role which annuities play in delivering retirement incomes the Green Paper will include an examination of that market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1258">Section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 provides the definition of a motor home or motor caravan (as they are referred to in VRT legislation) for VRT purposes. Motor caravans with an unladen weight of not more than 3,000 kilograms are classified as category B  — attracting a VRT rate of 13.3% of their OMSP in the State. Motor caravans with an unladen weight in excess of 3,000 kilograms are classified as category C attracting a flat rate of VRT of €50.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Motor caravans with an unladen weight of not more than 3,000 kilograms have the potential to be used as car substitutes and this is reflected in their intermediate category B VRT classification. Heavier caravans in excess of 3,000 kilograms are unlikely to be used as car substitutes and are, therefore, afforded category C classification.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">VRT is payable by all individuals (Irish nationals and non-nationals) on the registration of vehicles in the State.  Finally, EU Member States are entitled to impose National taxes provided that there is no discrimination against imported goods in favour of indigenous goods. In this regard VRT is a National tax in Ireland and does not contravene EU law in that the VRT payable on registration of an imported vehicle is equal to the amount of residual VRT contained in a similar vehicle already in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">There are currently no statistics available in Ireland either on a national or county basis on the level of diagnosed autism. The health services have, at regional level, in recent years been expanding the level of information available to them on the numbers and needs of persons with autism in their regions. While some persons with autism, who also have an intellectual disability, are included on the National Intellectual Disability Database, it does not contain information on this group as a whole. In addition while the database provides information in relation to the level of services being provided and current and future needs, it does not identify persons with specific disabilities such as autism or Down syndrome. Its principal role is as a planning and monitoring instrument.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">This issue is now being examined in the context of the overall information requirements set out in Section 13 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 which imposes significant requirements on the HSE to keep and maintain detailed records in relation to the Act. Over the next twelve months as outlined in the Department's Sectoral Plan, published in July 2006, the HSE will be reviewing the existing information management systems within the disability and mental health services, to identify what additional resources and infrastructure would be required to meet the obligations under Section 13 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">It is intended that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), on establishment, will be requested to set standards in relation to the information and data requirements under the Disability Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_1280">My Department is aware in recent years of an increase in the frequency of asthma.  The level of asthma depends on the age group and, in Ireland, has risen to approximately 20% in young teenagers.  However, as asthma is not a notifiable illness information regarding its incidence in the general population is not systematically collected by my Department as if it were notifiable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">There is no single figure relating to cost of asthma treatment.   There are a variety of risk factors for asthma and, in recognition of the environmental and genetic factors that contribute to asthma, Ireland has been involved in a number of initiatives on asthma.  Ireland has supported the European Union's Joint Research Council initiative on childhood asthma and co-ordinated an EU approach under the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2004.  Ireland has also participated in international prevalence studies on asthma and there is ongoing work on the development of information systems on asthma.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">In recent years, the Health Research Board has funded a number of proposals relating to asthma and respiratory disease.  Legislation on smoking at work has also provided greater protection from toxic tobacco smoke which contributes to asthma.  My Department has also raised the issue of asthma in discussions with the HSE in the context of their service plan for chronic disease programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1318">The European Community has Fisheries Partnership Agreements with both Mauritania and Mozambique. Irish vessels do not operate under the EU-Mozambique agreement. Under the agreement with Mauritania, agreed on 21st July last, Ireland secured pelagic fishing opportunities for non-freezer pelagic vessels.  Applications have been received from three Irish vessel owners to avail of these opportunities.  These applications are currently being processed by the European Commission and the Mauritanian authorities. I wish to advise the Deputy that none of these vessels have received grant aid. Under the previous EU-Mauritania agreement there were no fishing possibilities available to Irish vessels. However, during this time an Irish vessel did fish in Mauritanian waters under a private agreement. This vessel did not receive grant aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">I would like to assure the Deputy that both parties to the EU-Mauritania agreement are committed to responsible fishing and are promoting the introduction of responsible fisheries to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources in the area. Irish vessels fishing in Mauritanian waters under this agreement will be subject to the laws and regulations in force in Mauritania.</p>

            <p eId="para_1321">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">I am aware of the importance of the roll out of broadband in rural areas and smaller communities. The most recent phase of the group broadband scheme, which provides grant aid for the installation of broadband in rural areas, has closed. However, the nature of the scheme is currently being reviewed in the context of options being considered for the achievement of nationwide broadband. Ultimately, my aim is to ensure that the most effective and efficient mechanisms are put in place to assist in the roll out of broadband nationally as quickly as possible. Options for the delivery of a nationwide broadband service are currently being considered by a Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and representatives from ComReg. I expect to finalise proposals shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1421">I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">I meet with industry and interested parties on a regular basis in pursuit of my objective to facilitate the widespread availability of competitively priced broadband in Ireland.  The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The regulation and implementation of Local Loop unbundling is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act of 2002, and the transposed EU regulatory framework for Electronic Communications Networks and Services.  The role of Government is to put in place effective policies to facilitate the provision of affordable, high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">However, it has been clear for some time that the private sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. Direct funding has already been provided under the NDP 2000-2006 for the provision of backbone infrastructure and to upgrade local access infrastructure. My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks also offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">The Department also offered funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the Group Broadband Scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Despite private and public investment in broadband infrastructure there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Options to address these gaps in broadband coverage are currently being considered by a Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and representatives from ComReg. In order to assist with this, the Steering Group is currently seeking the views of Service Providers across all technology platforms.  I expect to finalise proposals shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1427">I have no function in relation to the imposition of VAT on fuels or gas and electricity tariffs. This is a matter for the Minister for Finance. The Irish oil market is fully privatised and deregulated. Oil prices in Ireland are not controlled outside of the level of taxation levied by the Minister for Finance. In these circumstances neither I, nor indeed any regulatory body, has any function in the matter of petrol or diesel prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">As regards the promotion of alternative energy, just last week I awarded sixteen projects excise relief over a five year period on biofuels, valued at over €200m. The programme builds on a pilot initiative rolled out in 2005, in which eight biofuels project were granted excise relief over a two-year period.  Earlier this year I launched the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) programme. REFIT allows project developers to negotiate long term fixed price contracts in the wholesale electricity market. The costs of REFIT are supported through the operation of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">Irish Aid has had a positive relationship with Self Help Development International (SHDI) for over 20 years.  From 2003 to 2006, SHDI received almost €10 million from Irish Aid under our Multi Annual Programme Scheme (MAPS). MAPS is an Irish Aid funding scheme which aims to strengthen the strategic and programmatic planning of the larger Irish NGOs through a flexible and predictable funding framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">The five MAPS partners — Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Christian Aid and SHDI — were invited to participate in a second MAPS programme to commence next year. Unfortunately, SHDI have since encountered well-publicised difficulties relating to its own governance, which are ongoing. These difficulties were not, in any way, of Irish Aid's making. We were assured on several occasions that these difficulties were at an end. This has proven not to be the case. The difficulties have worsened considerably in recent weeks with the less than amicable dissolution of the formal relationship between SHDI, which is steeped in the rural community, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA). SHDI had been the IFA's designated Third World development agency since its foundation 20 years ago. Inevitably, the combined effect of these public difficulties will have a significant impact on the support that SHDI has enjoyed for many years from rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">SHDI's boardroom divisions give rise to serious concerns, taking into consideration their impact on the organisation and the significant amount of public monies that Irish Aid has been allocating to SHDI. Accordingly, and regrettably, SHDI were recently informed that it was not feasible to continue to process their application for funding under the second phase of the MAPS Programme for the period 2007- 2011. It is not possible at this time to consider entering into a multi-annual funding commitment having regard to the level of public monies concerned and the deterioration in the financial and organisational stability which is a central requirement from all our MAPS partners. We are continuing to engage in discussions with SHDI to see how best we can continue to work together to ensure, insofar as possible, the continuance of their highly-regarded programmes in developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">It is critical that the beneficiaries of SHDI's programmes in Africa do not suffer on account of governance issues here at home. Irish Aid very much hopes that SHDI will be able, in due course, to place their current difficulties behind them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1439">A diplomatic officer from the Irish Embassy in Ljubljana was in Bosnia-Herzegovina recently to advance a further search for the Irish citizen missing in the Medjugorje area.  This was the third such visit by Embassy staff, including the Ambassador, both in the context of providing consular assistance and support to the family of the missing person and to review the search operation.  Following meetings with the local authorities in Medjugorje, Citluk and Mostar, together with representatives of EUPM (European Union Police Mission) and EUMM (European Union Monitoring Mission), it was agreed to carry out a further large scale and intensive search in Medjugorje and the surrounding areas.  On the basis of local expert advice, this search was timed to coincide with the growing back of vegetation and the resultant greatly enhanced visibility for the searchers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">This large scale search was undertaken on 23 November. It covered Medjugorje and the surrounding areas, and involved some 80 police officers.  The Krizevac Hill (a hill where pilgrims assemble for the Stations of the Cross) was thoroughly searched by teams from a Support Unit in Mostar, including a Dog Unit.  A Garda stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina with the EUPM was involved and has been exceptionally helpful throughout this difficult period.  No Irish Defence Force personnel were involved.  To our great regret, this extensive search produced no new developments.  In addition, the local police in Medjugorje recently searched two further areas in the locality, and have assured the Embassy that their efforts will be maintained on an ongoing basis.  Furthermore, the Hunting Clubs in the Region, who are active every weekend and have large memberships, have agreed to support the search effort in every way possible.  In essence everything possible has been, and will continue to be done to find the missing person.  Against the above background, there has to be a question mark about the value of a separate private investigation; I think it would be understood also that this would not be a matter for the Department.  As I have already assured the Deputy and this House, the Consular Division of the Department and the Embassy in Ljubljana will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family of the person in question.  In this regard, the staff of Consular Division are in regular contact with the husband of the missing person, who is extremely appreciative of their support and solidarity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1460">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 118 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">Tourism is a services industry, which relies heavily on labour, and Irish public policy operates on the basis of seeking to ensure that those in employment are paid fair wages. Our fiscal model also emphasises indirect as opposed to direct taxation. While both these approaches provide a strong economic development impetus, they can impact on consumption costs for the visitor. The Tourism Agencies continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness as a tourism destination. While Ireland is clearly not a low-cost destination, it does seem that Ireland is not perceived as an expensive destination to get to but that there are issues about the relative cost of some on-the-ground amenities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">In 2005, Tourism Ireland undertook a pilot project that focused on benchmarking Ireland's offering online against our key competitors in the top 4 markets (GB, USA, France and Germany) in relation to the cost, availability and choice of flights, hotels and car hire. Overall, it appears that Ireland, in the online arena, is very competitive in these sectors. Fáilte Ireland's Visitor Attitude Survey shows that the area of value, price and good all-round value for money remains an important prerequisite for visitors when considering Ireland as their holiday destination, as does the availability of reasonably priced accommodation and competitively priced air and sea fares.  In relation to accommodation prices specifically, it is encouraging to note the results of a recently published survey conducted by Hotels.com.  The results show that, on average, hotel room rates in Dublin for the second quarter of this year were down compared to the same period last year and were cheaper than room rates in London or Belfast.  The survey reported that room rates in Cork and Belfast were also down on last year.  It is important to remember, however, that competitiveness is not just about price. It is about value for money and, if our tourism sector is to be competitive, that is what it must deliver. As in most industries, there is, no doubt, scope for efficiency gains and Fáilte Ireland has a range of programmes to help the industry in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">The Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, "New Horizons for Irish Tourism" published in September 2003, set out a range of actions to address competitiveness. My Department, the tourism agencies, and the tourism industry will continue to focus on these actions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1469">Government policy for the Arts is set out in the Programme for Government and elaborated further in my Department's Statement of Strategy.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which Government support to the Arts is channelled.  Having regard for the statutory functions of the Arts Council as set out in Section 9 of the Arts Act 2003, and in accordance with section 21 of that Act, a Special Arts in Education Committee has been established to advise the Arts Council on how best to align the Council's strategies for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system.  The Committee should deliver its advice to the Council by 1st May 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">Acknowledging the contribution that the Arts can make to a rounded and balanced educational experience, the Committee will have regard to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1471">(a) the wide range of demands on the school curriculum bearing in mind that responsibility for determining the content of the school curriculum rests with the Minister for Education and Science;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1472">(b) the need to prioritise and cost its recommendations; these recommendations must have regard both to their resource implications for the Arts Council and also to the fact that the budgetary resources likely to be available over the next four years to the Minister for Education and Science for development of services in the education sector must be allocated to fund existing policy commitments;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1473">(c) subject to (b) above, the identification of what additional sources of funding, if any, might be available to fund its recommendations; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1474">(d) the roles and partnerships that are appropriate for relevant State and other agencies and bodies in this context, including the Department of Education and Science, the Arts Council, Vocational Education Committees, and Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">The focus of the Special Committee's advice should be on making specific deliverable recommendations for implementation over three to five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">I believe that by giving the arts a higher, more consistent profile at both primary and second level, we can not only benefit the arts, but can also bring significant benefits to the students concerned, which will stay with them for all of their lives. It is important also to stress that this applies to all students, and not just to those who are recognised as being particularly gifted artistically.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Every parent in the country wants their children to be creative, to be imaginative, and to express this creativity and imagination as best as they can. Because the future of the arts in Ireland rests with our young people, it is vital that the Arts are embedded into our education system at a fundamental level, beginning at primary and pre-primary level, and continuing on from there. I have always believed that the benefits of the arts for the individual are greatly increased if exposure to the arts takes place during a person's most formative years, and for that reason it is a real priority of mine to enhance the position of the arts in our education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1485">The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following: to stimulate public interest in the arts; to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; to assist in improving standards in the arts.  My Department has no function in deciding on the extent of Arts Council funding for particular projects or locations.  Indeed, the Arts Act 2003 underpins the Council's independence in this context.  I am delighted to have secured €80m in 2007 for the Arts Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">My Department does directly provide capital grants for arts and culture infrastructure around the country.  The main vehicle for such capital funding is the Arts &amp; Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS), under which almost €43 million was provided to 40 arts and cultural facilities around the country.  This scheme commenced in 2001 but many projects are still in the course of completion.  Applications for a second round of the highly successful ACCESS scheme are currently being assessed and I hope to make an announcement in this regard in the New Year.  In addition to ACCESS, almost €53m has been awarded to Other Capital Projects in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  These projects, while not formally part of the ACCESS scheme, are managed in the same way as the ACCESS projects and the same objectives apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_1501">Enterprise Ireland currently employs a total of 921 staff.  The 666 Dublin based staff are currently located in four separate offices; 402 in Glasnevin, 158 in Strand Road, Sandymount, 52 in Shelbourne Road, Ballsbridge and 54 in Wilton Place, Dublin.  A further 125 staff members are located in Enterprise Ireland's overseas offices, and 130 are located in Irish regional offices.  The Board of Enterprise Ireland has decided to locate all Dublin based staff in a single site in East Point Business Park.  It is planned that all Dublin based staff will have moved to East Point by the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">The Government has decided that the Headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, including 300 posts, will relocate to Shannon as part of the Decentralisation programme.  Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a new HQ building in Shannon.  The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development.  In co-operation with Shannon Development and the OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out.  The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">It is not possible, at this stage, to say with certainty when the full move of Enterprise Ireland's HQ will take place.  Influencing factors regarding the timing of the move to Shannon include the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants, and suitable transfer arrangements being established.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">In the interim, Enterprise Ireland is to relocate its Regional Development Headquarter activities to Shannon. These activities will include the existing Shannon Development activities relating to indigenous enterprises and support functions and the new Enterprise Ireland County Enterprise Board Co-ordination Unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">The functions hitherto carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland will revert to Enterprise Ireland on 1st January 2007.  The transfer of functions will also involve the transfer of a number of staff from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  The necessary arrangements to give effect to these changes are in train, including identification of the relevant posts and discussions with staff and their representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Enterprise Ireland will establish interim office accommodation in the region, to accommodate Regional Development HQ and CEB Unit staff, as well as staff transferring from Shannon Development. Enterprise Ireland expect that the agency will have approximately 60 staff located in Shannon by mid 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1512">Statutory redundancy has been paid to the workers in the factory named by the Deputy.  Ex gratia payments are a matter of negotiation between the company concerned and the workers, represented in this case by SIPTU.  The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in a trade dispute.  It then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  Responsibility for the settlement of a dispute ultimately rests with the parties themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">Grant agreements between Enterprise Ireland and companies are a matter for those parties and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not have a direct function in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">I am advised that the company in question has been paid a total of €1.368m in supports by Enterprise Ireland since 1986.  All funding provided by Enterprise Ireland is subject to a legal grant agreement between the company and Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland grant aided companies must meet the obligations to creditors and employees in the event of closure or liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">When Enterprise Ireland funded companies cease manufacturing, close or liquidate and there are still contingent liabilities outstanding on the grants paid to the companies, the liabilities crystalise.  In these circumstances, it is Enterprise Ireland's  policy to seek revocation of grant monies paid.  If there are sufficient assets available to repay secured and unsecured creditors, Enterprise Ireland expects to be treated in the same way as the latter.  In terms of preference share investment, this is recovered after named creditors and before ordinary shareholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">An offer of repayment of the preference shares has been made to Enterprise Ireland and is currently being considered by the agency.  Issues remain regarding grant repayments and convertible preference shares which will be considered in the light of up-to-date accounts sought and yet to be furnished by the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_1518">The furniture industry both in Navan and the country as a whole continues to face increased costs of production as well as competition from low cost economies.  For some time now, the industry has been outsourcing part of its production in order to reduce costs and maintain competitiveness and this has had an adverse effect on employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">Enterprise Ireland continues to assist the furniture sector by encouraging investment in innovation so that companies can increase home market share and develop export markets.  The principal areas of support are aimed at research, development and design to increase the level and pace of new product development; strategic, operational &amp; management development to improve competitiveness; and, increasing the level of investment in export marketing activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">The sector is also supported by a Standards Based Apprenticeship System which is operated by the Industrial Training agency, FÁS.  In this regard, an in-depth review, which took account of the needs of all the stakeholders, is being completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">There is general buoyancy in overall employment in Co. Meath as evidenced by the most recent Live Register figures released by the Central Statistics Office.  These show that for October 2006, the Live Register figure for the County is 2,853 which is down on the October 2005 figure of 2,937.</p>

            <p eId="para_1621">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The BSCFA scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is intended as a contribution towards meeting the full cost of school clothing and footwear.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.  This period was designated as it is the time that parents are preparing and budgeting for back to school expenditure.  As the principal objective of the scheme is to assist eligible families with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn, the most practical time to implement the scheme is in the lead up to each new academic year.   In dealing with the large volume of applications received the Health Service Executive deploys additional staffing resources for the duration of the scheme during the June to September period.  Where applications are made after the September deadline, the Health Service Executive has discretion to pay an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) to assist claimants with back to school expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">Current indications are that about 84,000 families with approximately 172,000 children will benefit from the scheme this year at a cost of €25.4m.  This is an increase on the 2005 figures when some 76,166 families with 157,254 children benefited at a cost of €16.7m.  This can be mainly attributed to improvements in income disregards introduced this year, and the significant level of publicity given to this scheme in the media and through the other information services operated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">Extending the deadline for applications for back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not necessary given the fact that exceptional needs payments are paid out in the case of late BSCFA applications, where appropriate.  Accordingly, at this stage, I have no plans to extend the period of application beyond September, I will continue to keep it under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1626">The average length of time taken to deal with all appeals (both summary and oral) by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2005 was 20 weeks.  If allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average falls to 13 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">The social welfare appeals process is a quasi-judicial process and it is necessary for the Appeals officer to be satisfied that he/she has all the facts before making a decision on a case.  Furthermore, the Appeals officer must give the person making the appeal and the Deciding Officer the opportunity to make their views known on the facts of the appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">My Department introduced a right of review in 2002 to ensure that customers who received adverse decisions could have them reviewed in the light of any new evidence they brought forward.  Customers whose claims are disallowed or who are otherwise dissatisfied with a decision are advised that they should bring any new facts or evidence to the attention of the Deciding Officer in the first instance for re-examination and, if appropriate, a revised decision.  They are informed that this right is in addition to their right of appeal.

            <p eId="para_1784">As indicated in my earlier reply to Parliamentary Question No. 384 of 22 November 2006, the person named was deemed successful under Category A of the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve.  Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">Successful applicants under Category A of the National Reserve are allocated a number of payment entitlements representing the number of hectares of land acquired which were leased out by the original owner to a 3rd party during the reference period.  The land in question must also have been declared by the applicant on the 2005 Single Payment application form and be free of entitlements.  The person named inherited a total of 47.86 hectares of land from three different people.   Initial examination of her application indicated that all 47.86 hectares had been leased out by the original owners to third parties during the reference period and the person named was notified to this effect on 14th April 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">However, subsequent examination of the file revealed that one of the three parcels of land had in fact been inherited by the person named prior to the reference years and appears to have been leased out directly by the person named.  Therefore, such lands do not qualify for an allocation from the National Reserve.  It was also noted that the remaining inherited land was not leased out to a third party during all of the reference period.  Therefore, allocation was based on a pro rata basis amounting to an allocation of 20.32 entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">A formal letter, dated 20th November 2006, outlines my Department's revised decision on the National Reserve application from the person named.  The person named may wish to contact the National Reserve Section of my Department directly to discuss the allocation.  The person named also has the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Independent Appeals Committee setting out the facts and contentions on which she relies in support of her appeal.  An appeals application form is available from any of my Department's offices or on the Department's website at <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1797">As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has shown an unrivalled commitment to ensuring that children and young people with special needs get the extra support they need in order to reach their full potential at school. We have dramatically expanded investment in special education in recent years and we have improved access to the state examinations for young people with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">A range of accommodations are provided to enable students with disabilities to access the Certificate examinations. For example enlarged print, Braille translation, modified questions, use of a scribe, a reader, a personal assistant, a tape recorder or word processor, may be allowed depending on needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">The scheme was expanded in 2000 following the report of an Expert Advisory Group, to provide opportunities for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment. In keeping with the advice of the Expert Advisory Group, a system of annotation was applied to any case where a student was exempt from a core area of assessment, or where the mode of assessment used had the same effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">This change, for example, enabled a hearing impaired student to be exempt for the first time from the aural component of language subjects. His/her marks on the balance of the examination would be grossed up proportionately towards 100%, and the certificate would include a note to the effect that all elements of the subject were assessed except the aural component. Spelling and grammar waivers in language subjects were provided to cater for students with dyslexia on a similar basis, with annotation of the certificates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">The aim of these changes was to facilitate the operation of a responsive and flexible system which enables all candidates to demonstrate their achievements, while preserving the integrity and fairness of the exams by ensuring that special arrangements are operated in a transparent manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">The introduction of the expanded scheme was seen as important in widening access and promoting the optimum participation for students with disabilities.  Since then the number of students availing of accommodations in the certificate examinations has grown dramatically. 4,438 accommodations were granted in 2002, including 39 component exemptions and 1,945 spelling and grammar waivers. By 2006, this number had increased to 12,136 accommodations, including 987 component exemptions, and 5,450 spelling and grammar waivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">An annotation only applies where a core element of assessment in a particular subject is not assessed. This is used to ensure fairness and integrity vis a vis other students who have been assessed in these components, and in order not to mislead the end user of the certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">In relation to the Equality Tribunal's recent findings, the legal position is that they must either be implemented in full or appealed within the specified timeframe under the Equal Status Act 2002. My Department has examined the findings and is concerned both that the widening of access through the use if exemptions coupled with annotations has not been fully understood in this case and that the fundamental nature of the accommodations being provided has been questioned. It has therefore been decided to appeal the findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">I have also asked the State Examinations Commission to re-examine policy and practice in this area. I am determined to ensure that our system continues to evolve in line with best practice, promoting high standards of quality and integrity, while ensuring access, participation and benefit for all our students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">Given that this case is to be appealed to the Circuit Court, it is not appropriate that I make any further comment in the matter.</p>

        [40936/06]

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1808">The Deputy will be aware that the staffing schedule for primary schools is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 28 pupils. Posts allocated on the basis of this schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a Principal, 23 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 627 pupils on 30th September, 2005. However, the enrolment figure submitted by the Board of Management for the 30th September, 2006 is 686 pupils. On the basis of that figure, the school was granted 2 Developing School Posts for the 2006/07 school year, bringing to 25 the number of mainstream class teachers. The school also has 4 Permanent Learning Support/Resource teachers, 1 Temporary Resource Teacher for Travellers and 3 Temporary Language Support Teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. The number of children in large classes has been significantly reduced. When this Government first came into office, there were more than 52,000 children in classes of 35 and over — five times the number that there were in the last school year. There were also more than 1,900 children in classes of 40 and over — compared to just over 200 in 05/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved. In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago and this was only right. If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now. But we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most. I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06. This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1824">I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 to 156, inclusive, and 166 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">My Department's preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">The Deputy may be familiar with the variety of current provision in this regard, which includes pre-school classes for children with autism, special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools, special classes for Asperger's syndrome plus a range of supports for pupils with autism integrated in mainstream classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">My Department also funds a pilot scheme for 12 centres where ABA is the exclusive approach.  Sanction has been given for 14 centres under the scheme and two have yet to open.  The Saplings centre referred to by the Deputy is funded under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">My Department's Inspectorate carried out an Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD)   This inspectorate report describes an evaluation of the education that is provided for children with ASD in a variety of settings nationwide. The elements of good practice identified during the evaluation process and in the literature review form the basis for the report's recommendations which will make a positive contribution to policy development and to the continuing improvement in the quality of education that is available to children with ASD including the future of the pilot scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">My Department supports the training and professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in 2003. The service as appropriate, consolidates co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings. Generally this support is provided by direct training input or sanction for school staff to attend courses recognised and funded through the SESS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas, one of which is Autism. This training will be delivered locally through the Education Centre network and/or through whole-staff in-school support. School Authorities will continue to work with parents to ensure a consistent home/school approach to the education of children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">While funding had been previously been made available to parents to attend certain courses on an ad hoc basis, my Department is currently reviewing its position in this regard and a decision in relation to future funding of parental courses will be considered in the context of this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">I wish to advise the Deputy that responsibility for the provision of occupational therapy services rests with the Health Service Executive.</p>

            <p eId="para_1834">The Special Education Support Service (SESS), which was established in September 2003.  This service consolidates, co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings.  These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">As part of this work, the SESS provides training in a number of specialised areas such as Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">Currently, the SESS is giving priority to mainstream schools with Autism Units and Autism Classes in Special Schools for training in PECS.  However, under the SESS Local Initiatives Scheme all teachers in schools can apply for funding to attend a PECS course.  Under the terms of this scheme schools and /or individual teachers request assistance to the SESS for identified professional development needs in relation to special education.  Support from the SESS can be financial, professional and/or advisory in nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">The SESS are funding places on a PECS course in Dublin on December 5th and 6th next. Schools with Autism Units/Classes in the Dublin/Kildare area have been offered places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">The Educate Together School in Newbridge, Co. Kildare has not made an application for training in the PECS concept of teaching.  However, the school should be advised that application forms are available on the SESS website (<i>www.sess.ie</i>) or through direct contact with SESS at 1850 200 884 or by e-mail at info@sess.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_1840">The ICT in Schools Programme commenced in 1998 following the publication of Schools IT2000.  The objective of the Programme is to ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to acquire the necessary skills for participation in the Information Society.  By the end of last year, over €170m was invested in the Programme since its commencement including some €114m in Capital supports to schools for the purchase of ICT equipment and the provision of internal computer networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">The information sought by the Deputy in relation to County Meath is not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">The major focus for my Department under the ICT in Schools Programme at the moment is the roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools.  This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three year €18m joint Government/ IBEC — TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Fund to provide local connectivity at school level.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering.  A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.  The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of €30m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">I am aware of the benefits that good use of ICT can bring to our children's education and will bear this in mind in considering what areas should be the future priorities for the ICT in Schools Programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1847">I can assure the Deputy that my Department fully recognises the crucial role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve sporting facilities and in particular, indoor facilities.  This Government is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment. Since 1997, great advances have been made in transforming school accommodation throughout the country, through an investment of €3 billion.  This has funded over 7,800 individual school projects in the last seven years alone.  Major capital projects at both primary and second level schools include the provision of adequate sporting facilities, providing that the site is of sufficient size — or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built.  This extends to the provision of both PE halls/GP areas and the provision of hard play areas and where site conditions allow playing pitches.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">A comprehensive equipment schedule is included in the funding package for such facilities, ranging from table-tennis sets to netball and indoor soccer equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this month I announced a special €6.5m package for primary schools to renew PE equipment.  This funding has issued to all 3,200 primary schools.  Under the package, every school received €2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment in their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, and will mean that schools can replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.  The modern equipment which can be purchased will help facilitate PE and sporting activities in schools, which everyone recognises is a very important aspect of school life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">This funding package is being made as part of this Government's continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country.  I expect to announce a PE equipment grant for post-primary schools in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to all primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">I would, however, point out that schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €145.58 with effect from 1st January, 2006.  From 1st January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 per pupil bringing the overall capitation grant per pupil at primary level to €163.58.  This will represent an increase of 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">Second-level schools have also benefited from substantial increases in funding for their day-to-day costs. The standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at €298 per pupil and the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil in 2006.  From 1 January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 to €316 per pupil. In addition, for voluntary secondary schools the support services grant will be increased by €30 per student, which includes a further equalisation measure, to €189 per pupil.  This aggregate increase of €48 per pupil will bring the cumulative increase in the per capita and support services grants for voluntary schools since 2003 to €112 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">Major capital projects at both primary and second level schools require the provision of adequate car parking facilities as part of the building project, providing that the site is of sufficient size — or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">In general, individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care, including traffic management measures.  My Department is prepared to consider applications from school authorities for grant-aid towards improving safety arrangements, including car parking, inside the vested area of the school, but would require that the integrity of the outdoor play area be safeguarded in so far as is possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that, particularly in urban areas where the size of school site may be limited, it may not be possible to adequately facilitate both playing facilities and car parking to the extent that it can be done with a larger site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">Issues relating to traffic safety, pay car parking etc. outside of school grounds are the responsibility of the relevant Local Authority.  Grant-aid is not available for works outside the vested area of the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1862">I understand that a letter was received in my office from the person referred to by the Deputy regarding the format of the Leaving Certificate Examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and issuing the results of examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">The issues raised in the correspondence relate to the need for a spread of assessment points, undue demand on students in the June examinations, and the scope for earlier results and repeat examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">A range of components in the Leaving Certificate examinations already take place prior to June.  For example, course work in Home Economics Scientific and Social is required to be completed by November.  The Engineering project is required to be completed in March.  The oral examinations are completed in April, in addition to the LCVP Link Modules portfolio, the practical course work elements of Religion, History and Geography, Agricultural Science, and Agricultural Economics, elective course work in Home Economics, the practical component of Music and the Construction Studies Project.  The practical examination in Engineering, Construction, Art and the elective in composing in Music take place in May as well as the written examination for the LCVP Link Modules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">The Leaving Certificate Applied programme also provides for completion of assessment components throughout the cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">I am acutely aware of the importance of ensuring a spread of assessment points, and of the need to move away from the heavy demand placed on students in the June terminal examinations.  I have asked the State Examinations Commission to discuss this issue with the partners in education to see how it might best be addressed.  The issue is also being progressed in the context of the reforms proposed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in regard to subjects in senior cycle.  These will provide for the embedding of key skills, a strengthening of ICT, practical project and portfolio work, and the inclusion of a second assessment component in subjects where this does not exist at present, providing for a spread of assessment points.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">I have been advised that there is little scope for the earlier issue of results or for repeat examinations given the scale of the Leaving Certificate and the nature of the examinations which are centrally set and externally marked.  There were over 54,000 candidates in the 2006 Leaving Certificate examinations.  The Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations combined involve over 114,000 candidates, almost 1 million grades and 2 million test items.</p>

There can be no doubt that at this early stage in the current school year, pupils have adequate notice to obtain placements in their own catchment areas for the 2007-2008 school year.

            <p eId="para_1968">Certain provisions of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 may be extended, by regulations, to other species of domesticated animals, including cats.  In the absence of reliable data regarding the number of wild or feral cats, and of appropriate solutions, it is not proposed to place an additional responsibility on local authorities that might dilute their control efforts in relation to dangerous and stray dogs which are generally viewed as presenting greater problems than feral cats.  However, where a local authority considers it appropriate it may assist a body which is endeavouring to reduce, in a humane manner, the problems caused by feral cats.  I understand that a number of local authorities have provided assistance to such bodies in recent years.</p>
