          <p eId="para_1">Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with four different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.

In view of the importance of the issue I hope you will agree to it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_232">Debate in this House and elsewhere in recent weeks and months on the current situation in Iraq has provoked strong words and much passion. From my perspective, I regret that balance and a sense of proper context has been lacking in many of the contributions. I therefore welcome the statement made yesterday evening by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen, as restoring some balance to the exchanges that have occurred on this matter, particularly regarding the use of Shannon Airport by foreign military aircraft and personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Undoubtedly, responsibility for the current crisis over Iraq lies with the Iraqi authorities and with Saddam Hussein in particular. The means to resolve it also lies with Saddam's regime and in full and genuine Iraqi compliance with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. It is not enough to pay lip service to the wholly legitimate requests of the weapons inspectors. There must be complete and active provision of all necessary information in order that trust can be built and confidence restored. International peace and security demands no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security lies with the UN Security Council. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has outlined the lengths to which Ireland has gone over the years in our support for the Security Council, for multilateralism and international law. I fully endorse his remarks in this regard and I particularly reiterate the points made by the Minister concerning Ireland's responsibilities and obligations under the UN Charter. The entire UN framework is designed towards the promotion of peace and stability between nations, but it is not a pacifist organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">A clear onus exists upon all countries to use whatever influence they have in support of the UN's primary objectives. In our case, Ireland has availed of every opportunity to do so which has presented itself at all levels of the United Nations and in our contacts with EU and US counterparts. That might not meet the demands of some who wish to see us engage in public denunciations and criticisms, particularly of the US foreign policy approach. However, I ask proponents of such actions in turn to specify what they think would be achieved as a result and how they would address the threat posed by Saddam and his regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">That threat has been well documented, most recently in the report by Dr. Blix and his colleagues. As the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has pointed out, no less an authority than the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has confirmed that in this instance the pressure placed upon Saddam has been effective and that without that pressure the weapons inspectors would not be back in Iraq today.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">It is in this context and in acknowledgement of its international responsibilities that the Government has permitted the use of Shannon Airport as a refuelling point for US aircraft and service personnel. However, we must also view these arrangements in the context of the long-standing friendly relations which have existed between Ireland and the US and the fact that the arrangements in question have been in place for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Nothing new is happening here and as a representative for the region, I point out that these arrangements have been good for Shannon over the years. Not least is the consideration that they have helped to maintain employment and contributed to the ongoing viability of the airport. I do not mean to imply that commercial significance should be the only yardstick by which we should judge these matters, but it is an important factor nevertheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">As regards security considerations, I welcome the announcement that security is to be upgraded at the airport. Employees at Shannon and residents living in the area are entitled to know that these matters are being properly addressed. At the same time, I hope that commentators on all sides, especially those who are critical of the Government's approach and the media in general, refrain from comments whose only effect is to create fear and uncertainty among the employees and local population. As the Government has made clear, it is unfair and disingenuous to claim that large quantities of heavy armaments and dangerous material are being transported through Shannon.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">While I acknowledge and fully share the hope conflict in the Gulf region can be avoided, it is important that the entire issue is considered in its proper context. The Government has not been a cheerleader for war, despite what some would have us believe. It has been serious and balanced in its approach and forthcoming in its commitment to allow for further debate on all aspects of the unfolding situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">In the meantime, Ireland is to the forefront in assisting the search for peace and has been clear in its position that the weapons inspectors should be given as much time as is proper to complete their work. Inspections cannot and should not go on indefinitely. However, it should be for the Security Council to determine the international community's next steps. Quite rightly, the Government and its EU partners are doing all they can to ensure these next steps are peaceful, but as I have already stated, key responsibility in this matter lies with Iraq. We all hope it lives up to this responsibility.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_245">The Government's position is that war in this situation is a last resort. War represents a failure of diplomacy. It is the earnest hope of the Government a peaceful solution can still be found, even at this late stage. It is also its position that it does not agree unilateral military action should be taken by the United States in the absence of a further UN resolution authorising such action. In the event of further military action being taken by the United States, with or without such a resolution, the Government will review the current arrangements at Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">This is a neutral country. Historically, we have been militarily neutral. That is still the position. The essential definition of "military neutrality" is that one is not part of a military alliance and does not take part in any foreign military adventures. As I have said, that has been and remains the position. However, some interpret "military neutrality" to mean we should be politically neutered as a country. Everyone in this country, from the humblest citizen, has a right to take a position and have an opinion on the great issues of the day, particularly the current impasse between the United States and Iraq. People have opinions which they are not afraid to express.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">On the current dispute between the United States and Iraq, I am unashamedly on the side of the United States which is led by people who are human, even though they may be flawed. It is a democracy with many failings and flaws. However, to put it and the United Nations on one side and the bloodstained dictatorship of Iraq on the other, I am unashamedly on the side of the United States. I believe I speak for the vast majority of people throughout the country when I say this. While saying I am on the side of the United States, I am not an uncritical, unthinking, cap-touching admirer of the United States. I do not admire all it has done and is doing. I think what happened in Kyoto was a disgrace. I do not understand its foreign policy in Korea, which can be best summarised as a mixture of bluster and appeasement. I do not agree with it taking a position between Iran and Iraq, and giving Iraq the weapons of mass destruction and the capacity to create such weapons of which they are now proposing to disarm them. Having said that, I will not go down the road of blind virulent unthinking anti-Americanism which puts people in the White House, however flawed, almost on the same moral plain as the butcher of Baghdad, causes people almost to make excuses for the barbarism of Saddam Hussein, the malevolence of al-Qaeda or the sheer evil of the Taliban.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Whatever one might think about America, it has been a force for good in the world. Without it, Europe would still be under the shadow of al-Qaeda, lurking equipped and supported in its Afghan lair and Saddam Hussein would now be sitting in the oilfields of Kuwait, and probably Saudi Arabia, armed to the teeth with all sorts of weapons of mass destruction which he would make readily available to every terrorist organisation which needed them. Would the Good Friday Agreement be in place without the United States? We know the answer to that question. Without the United States, how many Muslims, whom they are supposed to want to destroy, would be dead in Bosnia today?</p>
          <p eId="para_249">In regard to Shannon Airport, as I understand it, nothing has changed, bar one exception to which I will refer. What is happening at Shannon Airport today is what has been taking place since its inception. The regulations were stated by the Minister last night. Clearly, they are the same regulations that have been in place since the airport was founded. It is a little known fact that during the Cuban missile crisis of 1961 Soviet troops, troops of that evil empire of the Soviet Union, on their way to Cuba to assist in firing nuclear missiles at the United States, were allowed to refuel at Shannon Airport without let or hindrance. I doubt if they were acting under a UN mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">What has changed is that the Deputy Cowen is the first Minister for Foreign Affairs in the history of the State to have tightened up the regulations. The term "munitions of war" on civilian aircraft carriers was interpreted by the United States as not including personal side arms. I can understand how it would be interpreted in that way but the Minister has now made it clear that it includes personal side arms for which permission must be sought. Under the Defence Act, 1954, the Americans did not bother to get permission to step off. Even though they did not go through immigration, they stayed in the transit area while the aeroplane was being refuelled. The Minister has now made it clear that they must get permission to wear uniforms while in the transit lounge.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I recall between 1992 and 1997 when the Labour Party was part of the Government and Deputy Michael D. Higgins was a Minister, not once but on several occasions, going to Shannon Airport and witnessing the spectacle of United States troops in full military uniform in the transit lounge going off to God knows what military adventure. I wonder where was that latent volcano of pacifism lying dormant in Deputy Michael D. Higgins's breast at the time? What prevented him from coming flying to the boil? Was it the trappings of office or am I too cynical to imagine this? When some reach a certain age, they have a faith lift. Obviously, Deputy Higgins has decided to have one.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Ireland and America are tied by ties of blood and friendship, as the Minister pointed out last night. Deputy Pat Breen articulated the local situation in Shannon very well last night when he pointed out that American investment accounts for 60% of investment in the Shannon region. It accounts for tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of jobs, throughout the country. In the past we have often called on America for assistance and it has always answered the call. The Good Friday Agreement would not be in place but for the United States which has helped us in several other ways. What will we achieve if we prevent the Americans from using the facilities at Shannon Airport? We will inconvenience it by all of 20 minutes while they travel to Prestwick Airport in Scotland where they will be received with open arms.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Are we prepared to turn our backs on all the American assistance we have received in the past, the American assistance we will need in the future and give the two fingers to American investment in this country? In other words, are we prepared to cut off our nose to spite our face for one day's headlines while the Americans are slightly inconvenienced? Who will replace the jobs that will be lost through lack of American investment and assistance? Deputy Joe Higgins will not give jobs to my constituents employed in Shannon and who are totally on the side of the Americans. Perhaps he will get his friend, Kim, the beloved father of the people of North Korea, to come and give them jobs. That is the reality on the ground. It is what the workers – Deputy Higgins purports to represent the working class – in Limerick and Shannon are saying to me.</p>

No one in this country will have blood on their hands if America goes to war with Iraq. We did not create the impasse between America and Iraq and can do nothing to stop it. If we refuse the Americans the right to refuel, it will not stop the war in Iraq. I do not doubt the sincerity of those who are protesting peacefully in Shannon at present. While I do not condone criminal damage, I admire the fact that they are so sincere. If anybody has questions to answer about this matter, it is those whose actions and comments are encouraging Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad, who believes that he can continue to get away with flouting UN sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">If one was to listen to some of the speakers opposite without knowing the history of Shannon Airport since the 1950s, one could be convinced that the idea of military aircraft flying into Shannon was a new one. It has been pointed out in this debate that military aircraft of various nationalities have been refuelling at Shannon for many decades. Speakers have explained that the practice, which has been going on for over 50 years under successive Governments, has brought a great deal of prosperity to the airport and to the mid-west region. It is nauseating to hear the Opposition ranting about the phenomenon as if it were a new one. The Government has improved the implementation of existing arrangements. The UN Security Council has been attempting to convince Iraq to disarm itself of its weapons of mass destruction for about 12 years, but a satisfactory response has yet to be received. Iraq has defied many UN resolutions. Would the UN inspectors be in Iraq without the credible threat of force?</p>

          <p eId="para_271">One only needs to have read last Tuesday's newspapers, which carried reports of what the UN chief weapons inspector, Dr. Hans Blix, said to the UN Security Council on Monday, to understand that UN inspectors are not receiving the co-operation they need if they are to carry out their work. Dr. Blix made clear that Iraq has not accepted its disarmament obligations and has failed to make a full disclosure of its biological and chemical weapons. He said that Iraq does not accept the UN's demands and that it has failed to account for 6,500 chemical bombs. There are strong indications, according to Dr. Blix, that Iraq has produced more anthrax than it has declared and that it has weaponised the chemical weapon VX. It is clear that Baghdad has not actively co-operated with the UN inspectors to the degree that is required and it is hoped that it will use the extra time it has been given to comply, as nobody wants war. The best way to avoid war is for Iraq to co-operate with the inspectors. It has two weeks to comply with the UN resolution and it must do so, for everyone's sake.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">We should not have to contemplate the horrific human consequences of war and its destabilising global effects. The Government and the people want a resolution through peaceful means. Although Ireland is a neutral country, we should not bury our heads in the sand. We should contribute to the international debate by bringing to it views that are free, fair and unencumbered. Mr. John. F. Kennedy referred to Irish neutrality in his address to this House almost 40 years ago, a speech from which I have quoted on previous occasions. Mr. Kennedy said, "Ireland is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be."  Ireland holds such a stance in relation to Iraq – the Government has tried in every forum available to it to raise a temperate voice in trying to avoid and avert conflict. International peace, justice, security and stability are the planks of our foreign policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said last night that the UN is "the centre of this system of collective security". He said that any defiance of the lawful decisions of the Security Council represents a challenge to the legitimacy of international order. It is important to remember that membership of the United Nations carries obligations and responsibilities. If Iraq fails to meet the conditions of the UN resolution, the Security Council will meet to decide on the further steps that may be necessary. The Taoiseach said yesterday that Ireland would have to reconsider the position in relation to Shannon Airport if unilateral action were taken by the US, the UK, or a combination of the US and the UK, in the absence of a UN resolution, in circumstances where the UN has not debated or agreed a resolution, or if there was no Security Council mandate for such action. The Government and the House would have to be consulted before a decision could be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">As a representative of County Clare, I am aware of the ties between the Shannon region and the United States, not only in historical terms but also in terms of the present-day economic reality. Some 541 US companies employ almost 89,000 Irish people in Ireland. US investment has played a major part in Irish economic recovery and is an essential part of the lives of many in the mid-west. Those who live in the area appreciate the value of the international airport and would like to see further security measures put in place there. The Minister for Foreign Affairs acknowledged the latter request last night in the House. Deputies on all sides of the House fervently hope that wise counsel will prevail and that war will be averted.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">I vigorously support the amendment tabled by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, last night and the position of the Government as outlined by him. Our position is reasonable, responsible and logical on foot of our position as members of the United Nations and in view of the complex nature of the issues under consideration. I welcome the fact that the Minister has clearly outlined the details of the arrangements in place for the use of Shannon Airport and I commend him for his considered and measured management of this intricate and evolving situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Many of my constituents are mystified by the sudden interest in Shannon Airport on the part of those who were absent when their support would have been appreciated. They are equally amazed that politicians and others have suddenly discovered that the airport has been used for decades by US and other military aircraft. The vast majority of my constituents who have contacted me support the use of Shannon Airport by the UN military, subject to the current arrangements and conditions. They are also aware that military aircraft from 35 countries landed at Shannon last year. As the Minister has indicated, the procedures that set down the conditions for the use of Shannon Airport are strongly rooted in legislation and long-standing policy. We should acknowledge the role and the professionalism of the Shannon Airport workforce in attracting such business.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Deputies from County Clare frequently come into contact with asylum seekers and refugees, including Iraqi people, some of whom I know personally, as a consequence of the fact that Shannon Airport is in our constituency. I wish that some of those who oppose the pressure that is being placed on Saddam Hussein could meet the Iraqi refugees in Clare to hear about their experiences and those of the members of their families who have survived the brutal regime. Similarly, many people will have been impressed by the Iraqi man who spoke on this week's "Questions and Answers". Under the Hussein regime, Iraq poses a threat to international peace and security. Ireland has certain obligations under UN resolutions – we are aware of the indiscriminate nature of terrorism – and there is no argument for not facing up to our responsibilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">The Labour Party supports the broad thrust of the motion moved by Deputy Gregory last night, although it does not necessarily agree with everything in it. I am surprised that the motion does not call on Iraq to comply with UN Security Council resolutions, but we will support it nonetheless. My party has stated its opposition to any US-led war with Iraq, especially as the UN inspectors have yet to complete their report and there is no Security Council resolution to that effect. In such circumstances, a massive conflict with potentially serious loss of life is unwarranted, unjust and against the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Ireland, Europe and the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The motivation behind US military action against Iraq without the express consent of the Security Council must be questioned. The US suffered an unimaginable tragedy when attacked by Osama bin Laden on 11 September 2001. We were told that the ultimate goals of the response to 11 September were to be regime change in Afghanistan and bringing bin Laden to justice. Despite the fact that these objectives were unfulfilled, the focus of the US Administration switched to confronting what it defined as an "axis of evil". Any military action, therefore, is on the United States' terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Saddam Hussein is an evil and brutal dictator, as demonstrated by his use of chemical weapons in 1988. He was responsible for the most heinous acts against his own people and he has been punished by the international community for that. Since the 1991 Gulf War his position has been seriously undermined by policies of containment advanced by European leaders and the crippling sanctions imposed by the United States. However, the proposed military action by the United States and its allies contradicts international law. There is no evidence that this would be a just war. Nor will it necessarily be in response to a direct attack on US targets by Iraq. Unilateral regime change through military means is an unacceptable policy response and any country advocating it departs from international law and any pretence of being interested in workable solutions to the world's problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The United Nations has not produced any resolutions advocating military action. Without this mandate, war cannot be supported. Under UN Resolution 1284, weapons inspectors were given a mandate to monitor and verify Iraq's military capabilities. Despite the wide range of powers the resolution granted to the inspectors, intense British and American pressure led to the Security Council's adoption of Resolution 1441, under which the inspectors currently operate. The inspectors, however, have been reported as saying their current efforts are being undermined: the USA and the United Kingdom seem to have already opted for war. Their update of 27 January 2003, presented to the Security Council, advocated giving Iraq one last chance before even considering war. It is essential that the inspectors are given all the time necessary to discharge their mandate fully. This request has been backed by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and the German Government, which currently holds the Presidency of the Security Council. Dr. Blix has welcomed US offers to provide intelligence on Iraq's weapons in order that the inspectors may complete their task as soon as possible. He recognises that Iraq still has many questions to answer, but it is unlikely that Saddam Hussein will reveal his full military capability while the threat of war is present.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">In more than two months of work the inspectors have found no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. In addition, Dr. Blix told the Security Council that, on the whole, Iraq had co-operated rather well. While some of the criticism of the Iraqi authorities made by him is significant and while pressure must continue to be exerted on Baghdad to co-operate in all respects, these certainly do not constitute grounds for war. The UN inspection regime has proven effective in the past. It should be remembered that between 1991 and 1998 UN inspections detected and secured the destruction of far more weapons than were destroyed either in the Gulf War or in the subsequent and largely unpublicised bombing campaign by US and UK forces, which is still ongoing. The extent of the US military build-up gives rise to the suspicion that the United States will proceed with military action regardless of the findings of the inspectors and irrespective of whether any further military action is sanctioned by the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">In his State of the Union address on Tuesday night President Bush appeared contemptuous of the pre-eminence of the Security Council and the United Nations. He said the United States would "consult," but that "if Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm . . .  we will lead a coalition to disarm him."  Such comments fall just short of declaring war, as little time is available for assembling this coalition. Meanwhile, the Government has continued to grant facilities at Shannon Airport to the United States, as it is entitled to give to any country during peacetime. The Labour Party sought a full debate on this matter to discuss the facilities that had been made available to the US military. The Taoiseach, however, has given only one and a half hours for statements from party leaders – a wholly inadequate response to our request. Specifically, we requested that the Taoiseach outline steps that had been taken to enforce section 317 of the Defence Act, 1954, which explicitly states: "No person shall, save with the consent in writing of a Minister of State, enter or land in the State while wearing any foreign uniform".</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Should the United States proceed with military action without a UN mandate, what will be the Government's position on the use of Shannon Airport by a country involved in an illegal war? The Taoiseach faces bitter public opposition to the US presence in these circumstances and should declare clearly where the Government stands. His comments in the Dáil that in such circumstances the Government would review this policy is a complete abdication of responsibility. People are extremely concerned about precisely what is happening at Shannon Airport and what our part is in the military build-up. The Taoiseach has continually dodged these questions. Is it that he has no answer? Is it that he is not prepared to confront reality? Thus far, Ireland's role has been one of silent spectator as we drift towards war. There is much more that could be done to avert a war. This country should be mobilising international support for efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has just returned from Iraq and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will come into the House to hear what he has to say. He went there seeking to listen and understand the situation in the Gulf. I see no such effort from the Taoiseach or senior members of the Government to engage in this manner. The Government's silence on the threat of war and the use of Shannon Airport by the US military is in stark contrast to pronouncements from the German Chancellor, Mr. Schröder, and the French President, Mr. Chirac. Despite being prominent and influential members of NATO, they have stated they will do all they can to avert war. We are committed constitutionally to military neutrality, yet the Government has still to make a clear and unambiguous statement on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">We do not see what we should be seeing: a Government committed to using its power, politically and diplomatically, to exert pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply with all relevant UN resolutions. It should implement some means of inspecting the US aircraft at Shannon Airport rather than passively hiding behind muddled statements from Cabinet Ministers who seem to be totally confused about what is happening and what the Government's position is. Moreover, it needs to show a certain independence of spirit and join all the other countries trying to do their very best to prevent an illegitimate war, rather than acting as a conduit for a devastating conflict.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">War is the oldest solution to conflict. Since time began, we have been using it as a method of solving differences. It is the most unsuccessful solution, yet we continue to use it. Nobody has stood up and said Saddam Hussein is someone who must remain in power – we are all agreed on that. Deputy Killeen, who represents the Shannon area, said if those of us who were protesting at Shannon Airport had met Iraqis who had been forced out of their own country by a brutal dictatorship, we would have a different opinion. I know Iraqis. I know people who have fled the country between life and death and were lucky to get out. They are extremely concerned about the other members of their families who were not as fortunate as them. Not alone must they live with the sanctions already imposed, worried in case their children get sick and there is no medication available, they now also have the additional worry of being bombed in their beds because America has decided – whether because of oil or the next election – that it is going to war.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Nobody was under any illusion about how long the stopover in Shannon Airport had been provided for and what its function was. What is happening now, however, is that Ireland, a militarily neutral country, is allowing vehicles to refuel in order to continue on a journey to amass for war. That is an entirely different situation. It defies logic that the Taoiseach, who is prepared to intervene in a dispute between a soccer manager and a player, has no opinion on what Ireland should do in relation to allowing military aircraft to refuel at Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Those of us who are opposed to this war, as every right-thinking person should be, are not saying we are against the American people. All the research shows that the majority of American people do not want the war either. George W. Bush has decided he has found his niche in life which is to tell the rest of us that if we do not behave, he has the might and he is prepared to use it. There are only two groups of people who should be asked about whether one should go to war, those who have been there before and mothers. The former know its devastation and awfulness and the latter are not prepared to risk their children. If I was an average citizen in Iraq, I would pray, to whatever God I pray to, that Ireland would take a stand to try to seek an alternative to what now appears inevitable. There must be an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I am equally convinced that if George W. Bush and his Executive thought that there would be any resistance, they would rethink this war because it is about ensuring he is re-elected. It worries me that he is prepared to make such an enormous sacrifice to continue in power because power is never worth such sacrifice. I appeal to the Government to rethink its position in relation to refuelling at Shannon. The Government, which prides itself on being in touch with the ordinary person, particularly the Taoiseach, a man of the people, clued in to what people think, should ask people what they think and find an alternative solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">I refute the accusations of being anti-American which have been fired across the floor of this House and outside it. It is a false and dishonest argument which seeks to divert attention away from the real issue. As my colleague, Deputy Lynch, who was on the march with me in Shannon, said, it is not about being anti-American. As far as we can tell, public opinion in the United States is sizeably against this war. Many political leaders are against the war and the Democratic Party has questioned George W. Bush, indicating they have serious concerns as to why the US Government wants to go to war now rather than go through UN channels.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Large demonstrations in the US indicate the level of public opinion against the war. Americans remember the recent hit against them on 11 September 2001 as well as the Vietnam war and its consequences for them. I listened to an interview on "Today with Pat Kenny" yesterday with the "Gabby Cabby", Mr. Franklin, who is a sounding board for public opinion in New York city. His anecdotal information from driving around New York city was that the large majority of US public opinion does not want it to go to war. To suggest we are being anti-American is entirely false and disingenuous and the notion should be put to bed once and for all. On the peace march in Shannon was a group describing itself as American citizens living in Ireland against the war. These Americans are willing to come out and campaign against the war.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">It is right that we, as a friendly country, speak out when we see that the US appears to want to go against international law by taking it upon itself to go to war without the sanction of the UN. World opinion in various countries, particularly France and Germany, supports that view. The weapons inspectors have looked for more time. They said if they had more time they could continue effectively with the job they have been given. There is no logical reason any Government should pre-empt the work of the weapons inspectors. Dr. Mohamed El Baradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency indicated that a few more months were required.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">In the meantime, troops have been travelling through Shannon Airport. The figures we were given yesterday were that 19 flights in the past ten days carried munitions but many others probably did before that of which we were not aware. I was in the airport some weeks ago and saw troops there. Many people I know who have been through the airport have also seen them so there are obviously huge numbers passing through the region in which I live, comprising an integral part of the build-up to war.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">One of the arguments for why we might have war sooner rather than later is that there are 250,000 troops in the Gulf region and they cannot hang around indefinitely waiting for action. Surely that is totally immoral, just as it is for Ireland to have been an integral part of that preparation for war. The Taoiseach is not willing to state categorically if he will stop the use of Shannon if the US goes it alone without the backing of the UN. Rather he says we will have a debate on the matter in the Dáil. That is immoral and runs against our law and constitutional neutrality. It beggars belief that the Taoiseach says we will have a debate when the time comes. The Government should be able to say categorically that if the US goes to war without the backing of the UN against international law, it will not allow our airports to be used. I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister of State who is here representing the Government to make that clear because, as someone who lives in and represents the region, I believe it is not good enough that the Government is not clear on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">If the US goes to war, it will kill many people, create total instability in a region that already has its fair share and have a major effect around the world. There is no evidence to suggest it will change the regime in Iraq, that it will produce weapons or have a positive effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I watched a programme on TG4 last night about Afghanistan and the after-effects of the attacks on that country. The people said they still had to grow and export the opium that makes illegal drugs because no one has helped them in terms of infrastructure or other supports. The evidence suggests that after the US has got what it wants from attacking Iraq, it will continue looking after its own interests and the people of Iraq will be left to sort out the mess that is left behind.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">The Green Party is strongly of the view that this motion should be passed in Dáil Éireann today and acted upon accordingly. This morning I sought to raise, by way of Standing Order 31, that the Dáil be adjourned to clarify the veracity of the perception by the United States Embassy in Ireland that US citizens here are living under a threat of terrorism sufficiently large to warrant the need to be prepared to leave Ireland at short notice. I asked if the Government intends to issue a similar briefing to Irish citizens. We need to debate the matter. If it is an issue serious enough for the US Embassy in Ireland, surely it is an issue which our Government should take responsibility for too. It is not a new scenario that is being discussed. On 14 January, a report in <i>The New York Times</i> from the Scott Air Force Base in Illinois stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Troops and weapons moving towards the Persian Gulf have come under threat of possible terrorist attack according to military officials, who say they are more alert than ever to the risks. In the past three weeks United States intelligence have gathered what officials have described as credible evidence of a planned bombing of a passenger airliner contracted to fly troops and freight for the military.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">A clear threat is being presented to the United States wherever it goes, and because Ireland is agreeing totally with the wishes of the United States in terms of refuelling at Shannon Airport we are subject to whatever threat the United States receives in that regard. Not only is our own population under threat, United States citizens in Ireland are also under threat, some of whom are working for the Green Party and also very aware of the need to halt this war.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The people of Iraq are already suffering, not just from this particular episode of the Gulf War but also from the first Gulf War. It is chilling to read an American publication about the rusting tanks gathered in Iraq's southern desert like an open air exhibit of the 1991 Gulf War. It states:</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The rusting tanks are gathered in Iraq's southern desert like an open-air exhibit of the 1991 Gulf War. But these are not just museum pieces. This still radioactive battlefield – and the severe health problems many Iraqis and some US Gulf War veterans ascribe to it – may also be an omen of an unsettled future.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">As American forces prepare to take on Iraq in a possible possible Gulf War II, analysts agree that the bad publicity and popular depleted uranium (DU) used in the first Gulf War, and later in Kosovo and Afghanistan, have not dented Pentagon enthusiasm for its "silver bullet." US forces in Iraq will again deploy DU as their most effective and most controversial tank-busting bullet.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">For a country which has lived for so long in the shadow of Sellafield we are showing complete inconsistency and a lack of moral courage by allowing the possibility of depleted uranium being used in another war in the Gulf. A message is being received internationally that Ireland will go along with this as long as everybody else does. We have a responsibility to face up to the reality that we are a neutral country founded on peaceful resolution of disputes, which we should now be asserting.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Taoiseach knows that the Constitution states clearly we need to consult Dáil Éireann on this matter before participating in a war. He also knows he cannot avoid this, yet it is clear that the United States believes it is at war with Iraq already, based on my having listened to Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush after 11 September 2001. A war is ongoing as far as they are concerned; it is just a matter of what shape it takes. We are infringing the Constitution by not having a vote on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I was going to say the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were behaving like Pontius Pilate on this matter, but it increasingly seems that they are like Lady Macbeth, washing their hands because of the blood.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I have the distinction of being the only Member of the Dáil to have been born in the United States, a distinction shared by the founder of the party opposite. It was a birthright that enabled him to be a founder member of that party. My birthright and the experience of my formative years help inform me of a view of America that is a little more complex than some of the glib simplifications we hear from many participating in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">America is a country with which we share a strong affinity in terms of our history and culture. Its people are open, dynamic and determined. I am able to make a distinction between that affinity and my regard for the American people and being able to oppose the Government which represents them and the policy it presents to the world. To be anti-war is not to be anti-American. To be against George Bush and his Administration is not to be anti-American. Unfortunately, the debate we have been having has been ignoring some of these simple truths.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Our historical and cultural relationship has developed even further in recent years. Our economic ties have grown stronger, involving 350 firms and almost 90,000 jobs. It has been suggested that these will be threatened by the nature and tone of the debate. However, I believe economic decisions made by American based multinationals are not informed by foreign policy but by the business sense that has enabled them to make profits worldwide. They are in this country because it makes economic sense for them to be here. Ireland provides access to a huge market and a workforce which is well educated and well motivated, and it enables such companies to take advantage of a very generous tax system, all of which will continue after this crisis has passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">We have to condemn strongly the operations of the American Administration. Unfortunately, the American people are being badly led, as are the people of this country. The people of America are being badly misled and dragged into a military conflict for motives that are less than pure, reasons that are far from explainable, and ends that are of questionable morality.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I am not afraid to bring morality into this debate. I do not equate for one second the maladministration of President Bush and his cronies with the tyranny of Mr. Hussein and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. However, I expect better from the world's biggest democracy. I expect the potential evident since the end of the Soviet Union and the existence of a world system with only one superpower to bring about a more peaceful world. A democracy should not have to resort to violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">In the aftermath of 11 September 2001 one of the French newspapers led with the headline, "We are all Americans now". While that headline was a piece of emotional hyperbole, a part of me will always be American. However, for me, to be American is to take a stand with the millions of Americans opposing the actions of their Government and bring about a world where the types of policies practised by this Administration cannot come into being.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">The world is gripped by the onrush of what is probably and may prove to be the greatest global crisis in more than 100 years. Large-scale preparations for conflict have been taking place for several months now, with two diametrically opposed mobilisations escalating over Iraq. Today's Private Members' motion may prove to be academic, with 250,000 US military personnel and 26,000 British troops in place on a global chess board with unlimited potential for disaster. Driven by their fear that global resistance will soon render war impossible, the chicken hawk architects of the war in both Washington and London have massively stepped up their deployment of troops and military equipment to those countries adjacent to Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Recently President Bush stated the course of the United States did not depend on the decision of others, including the United Nations, effectively placing himself and the United States outside the pale of the United Nations, whose moral authority he is happy to invoke as other occasions demand. The United States has treated Irish air navigation orders in cavalier fashion, as massive troop and munitions deployments openly flouted the regulations, particularly by transporting munitions of war without Government approval. By allowing through flights and extending the use of our airspace and facilities to the United States and by being tarred with the coalition brush, Ireland is being placed in dire risk of reprisals from misguided terror groups, whose ingenuity and imaginativeness in fomenting chaos and mass murder are legendary. Sellafield immediately comes to mind in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The failure of the UN arms inspectors may have unthinkable consequences and they should be given adequate time to complete their work, free from the shadow of the propaganda press. The latter is generating a pervasive climate of fear and predicting imminent biological and chemical warfare attacks by Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">As a verification and precautionary measure, I advocate the immediate establishment of an Irish arms and munitions inspectorate at Shannon Airport to ensure compliance with air navigation orders. Ireland must use its good offices as a UN Security Council member to build confidence in the negotiation process.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">In the current international crisis the conscience of the nation does not reside in Leinster House. Its conscience is very much in evidence at the peace camp at Shannon Airport and in the daily demonstrations and meetings which are taking place in this city. The conscience of the nation will also be in evidence on the streets of Dublin on Saturday, 15 February, when many thousands will join together in opposition to the threat of war by the United States Administration and the British Government against the peoples of Iraq. The conscience of the nation does not reside in the House, though many Members on these benches are determined in their opposition to the Government's destruction of our neutrality, and it certainly does not reside in the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Foreign Affairs. By their actions, the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs have written a new chapter of shame in Irish diplomatic history.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Government is systematically abandoning neutrality by stealth. It joined NATO's Partnership for Peace despite promises to the contrary, it has committed troops to the EU rapid reaction force and Deputy Cowen is now arguing for the extension of the Petersberg Tasks beyond humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. The Government refused to seek a legally binding neutrality protocol to the Nice treaty despite the public outcry on not one but two occasions. It set the precedent of ministerial authorisation of war preparations at Shannon Airport in the case of the USA-led war on Afghanistan without the assent of the Dáil and has failed to use its positions on the Security Council and in the EU to avert war on Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Listening to the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night was incredible. An instance of particular note was his statement that actions at Shannon Airport which brought attention to the compliance of this Government with US war needs would only invite the attention of potential terrorists. In other words, we should all shut up, ignore it and allow the Government to continue in its actions and complicity with US war intent, otherwise we could very well make Shannon Airport a target. It is not the peace camp campaigners or the Members of this House who would make Shannon Airport a target, it is the actions of this Government in its abrogation of its responsibility to uphold Irish neutrality and ensure the clearly stated intent of the people is upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The Government has allowed US forces to use Shannon Airport as a pit-stop on their way to their war build-up. It has refused to unequivocally reject participation in war on Iraq. The people are clearly opposed to this war and they value neutrality. The Government would undoubtedly have overwhelming support for an independent foreign policy and a neutrality which is both positive and proactive. It is not too late and I appeal at this eleventh hour to the Government to act in accordance with the wishes of the people. It should restore some sense of credibility with those who elected it and with Irish public opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">What does Irish complicity in this war mean? Are we aware of the costs of war, especially in human, economic and environmental terms? Given the suffering already inflicted on the people of Iraq by the sanctions, what is mass bombing going to bring to the citizens of that state? There has been over a decade of economic sanctions and their effectiveness is to be questioned. It is ironic that Britain and the USA, the two countries most opposed to sanctions against South Africa, were the ones pressing hardest at the outset of this campaign for the imposition of sanctions on Iraq. Those sanctions are not effective because they have not been thought through in the same way as those imposed on South Africa. Sanctions eliminated the need for war in South Africa, but the intention has always been war in the case of Iraq. It was always about money and oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">This House must clearly say "No" to war for oil and "No" to war for profits, even if those profits are for Irish industry. Although Ireland is not an arms exporting nation, many companies manufacture dual use components which can and probably will be used if this war goes ahead. We must highlight the real intent behind the war. Tony Blair last week justified his intentions by citing the hundreds of millions of pounds his Government was spending to move 25% of its total military personnel to the Gulf.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">This has not only recently become an issue and even before 11 September and the war in Afghanistan, the British Government was spending £23.5 billion annually on defence. That is what is behind current circumstances. It amounts to a very powerful lobby within the British economy. It is an industry which in time of war or peace diverts to armaments scarce resources which could be used to tackle issues such as child labour, illiteracy, global poverty and the massive health problems affecting billions of people throughout the world. It was the British and USA arms industries which supplied weapons to Saddam Hussein and fuelled ten years of war between Iran and Iraq. People remember the name of Oliver North and the vivid pictures of him standing before a House commission attempting to explain what went on and the filth behind the set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">In the Bush Administration, 32 presidential appointees have significant ties to the arms industry. That gives us some insight into the backdrop to what is happening. We know what is the position of the Irish people with regard to this matter. They are firmly in favour of neutrality as evidenced in debate on the first referendum on the Nice treaty and in any airing or discussion of the issue we have ever had. Unfortunately, we do not define our neutrality by stating what it is, rather we define it according to what it is not. We should take examples from documents such as the Hague treaty to instance positive elements of neutrality and we should conduct an open and frank debate about this country's desire for a properly neutral position. We should enshrine that position in our Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has already spoken at length with regard to this motion and I wish to emphasise the Government's concern over the crisis on Iraq. Not the least of these concerns is the continuing suffering of the Iraqi people under the sanctions regime. It is a matter of profound regret for the Government that the people of Iraq continue to suffer considerable hardship as a result of their Government's deliberate and persistent violation of successive United Nations Security Council resolutions aimed at preserving international peace and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Ireland has worked to ensure that United Nations sanctions are administered in such a way as to ensure that the humanitarian and long-term economic interests of the people of Iraq are secured, while also ensuring that the necessary controls are in place to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction. During its term on the Security Council, Ireland was active in developing Resolution 1409, adopted in May 2002, which seeks to target sanctions against the Iraqi regime while minimising the impact of those sanctions on the civilian population. In particular, the provisions of Resolution 1409 were intended to ensure that there would be continuing availability of medical supplies for the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population, including mothers and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">In addition to the work which it has done at the United Nations, the Government has also sought to assist the vulnerable sectors of Iraq's civilian population. In 2002, Ireland channelled funds through the Irish NGO, Trócaire, for an emergency programme targeting children and mothers in an emergency nutrition intervention. Ireland also provided approximately €467,500 in bilateral humanitarian assistance in 2001-02. The fact remains, however, that the most effective way of easing the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people and avoiding any escalation in the current situation would be for the Iraqi Government to act immediately to meet its obligations under the United Nations Charter by complying fully with the demands placed upon it by the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">From the outset, the sanctions regime imposed no restrictions on the importation of humanitarian supplies. With the adoption of the oil for food programme in 1996, Iraq was given a workable mechanism by which it could trade unlimited quantities of oil in exchange for humanitarian goods for its civilian population. The United Nations Secretary General has confirmed on a number of occasions that the improved funding level for the oil for food programme means that the Government of Iraq is in a position to address the nutritional and health needs of the Iraqi people, particularly those of children. The head of the Office of the Iraq Programme, Mr Benon Sevan, has repeatedly advised the Security Council, and visiting members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last November, of the obstacles which the Iraqi Government has put in the way of the effective operation of the programme. By withholding effective co-operation from the programme, through such means as politically motivated embargoes on oil sales and refusals to prioritise purchases under the programme, the Iraqi Administration has contributed in large part to the shortfalls in the provision of essential supplies to the Iraqi people.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Two day ago, the United Nations arms inspectors reported to the Security Council on the progress of their inspections. While Dr. Al Baradei was fairly positive and took the view that Iraq does not currently have any nuclear weapons programme, Dr. Blix, head of the main weapons inspection body, was far less positive and raised a number of serious concerns. Dr. Blix made it clear that the immediate, unconditional and active co-operation required by Resolution 1441 had not been forthcoming. There is a series of areas where Iraq's declaration on its weapons is incomplete or where it has failed to produce evidence to support its claims that it has destroyed weapons. So far, Iraq has failed to give a believable account of what it made, what it used and what has become of what it might still hold. It is time it did so. It is not the inspectors' job to search for evidence of Iraqi non-compliance, it is for the Iraqis to prove that they have done what they claim to have done. It is for them to set the record straight once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I agree with the suggestion that other countries, which claim to have evidence, should put it forward. All countries who can offer such evidence have a responsibility to do so. I am pleased to note that President Bush has announced that on 5 February, his Secretary of State will present such evidence to the Security Council. We await it with interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Earlier in this debate, Deputy Gregory claimed that Iraq no longer represents a military threat. He is much mistaken. The possibility that any state might possess chemical and biological weapons is a threat to us all and one which must be dealt with. A suspicion to this effect must be laid to rest as speedily as possible. The international community has long forbidden the possession, let alone the use of such weapons. The case is all the more pressing when the country under suspicion is known to have had chemical weapons in the past and actually used them, both against its neighbours and its own citizens. There is every reason to suspect Iraq of continuing possession of such weapons, every reason to fear that it might once again put them to use.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Ireland very much wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis. Military action is not a desirable solution, far from it. Force must be used only as a last resort when all other means have been exhausted. Recognising this, Ireland, together with our fellow members of the Security Council, worked hard to ensure the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441 on 8 November last. The resolution is designed to avert war. It brings the entire issue of the use of military force back within the framework of the United Nations and gives Iraq a final opportunity to demonstrate that it has rid itself of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as it is required to do by successive Security Council resolutions. If Iraq should fail to meet the conditions set by the resolution, the Security Council is to convene immediately to assess any alleged material breach of Iraq's obligations, to consider the situation arising and to decide upon further steps necessary to bring about full compliance with its resolutions.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_338">In the months before Resolution 1441 was adopted, there was a widespread expectation of unilateral use of force by the United States. Today, by contrast, the Security Council is dealing with the issue and efforts are being made to find a peaceful outcome. I have never accepted, nor do I now, that war is inevitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Although there is no definitive position of the international community on the arguments which the Unite States and others have advanced that no further resolution is required to mandate the use of force, we consider that there is an overriding political need for the Security Council to determine whether its resolutions have been breached and what measures should be adopted. If the situation arises where military action is initiated against Iraq, either with or without further Council sanction, the Government, as the Minister promised yesterday, will, having reviewed the situation, initiate a debate in this House on the position to be adopted by Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">If, despite all our efforts, a war cannot be averted, its consequences could be very grave. Apart from the terrible suffering to which the ordinary people of Iraq would be exposed, there would be a serious risk of destabilising an already volatile region. The sense of victimisation felt by many in the Moslem world would be deepened, support for terrorism could grow and economies would suffer. The Government does not wish to see war take place. In every forum available to us, we have spoken out and used our influence to urge the parties to find a peaceful solution and we will continue to pursue this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The basis for Ireland's approach to this crisis is our long-standing commitment to international peace, justice, security and stability upheld by the rule of law, peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights. These beliefs are also reflected in the concerns about the possibility of war which have been expressed by many people here in Ireland and abroad. I do not see this attitude as anti-American. The concerns reflect genuinely held beliefs, expressed freely and openly in countries where people have the opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Ireland strongly supports the system of collective international security, a system in which we see the United Nations as the keystone. The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the Council is acting on behalf of the entire membership of the United Nations. The system of collective international security can work only when individual countries accept their responsibilities. All states which desire a peaceful international order, ruled by principle rather than by force, have to stand up for the authority of the Security Council. Under Article 25 all members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Council. This is a clear obligation on all states.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Unfortunately, Iraq has consistently flouted its obligations. Everything in Iraq's record shows that the regime in Baghdad responds only to the threat of military action in the face of further non-compliance. For such a threat to be effective, it must be credible. It is through this perspective that we should consider the build-up of forces which is taking place in the Gulf at present. Kofi Annan distinguished between pressure exercised by the threat of force and the actual use of force. He expressed the view that without that pressure the inspectors would not be back in Iraq today. I hope this credible threat, rather than the use of force, will resolve the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">We believe that the arms inspectors should be given as much time as is necessary and useful to complete their work. It will be for the Security Council to make a determination as to whether the exercise continues to be worthwhile and what should follow. Iraq must now respond without further delay or excuse and thus put an end to this crisis as well as to the sanctions which have brought so much hardship to its people.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">It would be great if life was simple, if in one corner there were the good guys, with the bad guys in another, like in the cowboy films where the cavalry comes to the rescue and all ends well. In those scenarios there would have been a few dead Indians, but, as Bob Dylan sang, "we have God on our side."  However, life is not like that. It is messy, contradictory and difficult, and everything has a context and a history.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Saddam Hussein is a callous, brutal dictator. Those who suffer most at his hands are the Iraqi people. However, he did not just emerge from the mist; he is the adopted son of the US, or was until they threw him out of the house. He now bites the hand that supplied the arms in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">On the other hand, is the US the policeman of the world? Does it take the Yanks to sort things out? Just a few years ago, while we in Europe passed one meaningless resolution after another, thousands of men, women and children were butchered in the very heart of Europe at Srebenica, and we all know how that ended. Why are the Americans talking to the North Koreans while preparing to bomb Saddam? Oil is a large piece of the jigsaw.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Where in all of this stands Ireland? We have close cultural, family and economic links with the US. There is hardly a family without an uncle, aunt, son or daughter in the US, some of whom may be in the defence forces. For many years, the US military have used Shannon. I listened carefully last night to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. If he speaks the truth, and I have no reason to doubt him, then what is happening in Shannon now is no more than business as usual. Therein lies the problem – this is about the business of neutrality and the business of Shannon. We need to debate it and sort it out, and we need a clear, unequivocal statement from the Government as to what will happen in the event of war.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">There are some in this House who told us just months ago not to trust Berlin; some now tell us not to trust Boston. As a sovereign, independent State, in a world under the threat of global terrorism, we must debate this and find our niche. We must support the decisions of the UN and I support the call by Deputy Connolly for the establishment of an Irish arms and munitions inspectorate. I do not support a unilateral or bilateral approach by the US and the UK. It is within the capabilities of the international community to sort this out, and every effort must be made to avoid war. A recent article suggested that if war breaks out, at least 50,000 people will die. That is the equivalent of every man, woman and child in County Sligo, and a few more besides. I cannot contemplate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The US, with others, invested a great deal of time, energy and commitment to help secure the Good Friday Agreement. As friends, let us try to repay that debt and put all our efforts at EU level and at the UN into a search for solutions without war.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_353">This Private Members' motion condemns the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and its suppression of human rights and national and ethnic rights. I agree with that and want to stress the point. This is a humanitarian motion, not an anti-United States motion. War is ongoing at present, as Mr. Donald Rumsfeld said on 19 January last. There is a state of war with Iraq that has not ended. The cover for that war is supposed to be the use of and access to weapons of mass destruction. Is that the real reason for this war? An American ally, Israel, has 350 nuclear warheads while India and Pakistan are nuclear states. They are all friends and allies of the United States yet we see no action taken against them. The reason for war is hardly because Iraq has breached UN resolutions. Israel, an ally of the United States, has breached 44 UN resolutions in the past yet no action has been taken against it. Instead, there is ongoing support.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Mr. Rumsfeld told us there is an ongoing war. Unfortunately, this country is facilitating and supporting that war and facilitating the transport of US military planes and land forces through its refuelling of planes at Shannon Airport. This is in breach of the Defence Act 1954 and the Air Navigation Regulations 1973. It is also in breach of Article 5 of the Hague Convention which forbids the movement of troops and convoys over neutral countries. I want to make that point strongly. Ireland is a neutral country and should not be used by the United States or this Government as a supporter in a war which has not been discussed in this House, and which is not supported by this House or the vast majority of the people, as has been shown in various opinion polls over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">This is a war about the huge reserves of oil that Iraq holds – 11% of total world reserves. Unfortunately, Ireland is being drawn into this by an unthinking and uncaring Government which allows the facilities at Shannon to be used. I support this motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_356">Amnesty International has highlighted human rights abuses in more than 60 countries worldwide. Iraq is just one of these countries and these issues must also be raised in the future. This motion is about gauging political opinion so that the rest of the country can see what this House believes in. This war is about oil because western society, whether in America or Ireland, consumes huge resources that are purchased cheaply from Third World countries. If we were genuinely concerned about these countries, we would promote a more balanced spread of world wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The Shannon protest would be important if we were discussing what is really meant by saying Ireland is a neutral country. Politicians have not defined for the people what they believe neutrality to be. However, with regard to a world at war with Iraq, the events at Shannon are only a sideshow. They show the concern of a few citizens but much more is happening. Worldwide, organisations such as al-Qaeda have grown out of an anger in poor countries towards wealthy western countries. The West has exploited them for centuries and we are part of this process of exploitation. On the other hand, al-Qaeda aims to make bio-terrorism the Cold War of the 21st century, and smallpox and other bio-chemical weapons have the potential to kill millions. Global terrorism is real and it will affect us, but will a war with Iraq make any difference to a long-term solution?</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The issues of oil, bio-terrorism, Iraq's attitude to the UN and world arms sales are not excuses for going to war but they are issues on which Dáil Éireann – Government and Opposition alike – must have an opinion. There are millions of people suffering under repressive regimes that all western countries, European and American, have chosen to ignore for years. We are not taking the high moral ground on this issue. We bear in mind that the massacres in former Yugoslavia, which prompted NATO to go in, were of Muslims. This does not absolve the United States for bombing Iraq but it does provide a reasoning behind what it has done with regard to Afghanistan and Yugoslavia.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">This motion is not anti-American, nor is it about the role American soldiers play in the Shannon economy. It is about Ireland's role in international diplomacy and promoting a fairness for all people worldwide. Cutting overseas development aid by €34 million says more about our commitment to the international community than any words said in Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">In wrapping up the debate, I thank my colleagues from the Independent group and Technical Group for their considered speeches in the course of the debate. Last night's speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by contrast, was a despicable performance and, if analysed, was a lightly embroidered repetition of the Bush and Blair arguments for an attack on Iraq. The game was given away when there was a point blank refusal by the Government to say that it would break ranks with the warmongers in the case of a unilateral attack on Iraq by the United States. The explanation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of procedures governing the facilities given over to the US military at Shannon was a totally dishonest attempt to cover up the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Last year over 500 military planes landed at Shannon in building up the US war machine in the Middle East and not a single one had permission to carry weapons or munitions of war in flagrant breach of Government regulations. The Government cravenly and deliberately turned a blind eye to the weapons and munitions that such aeroplanes were, undoubtedly, carrying and which will, undoubtedly, be used in the event of a war to slaughter innocent Iraqi people.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">—on the critical issues that a war against Iraq raises about the very future of our planet. Radio Telefís Éireann, our national broadcasting authority, has a crucial role in that regard and I have no doubt that many within it will discharge that role well. However, that belief was not vindicated by the disgraceful pro-war snow job on the Marian Finucane radio programme this morning which lined up a well meaning but hapless peace activist in Shannon against a sneering <i>Sunday Independent</i> journalist, an obscurantist cold warrior and the presenter herself in a disgracefully unbalanced discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Governments of the United States and Britain, slavishly echoed by substantial sections of the western and Irish media, are attempting to shroud their imminent war in a grotesque deception that it is about weapons of mass destruction allegedly held in Iraq. They know the bulk of such weapons were destroyed by 1998 and that it is impossible for the Iraqi dictatorship to develop nuclear weapons. The Saddam Hussein dictatorship knows that if it explodes as much as a single hand grenade outside its borders, it will invite an attack by the massively more destructive weapons of the United States, Britain and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The media know that the obscurantist and grotesque relic of Stalinism in North Korea has incomparably more destructive power than the Iraqi dictatorship but an entirely different strategy will be adopted in that case. The monstrous hypocrisy of the Government, as well as Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair, must be exposed. They decry the heinous nature of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship. So do we. The difference is that we always did.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">It is too bad Fianna Fáil did not realise how heinous a regime the Iraqi dictatorship was in the 1980s when Saddam Hussein's army committed unspeakable atrocities against the Iranians, marching on stomachs filled with Irish beef sent to Saddam Hussein by a Government in which the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was a senior Minister, which exports were underwritten by him with funds provided by the taxpayer. The US Defence Secretary, Mr. Rumsfeld, is also well qualified to speak about Saddam Hussein. He visited him in the mid-1980s in Baghdad to bring the full support of the United States Government for the terrible war against Iran when Iraq was, on a daily basis at that very time, using chemical weapons against the Iranians in total defiance of international conventions. A few weeks ago <i>The Washington Post</i> published a review of thousands of declassified US documents which showed that in the 1980s the United States sent numerous items to Iraq, including poisonous chemicals and deadly biological viruses such as anthrax and bubonic plague. What hypocrisy.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">This war is about control of Iraqi oil and to send a signal to the world that the United States is an imperial power and armed collossus that will bestride the world and dictate its terms. Let no one attempt to gainsay this. The motion stands against the rotten dictatorship and war. We stand with the people and the millions of Americans and British who oppose it. On 15 February tens of thousands of people who oppose the Government's policy and the war will join us in the anti-war mass demonstrations to send a signal to the Government that it must stop its connivance.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_383">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I am delighted to introduce the Second Stage of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill 2002. The Bill consolidates the law relating to capital acquisitions tax which is contained in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 1976 and in provisions in 24 of the subsequent Finance Acts amending and extending that Act. The new consolidation Bill continues the successful process of the ongoing modernisation of the tax code. In 1997, the Taxes Consolidation Act consolidated direct taxes legislation dealing with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">In 1999, the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act consolidated stamp duties legislation. In addition, the consolidation and modernisation of general excise law on mineral oils was included in the Finance Act 1999 and the consolidation and modernisation of general excise law was included in the Finance Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">By way of background, capital acquisitions tax, CAT, consisting of both gift tax and inheritance tax, was passed into law by the Oireachtas on 31 March 1976. The introduction of CAT followed the publication of a White Paper on Capital Taxation in February 1974. This White Paper, among other things, recommended replacing the then method of taxing the assets of a deceased person with a new inheritance tax on benefits. The old tax, known as estate duty, taxed the assets contained in the estate of the deceased person, while the new tax, in contrast, taxed the inheritances received by each of the beneficiaries. In addition, the White Paper also proposed the introduction of a gift tax which was to complement inheritance tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">As a result of the fact that a period of almost 27 years has elapsed since the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act was enacted, and because that Act has been amended and extended in Finance Acts every year since then, with the exception of the 1976, 1979 and 1983 Finance Acts, the need to consolidate the legislation relating to capital acquisitions tax is self-evident. The preparatory process for consolidating capital acquisitions tax followed the same rigorous process that was adopted for the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. The aim at all times was to ensure the most accurate consolidation of the existing law with nothing left out and nothing added. This is what has been achieved in this Bill. The Bill was considered by the Parliamentary Counsel's office and has been duly certified as a consolidation of existing law by the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">In preparing the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill 2002, the Revenue Commissioners adopted much of the same approach as was adopted for the earlier consolidation Acts. An initial draft of the Bill was made available to the Law Society of Ireland, the Institute of Taxation in Ireland and the consultative committee of accountancy bodies in Ireland. In addition, two independent expert referees were appointed to examine the accuracy and structure of the Bill. The comments made by these referees added greatly to the final product. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the parties concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Another area of similarity to the previous consolidation legislation is in the structure of the Bill, where for example, as in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, generally applicable provisions such as definitions and the charging sections appear at the beginning of the Bill. These are then followed by more specialist provisions, for example, special provisions relating to the value of property for the purposes of gift and inheritance tax. In addition, the commencement and transitional provisions are set out at the end of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The use of archaic language in general and of the old-fashioned device of using provisos to change the meaning of a section have also been eliminated in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">To facilitate readers of the Bill, statutory derivations for the legislation provided for in the Bill, which I will refer to as new legislation, are set out in the margin opposite each section. These entries show the source of the new legislation. In addition, the memorandum published with the Bill sets out the old legislation in chronological order and shows the reader where it is located in the new legislation. If a previous provision has not been enacted in the Bill, the memorandum explains why. The most common reasons for not including a provision in the Bill are that the provision in question has already been repealed or it is unnecessary for some reason, for example, it might be superfluous.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The Bill before the House is the culmination of over two years' work. Perhaps the greatest benefit which will result from this consolidation will be the restructuring of the capital acquisitions code in a clear, coherent and logical way. This will make it more accessible and user-friendly for all users, including Members of the Oireachtas, who have to cope with annual changes to the capital acquisitions tax legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The consolidation of capital acquisitions tax will also make it possible for future changes to capital acquisitions tax to be slotted into the Consolidation Act by way of amendment to that Act. It is intended that this should happen and I would like to give the House a commitment to that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I do not intend to go through every section of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum, which has been published with the Bill, sets out in summary form what each section of the Bill is about. However, I would like to give Deputies some flavour of the overall structure of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">Will the Minister change it in the Finance Bill?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_284" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_396">No. However, there will be some additions to the capital acquisitions tax legislation in the Finance Bill, as there have been in 24 of the last 27 such Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The Bill contains 120 sections and three Schedules. It is divided into 12 Parts. Part 1 consists of definitions and rules of construction. It also contains the Short Title. Definitions of terms, which are used throughout the Bill, are contained in this Part. Definitions, which only apply to a particular section, are contained at the beginning of that section. This is in line with the structure adopted for the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Part 2 contains the charging section for gift tax and other provisions relating to gifts. Part 3 contains the charging section for inheritance tax and other general provisions relating to inheritance tax. It also contains provisions dealing with the initial 6% charge imposed on certain discretionary trusts and the subsequent annual 1% charge imposed on such trusts.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Part 4 sets out how property is to be valued for capital acquisitions tax purposes. Part 5 contains general provisions relating to gifts and inheritances. Part 6 contains provisions dealing with returns and assessments. Part 7 contains provisions dealing with the payment of tax, interest and penalties. Part 8 contains provisions dealing with appeals. Part 9 contains the exemptions from gift and inheritance tax. Part 10 contains the various reliefs such as agricultural relief, business relief and other miscellaneous reliefs. Part 11 contains miscellaneous provisions relating to capital acquisitions tax. Part 12 contains provisions relating to repeals, the commencement of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill, when enacted, and transitional provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Revenue Commissioners have prepared guidance notes which they will publish as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted. I understand that these notes will be available on the Revenue's website. For the information of Deputies, the guidance notes follow the format of the guidance notes relating to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">As for the timetable for passage of the Bill, it is proposed that the Bill be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills for consideration next week. A number of motions will be included on the Order Papers of both Houses to comply with the various rules and procedures as set out in Standing Orders, to facilitate the timely passage of the Bill. These motions will facilitate the taking of Committee, Report and Fifth Stages and will shorten the minimum periods of time allowed for in Standing Orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I would like to place on the record my own and the Government's appreciation of the amount of work which went into preparation of the Bill. The staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary counsel's office are to be congratulated on a job well done. The input from the private sector was invaluable and demonstrates what can be achieved through a team approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the co-operation of the House in its speedy enactment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_404">While, undoubtedly, a huge effort has been made by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in producing this Bill, that effort has been somewhat misdirected. The Revenue Commissioners are talking about the need to review and simplify this tax within its own narrow terms. As I understand it, they are commencing such a review, so it is difficult to understand why we should have gone through the considerable effort of reorganising the parliamentary counsel's time to produce this Bill which, from its inception, will be under review and subject to simplification.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">If I were looking at the overall demands currently being placed on the Revenue Commissioners and on the Department of Finance to reform and update our tax laws, I would not look to the consolidation of this legislation. Rather, I would examine the very ill-considered tax policies that have been introduced in recent years and which have resulted in a complete collapse of revenue compared to the predictions made by the Minister and his officials on budget days over the past two years. That is where we should look to see whether we are getting to grips with the administration and application of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">This legislation represents a substantial waste of effort. Sadly, the consequence of the collapse in tax revenues, which we have seen, is that in his last budget the Minister introduced a series of what are rightly described as stealth taxes. Essentially, people are being asked to pay in a thousand different ways for the various miscalculations in administrating tax over the past couple of years. For instance, the cost of the savings scheme, which was one of the Government's most extraordinary decisions, is running at over €600 million and heading for €0.75 billion. That is a huge amount to have to recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">We also know that all the borrowing the Minister is undertaking this year is required for two purposes: first, funding the savings scheme and, second, funding the investment by the pensions reserve fund in overseas stocks and shares. These are real revenue issues that need to be addressed, yet the Bill will not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Despite having produced this legislation, I can understand why the Revenue Commissioners are seeking to review and simplify the capital acquisitions tax code. That revenue currently stands at approximately €135 million, which is less than 0.5% of all tax revenue raised. I suspect that because of the extremely complex nature of the tax, in terms of effort by the Revenue Commissioners it must have the worst cost-to-yield ratio of all taxes. It is extremely complex in terms of aggregation obligations, valuations the Revenue Commissioners have to contest, the administration of exemptions and relief, deciding whether surcharges might be due and in administering other complex provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Welcome as a consolidation of the Bill may be for tax administrators, the time of the House and of the Revenue Commissioners has not been well applied in producing this Bill. If the legislation is to be simplified substantially over the coming years, the effort in producing it will have been misguided. That is not to argue against the capital acquisition of tax, however. Even though its yield is small, it is an important element of an equitable tax code because it contains the principle that those who are in a position to inherit substantial amounts of wealth should make a contribution from that wealth to the Revenue. It is a fair and acceptable principle of equity that those who have the opportunity to acquire great wealth should make an equitable contribution. That is also the reason there is considerable concern that this legislation's provisions can easily be avoided by those with substantial resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It is my understanding – the Minister may correct me if I am wrong – that if a person moves to Newry, for example, and spends enough time there to establish that their residency for tax purposes is not in the State, they can bequeath their resources to their children without paying any tax. This is a problem. A tax such as this has to be seen to be applied equitably. If some people can avoid payment of this tax by simply preplanning absences ahead of making gifts or bequests, it undermines the confidence of the public in the fairness with which the tax is being administered.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">If the Minister was to direct his efforts to consolidating and reforming legislation, even in the area of wealth taxes, I would like to see those efforts invested in the area of stamp duty. The stamp duty code is one of the most difficult to understand and it is applied, in many ways, with extraordinary inequity. It does not have the normal features of any other tax where there are thresholds and bands and if a band is exceeded, tax is paid at one rate on a certain amount and at a higher rate on the next tranche. Stamp duty is applied in such a way that if a threshold is exceeded the higher tax is paid on the whole amount. It is an extremely inequitable tax. Similarly, the inequity in terms of the stamp duty paid by first-time buyers is something people find very difficult to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">If the Minister intends to look to simplification and reform to make these taxes more equitable, stamp duty is an area to which he ought to turn his attention because there is enormous scope for making that tax much fairer in its operation. I suspect that successive Ministers for Finance have decided to leave this sleeping dog lie because generally people pay stamp duty only once in their lives and the clamour for reform is not that great. However, if the Minister is interested in gaining a reputation for having been reforming and for having made the system more fair, he should certainly turn the focus of his effort to stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I mentioned the stealth taxes already. There is widespread concern that these taxes are being introduced at the wrong time from an economic point of view. Everyone knows that, at present, inflation is the greatest threat to our continued economic prosperity. Far from the Government introducing a coherent anti-inflation policy, since the election last summer every Minister has been scrambling to find money from somewhere, whether by increasing the charges for medicines, third level college fees, motor tax or credit cards. Anything that moves is being taxed and that is undermining our competitive position.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I am sure the Minister studies factory gate prices. Last week I saw the figures for the past 12 months. Factory gate prices are down 1%. At a time when the Minister is contributing to the fuelling of inflation in the economy, those who are competing in external markets are seeing their prices fall by 1%. Those prices will fall more sharply because in the US market – our principle market for much of the more modern sectors – the appreciation of the euro against the dollar has been close to 25% in the past 12 months. We are facing real competitive pressures. The appropriate response is not that adopted in the budget. That response was to cut back wherever possible, leave the bureaucracy intact and make people pay more. What we needed was a much more coherent attempt by the Government to review value for money issues and deliver a quality service.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">This is also an opportunity for us to look ahead to the forthcoming debate on the Finance Bill. Another element that is causing general concern is the Minister's decision in the budget to abolish indexation in relation to capital gains tax. He seems to be leaving it intact in relation to capital acquisitions tax. The underlying message this sends to people is that the Minister is willing to become the beneficiary of inflation. That is a bad message to send out. He has done this in two respects. He failed to index any of the bands or allowances in relation to income tax, which has been the standard practice of every Minister and of this Minister in his previous five budgets. Now he is removing indexation from the capital gains tax code not just for one year but for eternity. That means the Minister is setting the Exchequer up to be a major beneficiary of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">We do not want to see the re-emergence of a situation where there is an unhealthy alliance between Ministers for Finance and inflation where, effectively, they are willing to benefit from prices running ahead of wages and ahead of people's savings. It is a rot that should not be allowed develop and it is contrary to any principles of fairness in relation to the tax code. It is interesting that indexation in relation to capital acquisitions tax is still intact, but for how many weeks? Perhaps this day week we will see changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">There are other areas—</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" as="#Acting_Chairman" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Acting Chairman (Mr. McCormack)</from>
          <p eId="para_418">The Deputy should confine himself to capital acquisitions tax.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_419">It is extraordinary that penalties contained in the legislation are so low. The penalty for failure to make a return is only €2,500. The penalty for compliance in failure to make a return is only half of that. Even for fraudulent returns, the penalty is only about €6,500 – albeit there is a penalty in relation to the tax paid when one is caught. In an ideal world, the Revenue should be minimally involved in the administration of a self-assessment tax. In practice, it is hugely involved in the administration of this tax. If we want an efficient self-assessment tax under CAT, we need to have effective penalties and to run it on the basis of any other sound self-assessment tax, that is with high penalties and random audit. That is the way to go. To do that effectively there needs to be a review of the penalty clauses. I am sure the Minister is looking into that.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I note also that in the consolidated Bill the Minister is reinstating the provision whereby if people underpay tax they will be charged 1% interest but if they overpay they will get only 0.5% interest. It is a long-established practice to penalise. However, I hope that when he is consolidating this treatment the Minister will bear in mind the Ombudsman's report which has drawn attention to cases where the Minister does not pay any interest to those who have overpaid and correct that in the Finance Bill. The consolidation of this Bill again underlines the need for equitable treatment of people who overpay tax, particularly those to which the Ombudsman drew attention, people who overpay tax as a result of maladministration on the part of the Revenue Commissioners. The Ombudsman made an important point in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Some practitioners in the field have expressed concern that a Bill that was intended to be a consolidation Bill and, therefore, certified by the Attorney General and by the Minister and his officials is to be subjected to a number of amendments at a later stage. One wonders why changes are needed if this is simply a consolidation Act that has already been certified by the Attorney General. There is some ground for concern about that. However, it is good to have one document relating to tax that contains every tax. The notion of consolidation is, therefore, welcome. However, as I said earlier, I would like to have seen some of the effort that has undoubtedly gone into this directed where it is needed, towards ensuring that our tax system is properly established in law, properly administered in practice and that everyone pays their fair share according to those tax laws.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_422">On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome in principle any Bill which simplifies the administration of taxation. In so far as this Bill makes it easier for citizens and tax professionals to understand and comply with the complex laws on capital acquisitions tax, it is very welcome. It is worth noting that while it may be welcome, it is a strange reflection on the priorities of the Government that parliamentary time can be found for a consolidation Bill, given that our sister parliament in London is many weeks in session and has presumably been able to deal with the gamut of legislation the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has in hand but which we are reaching in a very lethargic way. Clearly, this is crucial legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">There is a long list of urgently needed legislation for which we do not seem to be able to find time. It is odd, therefore, that we can find the time to debate something which can only make the law clearer rather than change it, given that so many changes in the law are needed. Tackling the problem would require more sitting days and some measure of genuine parliamentary reform, which the Government, apparently, is not prepared to countenance. The Leader of the Government seems to prefer to be away from the House rather than being here to debate issues, including this one. On the contrary, the Government seeks to reduce its accountability to the Oireachtas by limiting the number of sitting days. The Taoiseach's attitude to the commencement debate yesterday, which was deplorable, speaks volumes about the lack of respect for the House. We were expecting a type of State of the Union address from the Taoiseach, given that our small State has suffered so many difficulties in the past. Even though it is six weeks since we sat, we had to listen to a brief lecture from the Chief Whip on upcoming legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Having said that, I commend the Minister, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners for the lengthy consolidation process. My colleague, Deputy Quinn, spent a good deal of his time in the last rainbow coalition developing the Taxes Consolidation Act in relation to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. The Minister followed on with this in 1999 with the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act. However, I agree with the comments of my colleague, Deputy Bruton, on the difficulties in that area. The process has also been advanced in the Finance Acts of 1999 and 2001. It is a little unreal to be standing here discussing a Bill which we cannot change. I understand the Minister will table some amendments but it is a strange situation because of the nature of the consolidation. If one looks back at taxation handbooks used by practitioners, one will discover that it is very valuable to have simplified legislation. However, there are a number of aspects, particularly in relation to rates and other areas of capital taxation, which the Labour Party would be interested in considering.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I commend the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners for their work on difficult issues such as aggregation and so on. I commend the Office of the Attorney General and other professionals such as the Law Society and the Institute of Taxation which made comments on the initial draft. I understand there is a time constraint in passing the legislation before the Finance Bill is introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Having read the Bill yesterday, I took an opportunity to look back over the history of capital acquisitions tax. The Minister referred to death duties, including estate and succession duties and a plethora of death duties in place in the 1970s. In the early 1970s large tranches of the population did not pay tax. It was the unfortunate PAYE workers and business people, very often small business people, who were in very visible businesses who bore the brunt of the taxation system at the time. The Minister came to prominence in the 1980s campaigning largely – I know he is haunted by that era – on the disastrous fiscal policies being pursued by Charles Haughey and others in relation to the escalation of the national debt. It was always the contention of my party that there was sufficient money in the country to have provided the kind of social services which former leaders of the Labour Party such as Michael O'Leary, Frank Cluskey and Dick Spring desperately wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">It is interesting to look at the early capital acquisitions tax rates of 5% to 25%, and up to 60% in the four tables, including gift tax at 75%. It seems to be the first attempt at introducing some sort of fairness in the taxation system. I recall in secondary school looking at the canons of taxation and thinking this was a fundamentally unfair country. Many still hold that view. During the years legislation such as the Finance Acts of 1982 and 1984, including the recent capital acquisitions tax system under the Minister, has been operated in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion. It is important, therefore, to have this simplification of the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">A key feature of capital acquisitions tax is the self-assessment system. Under section 59, there will be very low and basic penalties in relation to inheritance tax, gift tax and discretionary trusts. The Labour Party would have been interested in reforming this area. Obviously, it is an important concession to those who need to meet this tax to have a self-assessment system. It has been a cornerstone of the system for the last couple of decades. However, the penalties under section 59 are remarkably weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The explanatory memorandum to the Bill indicates clearly the wide range of legislation incorporated in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, including the Finance Acts 1977-2002. I presume there will be other changes in 2003. The reality is that Deputy McCreevy is a radical Minister who has shown remarkable bottle throughout his career. I profoundly disagree, however, with his approach to fiscal and economic policies. He has a determination and can say he was proved correct about capital gains tax when he halved the rate. Overall, my party and a large proportion of the population believe he presides over a growing, divided society and a bitterly unfair taxation system. He may have noticed, wearing my other hat as Labour Party leader in Dublin City Council, I was embattled in a struggle against local service charges.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_431">The local administration believed it had to embark on this totally undemocratic tax because of the lack of resources. Obviously, our supporters are bitterly opposed to it because they see it as a form of double taxation in a State in which the tax system, including capital acquisitions tax, is grossly unfair. That is the fundamental point I was going to make. The Minister mentioned that we lost the struggle, but we were prepared to take the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to the Supreme Court, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Deputy Cullen mentioned the possible introduction of a system of local income taxation before Christmas, but I do not know if he has run it past the Minister for Finance yet. The previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, used to announce all kinds of things without telling anybody – sometimes he did not even mention them to himself. I believe strongly that in all critical areas of policy Kildare should run Kildare, Cork should run Cork, Mayo should run Mayo and, of course, the Dubs should run Dublin. A system of local taxation may well be a good idea as part of the major reforms needed in this area, such as the introduction of new types of sales tax and VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, should turn his attention to the issues I have mentioned. He has shown that he can be radical in relation to capital acquisitions tax, particularly by slashing tax rates and increasing tax reliefs over the years. In 1998, the Minister gave a special relief to persons aged over 55 and to close relatives. In 1999, he changed the base date for determining the amount of tax due from 1982 to 1988. In budget 2000, he excluded the inheritance of the family home from capital acquisitions tax and introduced the single 20% rate, replacing the multiple rate structure. The Minister introduced the £300,000 threshold with effect from 6 December 2000. In 2002, the base date for aggregation was moved from 1988 to 1991. He has been a radical Minister in relation to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax, but I contend that he has introduced changes that ultimately reduce the possibility of maximising yields from capital taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The tax strategy group paper that was released yesterday sets out a most revealing picture of the Government's record in respect of capital taxation. It shows how the Government has substantially reduced the rates of taxation that apply to both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax from 40% to 20% in each case. It is remarkable that a single PAYE worker earning more than €28,000 pays tax at a marginal rate of 42% whereas the capital taxes I have mentioned stand at 20%. When I looked at the most recent budget, I noticed that the projected yield from capital taxation in 2003 is only about 3.3% of the total tax take of €31.6 billion and that the relevant figure for 2002 was only 2.48% of the €29 billion total. Income tax, paid largely by PAYE workers, accounts for almost 30% of total tax take and VAT accounts for a similar percentage.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I concur with Deputy Richard Bruton's view that the Minister's decision not to change tax bands in the budget, allied to the vicious increase in VAT, has made the tax system greatly more regressive than it was a couple of months ago. Working families and families on social welfare are bearing the brunt of the Minister's choices. It has to be said that, along with reducing debt to 34% of GDP, the divided society we now have will be the Minister for Finance's legacy. In years to come, people will ask if this coalition Government, which I hope will not be in power after 2006 or 2007, enhanced social divisions by grossly reducing any possibility of extending or widening the tax base.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">It is worrying that capital taxation, according to the projections made by the Minister's officials in the budget, will fall to €998 million, or 2.77% of total tax receipts. The capital acquisitions tax yield, as outlined in the tax strategy group papers, also makes interesting reading, as a modest increase on 2001 is projected. The tax structure under this Government has resulted in the vast burden of tax being shouldered by PAYE workers, a phenomenon that will be consolidated by this Bill. Those who have major capital assets, on the other hand, can escape the tax net, in effect, as a result of the ideological vision brought to the Government by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Minister has made much of the increase in revenues from capital gains tax since he halved the rate. The Government claims that the increased yields result from its tax policy, which is based on the belief that lower rates result in higher levels of activity. This may be true, but one wonders how much of the additional activity has resulted from people taking advantage of the significant difference in the rates of taxation of capital gains and capital acquisitions, on the one hand, and ordinary earned income on the other. Such a difference offers a major incentive to find ways of categorising earned income as a capital gain or acquisition. If the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners are interested in finding reasons for the decrease in income tax yield in recent years, they would do well to examine the issue I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Our system of capital taxation contains a simple injustice. Taxing capital at a lower rate than earned income flies in the face of notions of social justice or equitable taxation. It is known that capital is even more unequally distributed than income in Ireland, which has one of the most uneven distributions of income in the advanced world. The uneven distribution is made worse by the actions of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government, even though Deputies opposite may claim to be uncomfortable with the fact. The Minister has presented a major gift to the well-to-do by cutting rates of capital taxes, although I assume he will not go as far as President George W. Bush, who recently introduced budgetary measures that will take rich people entirely out of the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Government decisions I have mentioned are part of its broader ideological agenda to make the tax system as unfair and unequal as possible. Why else would the Minister have made such strident efforts to cut taxes for the better-off at a time when the economy was growing at unprecedented rates? Other legacies of the Minister for Finance's term in office are Ireland's high rate of inflation, which is twice the EU average, and a decline in our competitiveness, which is a direct result of the Minister's foolhardy determination to transfer resources to the better-off. The Minister's decisions badly overheated the economy, thereby directly contributing to the hard landing we are now experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">When we look back at the boom, it is a salutary lesson to realise the full extent of the Government's mismanagement of the economy. The tax levels paid by the rich were slashed due to the Government's misguided ideology and its determination to win the general election at all costs. The consequences of these policies are now being felt by working people throughout the country, who are paying the price of high inflation, short-time work and, in all too many cases, redundancy. Far too many families are encumbered by large debts, accumulated during the boom when the Government promised year after year of lower taxes. The well-off benefited most and working families are paying the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Since the boom ended, we have learned that the Minister for Finance is ideologically opposed to public borrowing, despite the fact that we have the second lowest debt to GDP ratio in the EU. Perhaps there is no point in mentioning Luxembourg. Despite the low interest rate regime which membership of the eurozone brings and the fact that the exchange rate risk in respect of foreign debt has been all but eliminated, the Minister rejects the notion that we should borrow to invest in our economic future. He is backed up by the Taoiseach who insists that the nation is only a step away from bankruptcy.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The Minister did a brilliant flimflam job after the election, with all the sad faces on display and George Lee getting everybody terrified on the six o'clock and nine o'clock news. The Minister created a major myth, namely, that the country had a current budget surplus of €5.4 billion all the time. Despite this, the Minister insisted – and continues to insist – on cutting public services to reduce borrowing. The upshot is that we are presented with cases in which people have died.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">On Friday night I dealt with the case of a man suffering from a serious condition who died while on a trolley in an accident and emergency department. My great predecessor, Conor Cruise O'Brien, although I did not agree with his approach to the national question, had some interesting political philosophies. He believed that the people who run the State are directly responsible for what happens in it. He would have said that the cutbacks in health, and also the mismanagement over which the Minister for Health and Children presides, might have contributed towards this horrific tragedy. There can be terrible outcomes as a result of the kind of taxation strategies we have pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Even if the Minister wanted to avoid borrowing, he still had the option of increasing taxation rather than reducing services. In particular, he could have found ways of ensuring that the better off in our society pay a fair share. He has also rejected that prescription. He has refused, for example, to raise a meaningful contribution from the horse-breeding industry. Before Christmas, some of the Minister's constituents and various others in the horse industry came to the Oireachtas to present the case against any kind of taxation of stallions. It is interesting that they did not go to see the Minister, they went to see Deputy Rabbitte, my party leader. They obviously felt there was no need to see the Minister because he represented Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The Bill includes a range of exemptions. In a fairer society we would consider all of them. For example, artists and writers have done well in this State. To be an artist or a writer is an honourable profession, just like any other job, and perhaps everyone should pay his or her fair share.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">In the Minister's county – it is the birthplace of some of my ancestors and I hold it in high regard – a significant proportion of the population is working in the horse industry at all levels. Deputy Stagg used to say that it was the only place in Ireland where the pubs fell silent as the racing results came on the six o'clock news. While those jobs are very important, we frequently see the top men in this very wealthy industry flashing their wealth around, hopping from Manchester to Glasgow and Leopardstown to Cheltenham. Maybe they could pay a fairer share.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_448">I thank the Acting Chairman for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The commitments made before the election in relation to the national anti-poverty strategy – a portfolio in respect of which I used to represent my party – turned out to be all manner of promises which the Minister and the Government once again felt able to break. On many occasions I called on the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Finance to link social welfare income to the average industrial wage for those who have no other means. However, since the recent budget Deputy Coughlan's Department has completely abandoned that idea. The Government has, therefore, completely fallen out of line with its commitments under the strategy. The Minister for Finance felt obliged to deliver to the corporate sector, but felt he could renege on his promises to the poor. For example, he could have raised the rate of capital acquisitions tax. I am not sure what he will do in the future, but he has opted not to do so thus far.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">It says something about the priorities of the Government that it would rather maintain lower rates of capital taxes than deal with the growing crisis in, for example, the area of crime. I will not stray off into that territory, but we all remember a key promise made by the Minister involving the provision of 2,000 extra gardaí. I recently had a meeting with the four superintendents from my locality, Dublin metropolitan area north. They did not say it, but it seemed they did not have adequate resources. We do not need to mention another Irish city and the horrible events taking place there. The Minister did not deliver on a simple promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">In the year or two before the election Cork, Limerick and Dublin took part in the RAPID programme, involving intervention in disadvantaged districts. I can see nothing happening under this programme, which was supposed to add to the infrastructure in many areas to try to prevent people from falling into crime and other problems. It all comes back to the Minister's decisions – I recognise that Deputy McCreevy is a radical Minister in relation to capital taxation – and his failure to spread taxation around.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">It is worth pointing out why we have capital acquisitions tax at all. Capital acquisitions are basically gifts, inheritances and trusts. We are used to arguments from the Tánaiste about how lower tax on income creates an incentive, but does that really apply to gifts? The Bill describes the person who receives the gift or inheritance as the "donee" or "successor". How are we encouraging economic activity by having lower taxes on gifts than on income earned from employment? In fact, in any society which professes to believe in equality of opportunity, let alone equality of outcome, it is essential to have a reasonable level of taxation on gifts and inheritance and on management of trusts. Otherwise we simply facilitate the multiplication of inequality over the generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">It is interesting to see, in OECD advanced countries, the way in which the more wealthy sections of society are enabled to transfer wealth from generation to generation. Families do not tend to go up and down, they tend to go up and stay up, while some of the rest of us, including the people represented by Members on this side of the House, stay down.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">This Government intends to re-introduce third level fees and has had the effrontery to claim that doing so would be an egalitarian measure. Its members claim that the children of the better off should pay for third level education. If they are so keen to make the children of the better off pay their share, would it not be more logical to require them to pay a reasonable level of tax on gifts and inheritance? Would it not be reasonable to pay tax on gifts and inheritance at at least the same rate as earned income? The truth is that the Government has no real interest in equality or fairness. It sees its role as serving the interests of the well heeled at the expense of working families. It constantly protects them against any form of fair taxation and its position on capital acquisitions is another example of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">My colleague referred to section 59. In this age of self-assessment, the penalties seem to be ludicrously low. This should be investigated. Some years ago there used to be problems with aggregation of benefits. I wonder if the position in that regard has been clarified to everybody's satisfaction in the Bill. I welcomed the recent comments by Mr. Frank Daly, the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, to the effect that there will no longer be any hiding place for those who evade tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">A few months ago we discussed Ansbacher, DIRT and some of the other scams that have happened over the years. It is good to see that the Revenue Commissioners have, as shown in their tax compliance document, succeeded in bringing the percentage of outstanding tax liabilities for collection down to an all-time low. The Acting Chairman and I used to have interesting debates with the Revenue Commissioners when we were both members of the Committee of Public Accounts during the 27th Dáil. That was before we discovered the enormous scams that were going on, when Ansbacher was just a German name of which we had never heard. We suspected things were happening and we would try to rattle the chairman of the Commissioners and convince the Comptroller and Auditor General to pursue the issues. We, and the other members at that time, including Deputy Rabbitte and the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, initiated some of the developments which have led to a much more compliant regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">On the legislation, I read that we only have 400 audits per year, which is a small check on the extent of wealth in this country. I commend the Minister for the Bill and ask him to think again about the strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">Given the interest for this debate in the Chamber, there could be an argument for separate slots. I congratulate Deputy Broughan for literally exhausting his 30 minute slot. What I have to say will not take that long and I am sure my colleagues will remain within a similar timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">In general, my party supports and encourages the principle of consolidation of legislation but questions why there is such a sense of priority about this tax. I am grateful for the briefings the Department of Finance has provided in anticipation of the legislation. Other questions should have been asked and perhaps one final Bill would have allowed us to make necessary changes to the tax itself or question the future of the tax before the consolidation exercise took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">It is unfortunate we are not using this opportunity to put the three ‘e' test that every tax has to be put through to gauge whether it is efficient, effective and equitable. We can ask questions on capital acquisitions tax as to whether each of these criteria is being met. It is a low-yield tax which does not raise much for the Exchequer and is inefficient in terms of the administrative back-up it requires to produce that yield. Whether it is equitable depends on what standpoint one takes. Some people get badly caught out in terms of gifts and inheritance and, for those individuals, the tax is inequitable. The problem with this capital tax as with many others is that the equity is perverse because many people who benefit from income as a result of having assets are rewarded by our taxation system and, rather than consolidate inequitable taxes like this Bill does, we should address the real and deep inequalities that exist in our system of taxation. It has already been mentioned that Ireland is the OECD's second most unequal nation in terms of wealth disparity, just behind our American cousins.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Within that we have the lowest tax yield of all taxes collected by the Revenue Commissioners. Even if one analyses those low tax yields, the balance between the taxes is heavily weighted towards taxes on people's income. This is a negative tax. We should instead encourage people to earn as much money as possible, hold on to as much as possible and tax negative activities within society through environmental taxes, for instance, which my party promotes, as well as taxes on wealth. The capital taxation system, as Deputy Broughan has pointed out, accounts for a mere 3.6% of all taxes collected in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Because of that inequity, the Opposition must challenge the Government for representing the interests of the few – those who benefit from being on the right side of the wealth disparity which this country is so unwilling to properly tackle. I welcome the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, who, under his portfolios, deals with the results of those inequalities. Through a series of budgets, the Minister for Finance has failed to tackle the fact that Irish people are more sinned against in terms of income tax and less so in terms of capital tax. I would take legislation like this more seriously if I thought that real reform was involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I do not agree with Deputy Broughan's description of the Minister as radical. My definition of radicalism is about reform in its real sense. It is not radicalism for change's sake or entrenching bad practices and inequalities that exist in our society and making them worse. On all those grounds, the Minister should be continually challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">There are difficulties in the Capital Acquisition Tax Consolidation Bill 2002 which cannot be addressed by way of amendment and there is a degree of superfluity about a debate of this nature. Why have we not looked at the difficulties, despite the indexing that exists in the levying of this tax, concerning the difference between actual inflation and the multiplier effect that exists with property inflation and how people will get caught out by it? Why are we not reflecting the realities of changing life within Irish society and Europe concerning what inheritance comes from where and from whom? For example, a number of European countries have legislated recently for legal recognition of couples of the same gender. We are in the EU and people who live within our jurisdiction will seek some kind of parity in terms of taxes of this type when matters such as gifts and inheritances are involved. I do not see how the nature of capital taxation, particularly capital acquisitions taxes, can evolve in light of those changing circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">A consolidation Bill at this stage is disappointing because we have missed the wider picture. It should have been brought forward in the context of real reform of the taxation system. The disparities that exist in society as a result of the budget will worsen still further when the Finance Bill is introduced in coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I reiterate my general support for the nature of consolidation of this area of legislation. I hope that the Minister and the Department will think about what has been said in this debate and introduce further legislation that will tackle the more important areas of fiscal policy, and I hope we will have a real debate and bring those changes about.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_469">I welcome the introduction of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill 2002. It is a step towards making the legislation regarding capital acquisitions tax clearer and less cumbersome. However, there remain significant shortcomings which I will highlight and which I hope the Minister will address. I would appreciate if he would take notes on the anomalies I intend to draw to his attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">This is an opportune time to reiterate Sinn Féin's belief that there needs to be a comprehensive review of the taxation system in this State. We need to rebuild our tax regime based on the principles of equity and transparency so it becomes a fair and just means of distributing the resources of the State. To do this properly will involve all the social partners, there must be a time limit and we must seek to formulate proposals for a truly equitable tax system. The contributions of businesses and the wealthy have continued to decrease while the average worker and consumer has ended up making an even greater contribution to the total tax revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">We need to take the low-paid out of the tax net through increasing tax credits. As I said, I was deeply disappointed that the Minister did not take the required steps in the budget he introduced in the last term to address the disgraceful situation where people not yet in receipt of the minimum wage were still in the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">We need to evaluate the array of tax reliefs set up during the years to see what benefits we are getting from them and what are the costs. My party is calling for an increase in the rate of capital gains tax to 40%, as the Minister will know from the pre-budget submissions I have sent him each year since I became a Member of this House. We want to see it increased to the level it was at before the Minister took office. The cut of 20% impacted hugely in favour of the most well-off. The average worker has to pay tax at the rate of 40% at the high end of his or her income while his or her wealthier bosses do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The recently released CORI Justice Commission briefing document on this matter states the total take from tax and social insurance clearly illustrate the inequalities within the current tax system. The CORI Justice Commission compared the post-budget tax take of the State with those in other EU countries and found that, although Ireland's <i>per capita</i> income is far above the EU average, its infrastructure and social provision are a long way below it. This is because of the Government's insistence on keeping tax takes far lower than the EU average. The CORI Justice Commission's analysis shows that Ireland's total receipts from tax and social insurance post-budget 2003 are the lowest in the European Union when measured either in GDP or GNP terms. They are at least 7.5% below the EU average when measured in terms of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Let us look at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2001 which further highlights the current deficiencies in the tax system which are continuing to be nurtured by the Minister and his Government colleagues. These deficiencies have to be addressed. The report looks at the weaknesses in the work of the Revenue Commissioners in the areas of compliance, registration and enforcement, and examines the appropriateness of certain tax write-off decisions taken. It finds that the tax registration process needs to be tightened up, that there is a lack of monitoring and review in the area of compliance, and that there is a need for prompt and, importantly, decisive action in the area of enforcement. It concludes that write-off decisions taken by the Revenue Commissioners, who I am sure are represented here today, were taken based on inadequate decisions. It states the following: "Given the depth of information revealed in some cases, the Revenue write off review could only be considered to be superficial in nature".</p>
          <p eId="para_475">These inefficiencies have led to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer. It is very important, therefore, that Members of the House address them. Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states there was no assessment of the extent of non-compliance or the likely size of the full tax debt and that the write-off was based purely on charges on record, even where these only equated to some payments from a failed fixed payment arrangement. This raises serious concerns about the functioning of our tax system. The report states the extent of the write-offs may hide the successful efforts of tax evaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report further endorse Sinn Féin's assertion that there needs to be a comprehensive review of the entire taxation system. The Minister has the time to do this but the process needs to be time-limited. Why does he not take the opportunity to set in train such a review?</p>

          <p eId="para_481">The principal definitions are clearly laid out in this Bill and I welcome the clarity and detail. In the knowledge that time is limited, I will speak about sections 4, 46, 47, 51, 55 and 59 which are extremely relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Section 4 imposes the charge of tax on gifts and provides that the tax will be charged, levied and paid on the taxable value of each taxable gift taken by a donee. I welcome section 46 which requires a person primarily liable for payment of tax to deliver a return and assess and pay the tax within four months of the valuation date. This tightens up the procedures and gets revenue in quickly without too much delay. We need efficient management of our taxes to ensure the maximum quality and expenditure on our public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Section 47 is essential because it ensures returns are signed by an accountable person. This will guarantee honesty and transparency which we are still lacking in our whole taxation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Section 59 deals with hardship cases. We must always be compassionate in respect of genuine hardship cases. Life is like that and people have problems from time to time. The section allows time for postponement. However, it should only be for genuine hardship cases. The fat cats in our society should never be let away with ripping people off. It is important that we keep this in mind while addressing the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Section 109 provides that when a sum of money exceeding €31,750 is lodged or deposited with the banker in the joint names of two or more persons, the banker cannot on the death of one of the persons pay the money or any part of it to the survivor or survivors without first obtaining from the Revenue Commissioners either a certificate confirming that there is no outstanding charge to tax or consent in writing to the payment.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_487">Deputy Connolly will be delighted. I welcome the fact that the requirement to which I referred does not apply where the person who dies is the spouse of the surviving joint account holder. This is particularly important for couples and also where a sad tragedy occurs in a family. However, there are always legal necessities in legislation and while these should be well planned and enforced, they should also be based on compassion and human need. We must constantly bear this in mind. Before Christmas, the Government tried to rush through a disability Bill which had major flaws and antagonised every disability group in the country. I hope it has learned from the experience and I welcome the deep consultation process of the past few months on this issue. Legislation should always be planned and implemented in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Section 1(1)(6) of the Bill provides for the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations which may be necessary to give effect to the Act and states that every such regulation must be laid before the Dáil. I have the highest respect and regard for the Revenue Commissioners and I use this opportunity to pay tribute to the valuable work they do in the interest of the law abiding taxpayer. At the same time, I strongly support the laying of their regulations before the House. It is essential that there is a link between quality public servants, accountability and democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Regarding taxation, it should always be recognised that the country is run and paid for by the PAYE workers. I thank them for their massive contribution to paying for and running our services and I challenge those who do not pay their fair share of taxes to get off the fence and play their part. We should never lose sight of how much revenue PAYE workers contribute. I concur with Deputy Boyle's remarks in relation to the Minister for Finance and I strongly disagree with Deputy Broughan's contention that Deputy McCreevy is radical. He is not radical enough, unlike the President of Brazil who speaks about a radical civic republicanism. He wishes to include every citizen in that republicanism and he is to redeploy $700 million which was available to be spent on military aircraft, the order for which he has postponed. The money is now to be used for food vouchers for the 10 million poorest people in the state. This form of radicalism should be put to our Minister for Finance. Today he has an opportunity to prove how radical he is. He should bring in a small supplementary budget of €20 million to be aimed at the crisis in disability waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">We have made progress, but there is a still a long way to go before we achieve equity in the taxation system. I commended the Revenue Commissioners who have done excellent work in tackling those who do not pay their taxes. The figure of €127 million in settlements which have been made was published recently. This revenue should be used to fund services. I accept that we have made progress, but we have much more to do.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_493">This Bill is welcome, if only because it continues the process of streamlining and modernising our tax legislation. Income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax were dealt with previously, as was stamp duty legislation and excise law. Anything which consolidates and simplifies the capital acquisitions tax legislation and subsequent Finance Acts will make a coherent and valuable contribution to the further evolution of tax legislation generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">A wise man once said that where there is a will, there is a bill. In the case of the CAT one has the distasteful task of considering one's mortality and what may happen when one passes away. Such morbid thoughts are part and parcel of the capital acquisitions tax process and can pay off when one is enabled to minimise one's CAP liability by availing of the various tax thresholds which allow inheritances to pass CAP free. In the unreal world of tax, an average family of relatively modest means may be shocked when told that they may be considered wealthy with all the attendant problems that entails when they attempt to provide for their children. Galloping property values in particular create this possibility for many families throughout the country. The introduction of family home exemption does not mean that the transfer of the home is automatically exempted from capital acquisitions tax. There are stringent conditions which will not suit everybody's circumstances. The home is generally a family's biggest asset, especially with property prices going through the roof. Many feel they can forget about capital acquisition tax in relation to the home, but they may not be aware of the conditions. Those conditions may be difficult to meet especially since most offspring have their own homes or an interest in another property.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Escalating house prices must also be factored into any decision in relation to section 60 policies which cover the tax payable on a house. House values have increased dramatically from year to year. If this increase is not factored in, a capital acquisition tax liability beyond the amount covered by the premium might be payable. Passing on family wealth invariably involves consideration of taxation which can in certain cases result in significant charges. Transferring wealth can potentially trigger capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and probate tax. In the case of gifts, capital gains tax, gift tax and stamp duty must be considered, and in the case of an inheritance the primary taxes are inheritance and probate tax. In general, the gift or inheritance is assessed at market value on the day the gift or inheritance is made or is capable of being given, with special rules applying to agricultural property and family businesses. In the interest of a more streamlined, simplified and coherent taxation regime, I welcome this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_496">I thank Deputies for their contributions and the general welcome they have given to the consolidation of the capital acquisitions tax code. As I pointed out during my opening remarks, the legislation was first enacted in 1976 and in every Finance Act except three some changes have been made to it. Consolidation has been a major operation for the Department of Finance and, particularly, the Revenue Commissioners. The method they initiated in the preparation of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, was repeated in this instance and it has worked effectively. It incorporates the public and private sectors. Hopefully, this legislation will give relief to people who have to make a living by understanding laws in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">On Second Stage, I pointed out that as this is to be a consolidation Act, no substantive changes in law are being made. The Bill consolidates existing legislation and the Attorney General has stated that to be the case. In the course of the debate, it was inevitable that Deputies opposite would raise some matters relating to CAT legislation. Deputy Richard Bruton referred to the current review of CAT legislation by the Revenue Commissioners, the first stage of which is the consolidation of existing legislation. This is not unusual as it would be hard to review something that is not consolidated. In any event, the law in this area was badly in need of consolidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Deputy Bruton also referred to the change I made some years ago to the residency provisions with regard to CAT liability. As the Deputy is aware, the income tax residency provisions were changed somewhat in 1994. Residence in the State is the basis for income tax as it is in most other countries, but there were unusual rules regarding CAT residency rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">A few years ago I availed of the opportunity to put it on a residency basis also.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Irish property is always subject to capital acquisitions tax. If Deputy Richard Burton decided for taxation purposes to become resident in an exotic location—</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_501">Things are not that bad.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_307" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_502">If in such circumstances he disclosed an interest in property in County Mayo, it would come under the terms of the CAT legislation, irrespective of where he was resident for taxation purposes. The situation would be unchanged even where he was resident abroad for a long period of time, say 20 years. That is the position for Irish real property.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">With regard to non-Irish real property, the capital acquisition charge arises if either the disponer or the beneficiary is Irish resident or non-ordinarily resident. Deputy Bruton referred to cases where people move across the Border. That approach would not work because the person would have to be non-ordinarily resident for a considerable period, say four to five years. The receiver of the money would also have to be a non-Irish resident.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Under the old rules there were possible avoidance mechanisms. In one celebrated case involving a prominent person, the assets were non-Irish and the gift was given outside the territory. In such circumstances no liability would have attached. The fact that the person concerned did not contest that point is irrelevant. That was the law since the initiation of CAT in 1976 and I changed it to a more easily understood residency basis. A person would have to be out of the State for a long period of time before losing the status of ordinarily resident in Ireland, which is a criterion used in both capital gains and capital acquisitions tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">A number of years ago I introduced the shared home relief, which was widely welcomed. Difficulties had arisen when the relationship between two house residents were not of husband and wife status. In such circumstances and where two people lived together for a period of time, if the owner of the house died and there was no blood relationship with the person to whom the house was willed, enormous taxation difficulties presented to the survivor. The relief I introduced takes no account of the nature of the relationship between the donor and the donee.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I was amused to hear Deputy Broughan refer to some of the reliefs in the capital acquisitions tax code. Perhaps the most significant is the 90% business or agriculture relief introduced by the former leader of his party when he was Minister for Finance. It was extraordinarily generous for a person of a socialist persuasion to introduce this relief. Deputy Richard Bruton was a member of that Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Most of the CAT exemptions referred to are in place for social or national reasons. An example is the exemption for a surviving spouse. If my memory is correct, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, introduced the provision that any transaction between husband and wife was exempt from capital acquisitions tax. If I recall correctly, the same class one threshold applying to gifts from parents to children also applied between spouses. It was a good development.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Other exemptions deal with pensions, heritage, property, charities and care of sick relatives and incapacitated persons. One Deputy questioned whether my taxation philosophy would mean following President Bush's example in the various measures he has announced in the past few weeks. In 1999, I abolished the tax credit on dividends, thereby making it fully taxable, which is the opposite of what President Bush proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I thank Deputies for their contributions. It is important that this Bill is passed within a short period of time and I thank them for their co-operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">This Bill was last before the House on Wednesday, 13 November. Safety is pivotal to the future of the railways. Thankfully, Ireland has been lucky to have been spared the horrors afflicting the rail networks in Britain and continental Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The Bill marks a turning point in the history of railway transport in Ireland. Often politicians are accused of reacting rather than acting. The legislation establishes an onus on the State through the commission to ensure the safety of those coming into contact with the railways.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">With this Bill, Dáil Éireann will be able to say that it did not take a major disaster or loss of life before something was done about the mess in the railways. This morning's report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> is worrying. It claims that a secret study shows that Iarnród Éireann is run like a prison, where a climate of victimisation, bullying, harassment, mistrust and poor communications prevail. Especially worrying is the state of the company's infrastructure division, which is responsible for track maintenance, signal systems and bridge and rail safety. This is why the Bill is so important for rail safety. I hope it has a speedy passage through both Houses. I referred earlier to the battle to encourage more people to use rail transport, but this morning's leaked report does nothing to allay the fears of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The media is full of reports of Luas lines and metro plans. However, it is time the capital city had a proper commuter rail network system. If my party was in Government, Dublin would have its Luas system operational today and would not suffer from the terrible and deteriorating traffic jams the construction of the network is causing. The largest city in the country should be able to boast of its ability to get citizens from one destination to another on time. London, Paris and virtually every other capital city in the developed world can do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The needs of my constituents in County Clare are different. The county's rail network is far from comprehensive. Long delays in travelling by public transport from one destination to another does not arise because there is virtually no such transport in rural areas. My constituents do not wait hours but years for trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Iarnród Éireann is upgrading the Ennis to Limerick line and its work will be completed by the end of this year. The company has informed me that a speedy service will then be in place. Regarding rail safety, I must mention, however, an incident which occurred last Sunday week close to Limerick when a locomotive struck a tractor placed on the railway line by vandals. Nobody was injured but they could have been if the train had derailed. The locomotive was damaged and passengers had to wait 90 minutes before a new one came. The danger posed by vandals concerns me greatly and I hope it will not prohibit the development of the line. Last October Iarnród Éireann broke up the crossover link on the Claremorris line at Athenry. This concerns me, particularly with regard to the development of the western line. I hope this is a short-term measure and that Iarnród Éireann will consider developing the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">There is one proviso to my support for the Bill. The legislation must not be left to work in isolation or ignored. The new commission will be allowed to do its job but it is the Government, held to account by this House, on which the burden remains. It is the Government which must continually drive forward the safety agenda and ensure the expansion of the rail network which is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Support for the Bill is a no-brainer. It is common sense that Ireland must have confidence in its railways as railways have been the scene of carnage and mayhem worldwide and we have not been totally spared major train accidents in our history. Though accidents have been limited in number, this does not mean that we can be filled with confidence about the state of our rail system. The IMRS report showed the trouble we were in and, more importantly, the trouble avoided, though only by a miracle. Given the level of risk detected, it is extraordinary that more people were not killed or injured in rail accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Fine Gael supports the Bill but that should not blind the House or the Government to what remains to be done. The railways must be made safe in order that we can reap the benefit of a heightened confidence which must be matched by the political will to drag the rail network out of the Dark Ages and into the 21st century. Fine Gael will watch what the Government does to follow up this excellent Bill to ensure the forward momentum is continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">This should not be a false dawn but a new beginning for safety, for rail users and a proper train service which all can use safely and efficiently. When the history of the railways is rewritten – that is what we allow for with this Bill – it will be remembered that 2002 and 2003 saw the foundations laid for expansion and that not only was safety for Ireland's rail network ensured but also its future. If we can tell the people our trains are safe, we will win the battle and win more people over to using the railways.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_525">While the Bill refers specifically to safety on the rail network, we cannot discuss safety in isolation but must refer to the economic aspect of public transport in general and many other wide-ranging issues. I am sure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will permit this because the issues are linked. Safety is greatly dependent on the finance available.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">I was happy to hear Deputy Pat Breen refer to this as an excellent Bill because that is what it is. In some ways it is long overdue but, having said that, it is timely in that it can cover the emergence of Luas and the metro as well as including older parts such as heritage railways, which are being brought back into use in several areas, including Clare and north Kerry. I welcome the Bill for these reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I was struck by the huge amount of previous legislation referred to in the Bill, some dating back to the 1850s. We should put our minds to some type of consolidation of the legislation regarding public transport, specifically railways. It is ludicrous that it might be necessary to appeal a piece of 1836 legislation at this time. Legislation in many areas has lately been consolidated such as taxation and others, and the Minister might put his mind to this. It can be frustrating, particularly after an accident, to find that there is a vague past reference to issues that might impinge on an inquiry. In modern times, with the changes and huge investment taking place, we should look at this area with a mind to updating the legislation by means of a modern railways Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">We, in Ireland, have been fortunate to have had a high level of safe transport of passengers which we take for granted at times. It is a dangerous presumption that every train will run safely, even with inspection. We have not had too many bad experiences, though there have been some. The Buttevant disaster in County Cork 15 or 16 years ago is one example but we have been fortunate. I compliment all those involved with rail safety such as crane inspectors, rail inspectors and related staff. They have a tough job to do; it is an all-weather, all-year round job and their vigilance that ensures passengers get to their destinations safely. Iarnród Éireann staff – CIE staff previously – have worked to an excellent standard and, against all odds, maintained tracks and rolling stock which in some cases were totally outdated and should have been done away with years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">That kind of safeguard comes at a cost and it is in that area that any discussion on privatisation or deregulation will have to take place. Having spent most of my adult life working in the semi-State sector, I support the involvement of the State in the sector. All things being equal, I would lean in that direction but recognise that arguments will be made for privatisation. When that debate begins, safety of passengers will have be looked at closely as it must be the priority. Second to that, a good, timely service is required in regard to which there are questions to be asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The debate is ongoing with regard to a number of lines, including the loss of local lines due to the loss of freight in particular areas. I recall one example of a knee-jerk reaction from the old CIE with regard to the Cork-Cobh line. During the 1980s Cork was hit by the closure of a number of major employers, Dunlop and Ford being two, which were manned, by and large, from Cobh and outlying areas. Some years later Verolme dockyard, to which workers were ferried from the city to Rushbrook, failed and there was a knee-jerk reaction to close the line to it. I was a local councillor at the time and argued against this for a long time for a number of reasons, philosophical and otherwise. At the time I was not interested in the green issues which are now so prominent on the political agenda. However, in view of our previous experience of closing lines I felt it would be a retrograde step. The old Macroom to Bandon railway line ran within 40 feet of my home and I had seen lines being closed. I argued against that closure but there was no point in arguing with the mandarins of CIE at that time. They quoted facts, figures and surveys similar to those which are being quoted at present. They surveyed the number of people who would use the railway line and what the profit on that number of passengers would be, and they pursued their objective for two years or more. They reported that people would prefer to travel by bus from Cobh to Cork and back. However, some sea change took place although I do not know what the catalyst for that was. A suitable locomotive and a couple of purpose-built carriages were purchased and the service took off. It became an excellent and sought after service and is now one of the most viable services of any CIE spur line.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">We must encourage Iarnród Éireann to take a long-term view. Where there is a difficulty with passenger numbers or with freight we should encourage the company not to employ a knee-jerk reaction but to play tough. In the commercial world Say's Law states that supply creates its own demand. I saw this phenomenon in action on the Cobh line where a suitable, clean and economically viable service with well structured fares was soon found to be unable to cope with the number of passengers wishing to travel and extra carriages had to be added to the trains. The same will apply in many other areas in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">It can be difficult for Iarnród Éireann to pursue certain issues without adequate Government funding and in the face of public comment, which can create difficulties. It was claimed that the DART, for example, would not work because the line was bound on one side by the sea and a survey on the proposed Luas system claims that only 1% of the people surveyed would be willing to use it. It is difficult for a company to override that kind of negativity. Iarnród Éireann must deal with such arguments, with demands that the company be commercially viable and with many other pressures. Nevertheless, the company should always remember Say's Law – supply creates its own demand. I encourage the company to investigate all avenues and to provide a good service because viable services will succeed. The present regime in Iarnród Éireann builds the safety factor into all considerations of viability and I hope we never lose that guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">We must persuade people to use the public service. However, people cannot afford to act on philosophical arguments about being civic minded and supporting public services. If the service is good, punctual, clean and properly priced people will avail of it. A bus service is now provided from Heuston Station to Dublin Airport and from Heuston Station to Dublin city centre. A queue of double decker buses is lined up, almost permanently, at Heuston Station. I am sure the service must be viable because the buses are full at all times. An efficient and properly structured service will be successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">While I am supportive of State and semi-State enterprise I fear that anything that impinges on the provision of public services will damage them in the long run. For that reason I abhor all stoppages in the public transport service. I have stated this opinion to friends of mine who are involved in the trade union movement. A ludicrous situation was allowed to develop when a single employee brought the public transport system to an entire region of the west of Ireland to a halt. Such incidents help the case being made by those who want to see the private sector taking over. Every stoppage makes a significant impact. A major change is on the agenda which needs much discussion and debate. In this context, I appeal to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to make sure that people have a proper input regarding the future of their own jobs. Regular stoppages will cause those involved to lose credibility and the public will stop using the service. If a passenger is let down by a service and misses a doctor's appointment or some important engagement, even once, he or she will tend to revert to private transport. I would be sorry to see this happen because a good service is being provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Deputy Pat Breen referred to vandalism and this issue must be dealt with firmly. There was a time when trains pulling out of Heuston Station were vulnerable to missiles being thrown at them and debris being placed on the line. Special steps had to be taken to deter such vandalism. Any attempt to vandalise the railways must be regarded as a serious crime because the potential exists for hundreds of people to be killed. Activities such as laying logs on the line or jamming sleepers between rails must be treated as major crimes. Wherever such activity happens it must be followed up and the perpetrators dealt with. It is difficult enough for a rail company to transport passengers without having to deal with the added problem of vandalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The importance of the provision of a railway service to any given area cannot be overstated. Members will, of course, use this debate to argue for the needs of their own region. In the greater Cork area a Cork area strategic plan was recently carried out. I am a little concerned that the plan is based almost totally on a presumption that Iarnród Éireann will run new lines in east Cork through Carrigtwohill and Midleton to Youghal, and to Blarney, Monard and similar areas in the west of the county. Thousands of acres of land are involved and it is presumed that areas zoned for housing and for commercial and industrial development will be served by railway lines. A major survey was done in the past 12 months at the request of the Government and the Minister has received that survey. The provision of the railway line is such a vital ingredient in the success of the plan that if Iarnród Éireann was not to provide these new lines the plan would have to be scrapped. The plan is a joint city and county exercise and its success is extremely important. In the old west of the United States the railroad companies were able to create new towns and close down others almost overnight by the provision of freight and passenger services. The provision of a rail service is as important in Ireland today as it was in the United States 150 years ago. The CASP will lead to significant investment in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The spending of money on 26 new railway carriages in the past two and a half years shines a bright light but such developments come at a high price. I was interested to receive the correspondence from Mr. Barry Kenny, public relations manager with Iarnród Éireann, announcing an investment of €117 million for carriages for inter-city services. That is a large amount of money. Every mile of railway requires a massive investment. If we are to justify that kind of investment, we must have passengers. In the past we thought a commuter was a type of Dublin person but, by and large, every town and city has its commuters. It is a fact of life that people are moving out to smaller towns and villages and want to work in the major towns and cities. To facilitate commuters, a good public service is required. Existing services are being expanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">There were bad times in Iarnród Éireann and in public transport generally in the past. I was disappointed, because of the Abbeylara decision, that we were unable to complete the mini-CTC inquiry as what occurred certainly smacked of incompetence. It would be grossly unfair to tarnish Iarnród Éireann because of the negligence, incompetence and unbusiness-like approach of a small group. I cannot go too far into it because evidence was presented only up to a certain point. However, on the evidence presented, matters looked quite bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">As already stated, the people of Cork have their own shopping list in terms of the provision of new lines. However, we are also concerned about the failure to do anything with Ceannt station for many years. For the past 15 to 17 years, every person in Cork city who uses the station has to travel eight tenths of a mile from the front gate simply to get to town. If one is entering the station, one has to travel that eight tenths of a mile and then go east because of the one-way traffic system. The block on which the station is situated is eight tenths of a mile. That is criminal negligence not only Cork City Council but also by Iarnród Éireann, which has alternatives. The amount of money spent, the frustration suffered, etc., should not have been tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">In fairness to Iarnród Éireann, in recent years it has opened a second car park which allows people to cross over a bridge and drive back out of the station. By and large, however, 90% of those using the station for freight are losing eight-tenths of a mile and that cannot be tolerated in the context that taxpayers' money is being wasted. The difficulties at Ceannt station will have to be resolved without delay. The company probably has plans to rebuild. To resolve the problem, it is considering turning the buildings around so that the front of the station will face the River Lee.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In regard to the standard of safety, the worst aspect is the manifestation of a tolerance of overcrowding on the Dublin-Cork and Cork-Dublin train on Friday evenings. There is something wrong when people sit between carriages. On at least two of the evening trains there is a dining car which has never been used as a dining car because it is full before the train pulls out of the station. I cannot comment on the standard of the lines, but I welcome the fact that so many millions have been spent on providing continuous welded lines because that is the ultimate in rail safety. However, I am concerned at the numbers being packed into trains. It may be that people will have to be told they cannot travel on a particular train and that they will have to wait for another train in about an hour and a half or whatever. Safety should be of paramount importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I welcome the Bill and look forward to a full consolidation of the Railway Acts since 1836.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_545">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I consider it to be of great importance to the travelling public. CIE enjoys huge support from the travelling public. Increasing numbers of people are anxious to use the rail network because of the safety aspect at a time when more accidents are occurring on our roads. However, the position has changed somewhat in recent months with the introduction of the penalty points system. It is important that the Bill is before the House and that Members can contribute to it on behalf of the public, who have been so loyal to CIE over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The train service here has been overlooked and under-utilised for many years. In this city and in towns and cities across the country, thousands of people spend far too much time in their cars stuck in traffic. They waste precious natural resources in gridlock adding to air pollution and swapping family time for commuting time. For too long trains have taken a back seat to cars, buses and aeroplanes in our transport development programme. It is of paramount importance that the rail system is operated in accordance with the highest standards of safety for the travelling public. There is an opinion that the laws that oversee the operation of our railway system are out of date. I welcome the fact that the Bill is broad in its remit and covers not only the Iarnród Éireann network but Luas and the planned Metro network, heritage railways and other railways which have an interface with public roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">In these environmentally conscious times it would be well to remember the positive aspects associated with train travel. Train travel is significantly more environmentally friendly than most other forms of transport. Aeroplane travel causes more pollution per passenger mile than train travel. Some estimates indicate it is between three and eight times as much. Car travel also produces a higher level of pollution per passenger. It makes good sense to transport several hundred people at a time instead of each individual adding to gridlock and traffic chaos on our roads. If the public is offered a safe, reliable and pleasant alternative, essentially a train service in which it can have confidence, it will choose the train over the car.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Iarnród Éireann runs a television campaign which tells people it is time to take the train. It must also recognise it is time to offer a reliable and passenger-friendly service. Many of those travelling by train at weekends are packed in corridors and pay a huge price for the service. That is not good enough. We have all heard of older people standing in carriages. That is no way for a modern network to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The train network is useful not only for passenger transport but also for freight. There are a number of specific advantages in this regard. The presence of heavy goods vehicles on our roads should, if possible, be minimised. The consequences for a car user or cyclist who happens to have an accident with a heavy goods vehicle can be serious. During the past six years, 75% of bicycle fatalities in Dublin have involved collisions with heavy goods vehicles. By encouraging rail freight services, the Government would remove a certain number of heavy goods vehicles from our roads. This would have positive safety implications for road users and would also be environmentally friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">There are many instances of where we lost opportunities to transport goods by rail and I instance one such example which is a crying shame. In north Tipperary, Lisheen Mines transports its goods from Lisheen to the port through towns and villages along an already busy stretch of road. I do not know whether the planning authorities were responsible but more thought should have gone into this. These goods should be transported by rail rather than road, particularly since the Dublin-Cork railway line is so close to Lisheen Mines. The company was allowed to take a decision to transport goods by road but it should have been encouraged to transport them by rail. When giving out the mining licences, the Government or Tipperary county council should have looked at the rail network. It was a missed opportunity because those trucks are travelling hourly through towns and villages on an already busy route.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">If we examine the existing rail network, one can see the potential of freight transport. In my constituency, the rail network runs through Clonmel, Cahir and Tipperary providing a link between the important port of Rosslare and Limerick Junction where the network diverts to Cork, Tralee or Ennis. In this way, the rail network can provide an important freight link between the west and the east.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Recently, the rail line from Rosslare has been in the news. It is a railway line which is totally under exploited. There is significant potential for that rail network but it has a bad passenger service. I recently used that passenger service to see the situation first hand because I knew I would have the opportunity to speak about it in the House and that there was widespread concern in the constituency in regard to what was available. There is a bad service once a day for passengers travelling on that line. The train is in poor condition and it is not feasible for people who wish to travel regularly to use that network. The reason that network is closing is that its potential has not been exploited. I welcome the statement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in which he gave a commitment to the south-eastern region, particularly to that railway network.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I urge the Government to do what it can in this regard. It would be a crying shame if this generation of politicians allowed that wonderful infrastructure which serves the south-eastern region to close. There is significant support for it across the political spectrum and I welcome the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's commitment to it. I hope the Government will encourage Iarnród Éireann to keep that network open. It has significant potential and generations to come will criticise us or will see us as the generation which allowed that wonderful infrastructure to close. The south-eastern region needs that infrastructure. Towns such as Tipperary Town, one of the poorest in the country, are served by that network. I urge whoever makes the decision or whoever supports Iarnród Éireann to try to keep that network open because future generations will not thank us if it closes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_554">I thank Deputy Hayes for sharing his time. The title of this Bill indicates that safety is of paramount importance and cannot be overlooked. I am sure Iarnród Éireann, in its efforts, and modern technology continue to monitor the updating of safety equipment <i>vis-à-vis</i> trains and signalling equipment on the lines. No one wishes to see a train crash. Of all crashes, apart from those involving aircraft, train crashes result in the most loss of human life as we have seen recently in England where many such deaths have occurred. It is imperative that we keep rail safety at the top of the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Many Deputies spoke about the need to increase the number of services on the main lines which I support. To attract customers, it is essential that park and ride facilities are located at most stations. In my constituency of Kildare South, such facilities have been provided in Monasterevin and Kildare town and it is amazing to see the number of cars using them. I have seen some cars park outside the perimeters of the park and ride facilities thus causing traffic jams. Having said that, one can see the benefit of park and ride facilities to the areas. We must go further and provide park and ride facilities at other stations. It is certainly within the remit of Iarnród Éireann to continue to provide such facilities. In Athy, there is an area within the ownership of Iarnród Éireann in which it could provide more parking spaces to allow the people of Kildare South to use the rail service.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">In the next year, those who use the N7 will need such facilities in their areas because there will be new interchanges at Kill and Johnstown where there are traffic lights at present. Those lights are causing traffic mayhem every day. Today, it took me two and a half hours to make a 50 mile trip. One can imagine the problems which will be created when the road works start at these two locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">As I have said in the House before, there is a need for Iarnród Éireann and the National Roads Authority to get together to ensure the maximum number of services are provided during that period of refurbishment and the instigation of work at those two interchanges because, if not, there will be traffic mayhem on the dual carriage extending back to the motorway. That is happening at present in that there is a build up of cars back to the motorway thus causing problems in relation to speed and so on. People travelling on the motorway suddenly find cars and trucks stopped in front of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I hope the Minister, Deputy Brennan, will continue to put pressure on Iarnród Éireann to provide better park and ride facilities, especially in the provincial stations, and that the National Roads Authority will consult Iarnród Éireann on the provision of extra services given the forthcoming changes on the dual carriageway at Kill and Johnstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">We have spoken at length about the extension of the Arrow service. The provision of the Arrow and DART services have enabled people to leave their cars at home or at the station. This service must be extended to other areas. Deputies from Carlow and south Kildare have argued for an extension of the Arrow service to facilitate those areas. It is imperative to keep moving towards that objective and the same applies to the DART services which should be extended along the east coast, past Greystones to Arklow. That would ensure that the maximum number of people can avail of such rail services, thus reducing road usage.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Improved rail freight services have been called for. Regular road users can see the increase in freight vehicles which take up a huge amount of space and pose a danger to road safety. We must reconsider this matter. For a long time, CIE provided rail freight services to many towns where railway station staff were employed to load and unload goods, using a tractor and trailer. We should re-examine the possibility of providing such facilities again to reduce the number of enormous trucks using roads. A progressive rail freight service structure needs to be established to alleviate some of the current road traffic chaos.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The extension of Arrow and DART services has been mentioned at length but I am disappointed that the Luas service has been further delayed due to financial constraints. Given the proposed Luas routes through the city, one can see the major advantages it will provide when it is in operation. I understand that the Luas service is being extended to Dublin Airport but I wonder if Croke Park is to be included on that line? One can only have sympathy for residents in the Croke Park area which is obstructed on certain Sundays by parked cars. Park and ride facilities at Luas stations could alleviate the concerns of local residents there. I hope the Minister, Deputy Brennan, will create such linkages when the line opens because it would be of major significance for safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">We must continue to put pressure on Iarnród Éireann to provide special trains for all major sporting occasions. The company does not seem to realise the importance of providing such trains. I am aware that vandalism and hooliganism have occurred on trains but, in general, such trouble has not occurred on special trains catering for sporting events. I have travelled on many such trains. On one occasion, I travelled to a practice match in Tralee when two trainloads of supporters made the journey from Kildare. One can imagine the comradeship that was created on that occasion. We are in danger of neglecting these important factors, although special trains seem to have been making a comeback recently and we have had a number of them in Kildare over the past two or three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">They are of major significance, running from Kildare to Connolly Station from where it is easy to get to Croke Park. A full train might carry 1,000 supporters with fewer cars making the trip so the traffic flow can be improved in the city. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, must move that initiative forward with Iarnród Éireann so that sporting organisations, including the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA, will use trains to reduce gridlock on our roads. Residents around Croke Park and other venues should not have to suffer from excess traffic flows caused by supporters attending sports matches. Every available facility should be employed to alleviate the residents' problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The rural transport initiative should include a link-up between mainline rail, Arrow and DART services and the corresponding bus services. In that way, people from rural areas would be better able to access work and educational opportunities in urban areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">I welcome the Bill and take this opportunity to commend my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, on his role in the Department of Transport. I wish him well in his endeavours during the next four and a half years. Neither the Minister, Deputy McDaid, nor myself has to worry too much about rail safety, strikes or late arrivals because ultimately we do not have a rail service. My objective, therefore, is that the Bill's provisions should be extended to embrace much more than safety, including the upgrading of tracks. The legislation should examine the extension of the railway network into areas such as mine in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">It is unfortunate that it took a derailment in November 1997 for the issue of rail safety to be addressed. It is welcome, however, that the matter is now being examined and provided for in this Bill. No measure can be too great, particularly when one is dealing with public safety, and, given the numbers travelling by train, the safety issue cannot be taken lightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I am glad an independent statutory body, to be known as the railway safety commission, is to be established with powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement. As the Minister indicated in his speech, section 55 of the Bill covers the investigation of railway accidents. I was glad to see that the focus of such investigations will not necessarily be on criminal prosecution but improving railway safety by establishing the cause of such incidents and making recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in future. It is important to learn from mistakes that have occurred but it is equally important that under section 61 a tribunal of inquiry can be established following a serious railway incident. While it is preferable to try to prevent such incidents within the terms of this legislation, we must accept that derailments or other accidents happen and it is important to establish their causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The establishment of a formal safety management system is to be welcomed, with the new railway safety advisory council which will incorporate representatives of organisations with an interest in rail safety. Perhaps the council's remit could be widened to include the development of railway services, not only by extending lines and examining external safety issues, but also the operation of services provided on trains. This may not be appropriate to the legislation before us, but perhaps the Minister of State will revert to me on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The Government has shown it means business in relation to upgrading of the railways. The €546 million safety related investment programme initiated in March 1999 has been very important. A total of 246 miles of track has already been replaced with continuous welded rail and 371 level crossings have been dealt with appropriately. It is a very big investment which should not be undervalued. However, continued support is needed and I am glad the Minister is talking about reconvening a task force to continue the work. Too often when we do something, we congratulate ourselves and then forget that time never stands still and that we must always keep abreast of current issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I began by stating we do not have a train service in County Donegal. That is not to say I never use the train service. It can be a very pleasant experience to board a train to Cork, Limerick, Galway or wherever, sit back in a comfortable space and enjoy some refreshments, enjoy the countryside going past or do some work or read the paper. In that respect I get very jealous of other Deputies who arrive here on a Tuesday refreshed and ready for action whereas Deputies from my part of the country have been struggling through traffic for five or six hours and arrive far from refreshed. This discrimination must end.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">I would love to have the opportunity to come here in style on a train. We have an opportunity to provide such a service relatively easily. I have previously spoken to the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, is also the type of person who would advance this idea. There was significant Government and European investment in developing the Enterprise which is now a very good quality train service from Dublin to Belfast. Given that the two stations in Belfast are now linked, there is no reason we could not initiate a direct Dublin to Derry train service. I, and I believe the Minister, have had discussions with various Ministers for transport in the Northern Ireland Executive with a view to advancing this idea. I am aware that the Executive is badly underfunded in terms of railways and that much updating is needed. However, there have been moves to develop the infrastructure in terms of both the lines and the trains. I would love to think the possibility of developing a cross-Border train service could be raised at European level and funding made available if it is still an option. Significant moneys were available for that type of venture in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">There is no Luas in County Donegal. The Bill, therefore, has no relevance for us in that respect. However, I ask that the rural transport initiative be progressed because it provides huge opportunities for the Inishowen Peninsula which I represent. Other parts of County Donegal have applied for funds under the rural transport initiative and been successful. The options for public transport in constituencies such as mine are limited. It is important, therefore, to reach out and give people as many opportunities and alternatives for public transport as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I would wish the Minister to look also at the concept of North-South co-operation on rural infrastructure because ultimately rail development would take freight off the roads and ease traffic congestion. There is also the ongoing issue of the N2 and A5 routes. As a member of the North West Region Cross Border Group, I have met everybody from Malcolm Moss through to Peter Robinson. We have had great responses but very little action. While the Government's contribution to developing the roads as far as the Border has been relatively good, North-South co-operation should continue to be progressed, although I know that is difficult given that the Executive is not sitting at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">It was stated the air link from Dublin to Derry would not work but it is working extremely well. It was also said the car ferry across the Foyle would not work but it is extremely successful. Ventures such as North-South co-operation are vastly under-exploited. I would like to think that we will continue to meet this challenge and believe any obstacles can be overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">On a different issue, the first train on which I ever travelled was delayed because of a suicide. For a while the subject was to the fore in the press. I refer to it in the context of counselling for staff, particularly train drivers. At one stage it was very common, particularly in England, for people to commit suicide by jumping in front of trains. I read that there is a section of railway employment which deals with safety, particularly the issue of train drivers' fitness for work in terms of whether they are intoxicated and so on. However, the issue of counselling and support for people should they encounter serious incidents such as suicide should also be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">In County Donegal there is an opportunity to develop the railway heritage which is not being exploited. The Departments of Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism could link together to develop the railway heritage and reopen some of the railways that were closed. In a very good new development around Bushmills the old steam train has been brought back.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I ultimately want an all-Ireland train service and believe that would not be impossible. I urge the Minister to progress the issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_581">Rail safety legislation has not been properly updated since the foundation of the State. This has led to an untenable situation where Ireland's rail operating company, Iarnród Éireann, is responsible for all financial and economic elements of the company but also solely and completely responsible for operational rail safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I am delighted to welcome the forthcoming legislation which will see the formation of an independent regulatory body for rail safety in Ireland for the very first time. Ireland's rail network is linked in history and style to the much more extensive UK network, formerly known as British Rail. Most of what is our present day network was constructed under British rule. Railways in a recognisable form have been in existence since the early 19th century. To get a sense of the different scales of the two networks, there are many criteria which may be usefully compared. For example, the combined UK rail companies have more passenger journeys in a day than Iarnród Éireann has in a year. It is important to remember differences such as this when comparing safety records in terms of major accident-free years, for example. The fact that Ireland has not had a multiple-fatality derailment since the Cherryville Junction disaster on 21 August 1983 with seven passenger deaths is often alluded to by Iarnród Éireann as evidence of one of the best rail safety records in Europe. With increasing passenger numbers annually and a more frequent and extensive service planned under the national development plan, we must be ready to accept the increasing potential for serious accidents if our infrastructure, regulation, training and safety systems are not up to standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Regulation of Railways Acts, 1840, 1871 and 1889 were all introduced under British rule. The formation of the State created for the first time divergent legislation. The Railways Act, 1924 is still the most relevant legislation for the operation of all aspects of Ireland's railways. Even to the present day most legislation applicable to rail safety emanates from inquiries into accidents or, if we are lucky, near misses. A network our size would not have the potential for accidents that the bigger UK network would have. This has created a major problem in that fewer accidents lead to fewer inquiries. In the absence of regular independent inquiries into rail accidents, there has been no dynamic presence—</p>

          <p eId="para_586">The tourism policy review group, the membership of which has already been publicly announced, had its inaugural meeting on Tuesday last, 28 January 2003. In my address to the group, I indicated that I was pleased that such an eminent group of people had volunteered their services to help chart a new direction for Irish tourism. The group's main priorities will include an assessment of the performance and potential of the tourism sector, and the identification of the key elements of a strategy, both industry-led and Government-led, for the further sustainable development of tourism in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The terms of reference for the review have been agreed and if the Deputy so wishes, I can arrange for a copy to be made available to him. As already outlined, in response to Parliamentary Question No. 51 of 20 November 2002, the terms of reference for this project have had to be carefully scoped, given the broad range of external influences on the development of tourism and in light of consultations with tourism industry representatives through the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">While my stated preference has been for an early completion date for its final report, I will be guided by the group whose members were appointed because of their broad mix of expertise and experience and who are best placed to decide how long they need to complete their task efficiently and effectively. In any event, I have requested that the group report to me with initial views by the end of April if at all possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">As there is a major question about the competitiveness of Irish tourism, will the Minister ask the review group to look at this issue. Given the increase in VAT, Ireland now has one of the highest VAT rates on hotel products in Europe. The weakening of the American dollar <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro by 20% over the past six months makes Ireland an expensive location for American tourists. The increase of 200% in insurance costs in some instances and the increase in local authority rates and charges means that Irish tourism is losing its competitiveness on a daily basis. Will the Minister ask the review group to look at Ireland's competitiveness, which is very important?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_590">One of the issues the review group will examine will be the question of competitiveness. It is true that people purchasing Irish holidays abroad purchase them at rates which are relatively equivalent to other northern European destinations. The difficulty appears to be that when people arrive in this country they find certain items do not offer value for money. The recent Bord Fáilte survey established that many people felt food and drink did not offer value for money. These will be among the items addressed by the review group.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">In view of the fact that a number of operators had entered into contractual arrangements prior to the budget and are now being forced to absorb the new VAT rate, will the Minister ask the Minister for Finance to introduce transitional arrangements so that the old VAT rate will apply to pre-contracted business? The weakening of the dollar and the fact that the industry will have to absorb the new VAT rate will put the tourism industry under a great deal of pressure.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">I have asked the Minister for Finance to consider the question of transitional arrangements for the tourism sector in light of the fact that many people would have entered into contractual arrangements. On a previous occasion when the VAT rate was increased, transitional arrangements were made. On this occasion, however, the Minister for Finance has indicated that since the increase is relatively marginal at 1%, he could not justify transitional arrangements. I am not optimistic at this stage that he will change his mind. He will publish the Finance Bill soon and I am not optimistic in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">The review group, which comprises a wide variety of people from different backgrounds, carries with it a great deal of expertise. I anticipate they will have a great knowledge of the industry. However, the group will liaise with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and others involved in the industry and, where relevant, consultancies will be made available to the group.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">It is important to point out that Ireland's tourism industry has increased by leaps and bounds in the past ten years. In 2001, for the first time ever, more than six million people visited Ireland. It is a fact that the recorded amount of revenue generated in the past year was of the order of €4 billion in foreign revenue and approximately €1.28 billion in domestic revenue, with 150,000 people involved in the industry. During the period in question there has been an investment between the public and private sector in building up the product of the order of €4.3 billion. In these circumstances the time is now ripe for us to consider where we are going with Irish tourism.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_598">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The Government decided last September that it was not in a position in current budgetary circumstances to provide Exchequer funding for the development of a national stadium. Accordingly, late last year it invited expressions of interest in the procurement of a privately-funded stadium at Abbotstown. The inter-agency group set up under the direction of my Department to evaluate the 23 expressions of interest recently completed its preliminary assessment of the responses received. I am currently reflecting on the issues raised in the group's report and it is my intention to discuss them with my Cabinet colleagues in the very near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Abbotstown remains my preferred option for the location of a stadium. Validation of Abbotstown as the most suitable location was provided by the results of a comprehensive survey of more than 20 potentially available sites carried out under the aegis of my Department in August 2002. This survey ranked the site at Abbotstown ahead of the others, many of which were located at centre-city locations, in terms of cost and general suitability.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The failure of the Scotland-Ireland bid to host the Euro 2008 Championships has had no material bearing on the development of a stadium. In the context of finalising the joint bid to UEFA by Scotland and Ireland, the Government agreed that in the event that the bid was successful it would seek the approval of the Oireachtas to provide financial support to help either upgrade capacity at Lansdowne Road or provide equivalent capacity at an alternative venue to be provided by the IRFU, which would not just comply with the international rugby requirements of the IRFU but meet with the standards of UEFA for hosting major events. As the bid was unsuccessful, that commitment no longer arises. Nevertheless, the requirement of both the IRFU and the FAI for a modern stadium capable of accommodating their prestige international fixtures which existed prior to the submission of the joint Scotland-Ireland bid for the 2008 UEFA finals, remains as pressing as ever and is central to my consideration of issues around the development of a stadium. I should also advise the Deputies that I am acutely aware of the needs of both the FAI and the IRFU for a modern stadium to play their international matches.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply to this contentious question. Is there a difference of opinion within the Government in relation to the site at Abbotstown <i>vis-à-vis </i>the city centre? Newspaper reports suggest that the Progressive Democrats Party favours a site near the city centre, whereas Fianna Fáil favours the Abbotstown location. On the last occasion that the Minister was in the House for Question Time I asked him about Croke Park and he informed me that a proposal had been put to the GAA authorities. Has there been any response to the Taoiseach's initiative at the time about the use of Croke Park? Is it still the case that we must wait until the GAA holds its congress in April? The Minister stated previously that arrangements would be made if the bid to host the 2008 tournament was successful. Is that still an option, as it seems sensible to keep all alternatives in mind? If the public private partnership approach to Abbotstown is not pursued, will the Minister look for Oireachtas approval for the alternative approach of which he spoke when we were bidding to host the 2008 tournament?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_603">The expert group which examined the possible sites for the proposed national stadium decided that Abbotstown was the preferred location for several reasons. It is also my personal preferred option. There have been no changes in relation to Croke Park – any proposal to change the association's rule 42 would have to be discussed at a congress of the GAA. It should be pointed out, however, that the GAA was asked by the Government for the use of Croke Park for four games during the 2008 European soccer championships in the event of the joint Ireland-Scotland bid being successful. The GAA can make its own decision in relation to Croke Park but a separate national stadium will have to be constructed in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">As a location, Croke Park presents certain difficulties in terms of planning, floodlighting, the objections of local residents and the overlapping of fixtures in the various sporting codes. Regardless of whether Croke Park is opened to other sports, there can be no doubt that Ireland requires an alternative stadium to host international soccer and rugby matches, in particular. I believe it will be possible to proceed with the national stadium, even if the proposed public private partnership does not go ahead. I am considering a number of other options and intend to bring proposals to Cabinet in the near future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_605">It is obvious that the impasse is continuing. The Minister has confused the matter further with his remarks in the House. Recent newspaper stories have reflected the spin being fed to various journalists. It has been suggested that the FAI and the IRFU have agreed, in principle, to co-fund a stadium with the State. Another report has indicated that the Abbotstown project is likely to be pursued in full. Does the Minister agree that it is time for the Government to make a clear decision? He has said he is looking at a number of options other than those examined by the review group. Is it not time to choose an option rather than dragging the matter on still further? I am sure the Minister realises that the IRFU and the FAI are getting impatient. I ask him to be more definite in his remarks. Does the fact that Abbotstown is his preferred location rule out the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road? Has the Government ruled out a city centre location? If the Minister made clear that Abbotstown is to be the location, we could start to debate the type of operation and who will construct it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_606">The inter-agency panel had to consider all the expressions of interest and it is fair to say the process took longer than I anticipated. There were complexities in relation to the expressions of interest, as certain parties asked about tax breaks, additional land and tax reliefs. We will have to decide what we are going to do soon. I do not accept that the process has been dragged out or that there has been an attempt to delay it, as the truth is that expressions of interest had to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Certain problems would be encountered if Lansdowne Road was to be refurbished. The stadium would have to be turned at a 90º angle which may cause local residents in the Lansdowne Road area to object to the planning proposals. In short, it may not be possible to construct a large new stadium at the IRFU's Lansdowne Road site.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Matters are becoming more urgent – Lansdowne Road can hold 49,000, of whom 24,000 are seated on permanent seats. In 2004, however, UEFA and FIFA will insist that all spectators are accommodated on permanent seating at international matches under their aegis. It has been possible until now to place 11,000 temporary seats at Lansdowne Road, giving the stadium a capacity of 35,000 for all-seater international soccer matches. When the new rule comes into force in 2004, it will not be permissible to place temporary seating on the terraces, thereby reducing the capacity to 24,000 for FAI games. I do not believe such a low capacity would be economically viable. It has to be said that while Lansdowne Road is rich in tradition, the stadium is dilapidated and the pitch worsening. The IRFU faces financial difficulties as a result of the introduction of the professional rugby union. If a stadium with a capacity of 65,000 was made available to the IRFU, the union's financial position would be considerably strengthened and its pressures eased.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The case made by the FAI and the IRFU is irrefutable – there is a clear need for a new stadium. The Government needs to recognise that need and examine how the issues faced by the sports organisations can be resolved. I intend to finalise proposals in relation to a new facility soon. They will have to be brought to Government for its views and then the House for its assessment of the issues involved.</p>

      <b>Mr. Gregory</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
      his plans for a docklands site for the national sports centre; the funding sources available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_611">There are no plans under consideration to site a new national stadium in any location on the docklands, or in any place other than at the State owned site at Abbotstown. The Deputy will recall that when expressions of interest in a privately funded national stadium were invited late last year, it was clearly stipulated that the stadium would be located at Abbotstown. A working group under the direction of my Department had previously undertaken an assessment of all potential locations for the national stadium, including a number of dockland sites. The site at Abbotstown was placed well ahead of the other sites considered in terms of general suitability, including availability and cost considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">As I have already told the House today, the interagency group set up to evaluate the expressions of interest in developing a privately funded stadium has recently completed its preliminary assessment of the responses received. I am currently reflecting on the issues involved and intend to discuss them with my Cabinet colleagues shortly. I do not intend making a statement in this regard until my Government colleagues have had an opportunity to consider and approve a strategy to meet our stadium requirements in the most advantageous and cost-efficient way. The question of finance will be dealt with in this context.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_613">I am sure that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be very disappointed to hear that. I was not recommending a docklands site, merely looking for information because of various media reports. It does appear that Abbotstown is the chosen site, but if there are alternative sites to be considered, will the Minister ensure that the concerns of communities and residents in the areas are taken into consideration? I can speak with experience on this because I live in the shadow of Croke Park. Residents in an ever-increasing area around the stadium are prisoners in their own homes on major match days. The Minister referred earlier to the possible expansion of activities at Croke Park. Would he agree that the concerns of residents must be taken into account by the authorities there and by him in making any decision on the location of a stadium? Will the Minister indicate which private developers made approaches in relation to funding for the national stadium?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_614">The views of residents must certainly be taken into account during the development of any new stadium. I am aware of the difficulties experienced by residents around Croke Park on occasion. There is no question of the stadium's proceeding at a city centre location without negotiations with local residents. However, as I have already stated, the expert group that looked at all of the relevant sites came to the conclusion that Abbotstown was the most suitable site for several reasons, some of which I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Deputy inquired about developers who expressed an interest in the project. The evaluation of all of these has now been completed and it is possible that the list will be published in due course.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_616">Will the Minister confirm that Treasury Holdings was one of the developers which expressed an interest in funding the stadium? It certainly appears to be on friendly terms with the Fianna Fáil branch of the Government. It could probably pay for the entire project out of a small proportion of its huge profits.</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_617">Deputy Gregory has his own views, which I am not likely to change by anything I say. There were many valid expressions of interest. Irrespective of how we proceed, there will be no question, for example, of the State transferring land at Abbotstown or anywhere else at a cost to the taxpayer, whose interests will be borne in mind at all times.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">Under the local authority swimming pool programme 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study: preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers at the Office of Public Works evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to €3,809,214 are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. In the case of the north-east swimming pool project, the preliminary report was approved in January 2001. My Department is awaiting the submission of contract documents by Fingal County Council for the proposed facility. On receipt of this documentation, the proposal will be considered further.</p>

I understand there might be a need to renew the correspondence as there has been none recently. The Minister's predecessor had a three-year allocation of €42 million for swimming pool projects, less than half of which was taken up. Is there a use to which that money can be put, or is it gone from the Department – lost to various projects? This project has been struggling for ten years and has raised €500,000 to date. I would appreciate if the Minister could indicate whether there is any possibility of a meeting with officials in his Department to discuss the future of this project, as it needs an exchange of information to take it to its next stage.</p>

If there is any assistance my Department can provide to the county council we will be only too happy to do so. The allocation for the swimming pool projects in 2000-2002 was €57 million and the unused portion has not been lost. There are about 43 projects in the pipeline and it is anticipated that all the allocated amount will be taken up, albeit in stages over a number of years.</p>

Would his officials be willing to set aside half an hour to meet the committee dealing with the project and discuss what is available, what needs to be done and where there is any difficulty that can be overcome? There has been a considerable amount of voluntary fund-raising and a number of people have put much effort and money into bringing the project so far.

Grantees must meet the requirements as directed by my Department in accordance with the programme's guidelines, terms and conditions and payments are made on foot of required documentation and invoices or certificates of payment received, which must be for work beginning after the date of grant allocation. In 2002, payments amounting to over €43.2 million were made by my Department to projects which were allocated grants under the programme in 2002 and in previous years. This represents an increase of 60% on the 2001 total of almost €27 million and an increase of some 440% on the 2000 total of just over €8 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">I do not wish to query the concept of the grants. I fully appreciate that many clubs and associations benefit from them each year. However, I am concerned about whether funding is being invested in deprived areas. In many instances, clubs are cherrypicking the best of the youth in a particular area and leaving problems behind. Does the Minister propose to review the guidelines to see if the grant system has been successful in terms of what was originally envisaged? We all know the benefits it has brought – I am not arguing about them – but I wonder if we are getting to the root of problems in society. Are we providing facilities to deal with that or are these grants not applicable to this purpose?</p>

          <p eId="para_629">As I have already indicated, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of grant aid being made available. Since 1998, the amount of grant aid has reached some €213 million. With regard to whether or not it is getting into deprived areas and areas of disadvantage, we have decided to have a review of the scheme and an audit of the facilities. This is being done with a view to seeing where gaps exist and whether and how they can be filled. Once this group has carried out its review, we will probably embark on a strategic plan which will enable us to reach the objective to which Deputy Wall aspires.</p>

      <b>Mr. Stanton</b>
      asked the

      if he will make funding available to enable a swimming pool to be constructed in Cobh, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [2129/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_362">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_642">Under the local authority swimming pool programme 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender; and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Grants of up to €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">As indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 321 of 19 November 2002 on this subject, my Department has been advised by the Office of Public Works to await the appointment of a pool operator, as envisaged by Cobh Town Council, before processing the Cobh application further. This is to ensure that any changes to the proposed facility required by the pool operator can be incorporated prior to approval of tenders. The proposal will be considered further on receipt of this additional information.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_645">I thank the Minister for his reply, although it is the standard response to all questions on swimming pools. Is he aware that Cobh pool closed in 1985 and that in 1995 the estimated cost of constructing a pool was £1.7 million; in 1997, £2.7 million; in 2000, £5.4 million; in 2001, £7.6 million and in 2002, €7.8 million? Will the Minister examine the procedures involved in constructing public pools, because this is surely a scandal? People have been waiting for 12 years or longer for a pool to be constructed and nothing has happened. Is the Minister aware there are 12,000 people on the island of Cobh, which lacks a cinema, a youth club, sports facilities and a swimming pool? Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, contact Cobh Town Council, talk to people in his Department and see if this project can be expedited as soon as possible?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_646">The delay is not on our side. My information indicates that we have been advised to await the appointment of a pool operator by Cobh Town Council but it has not done so. We will write to the council to ask when it is going to appoint the pool operator and perhaps the Deputy might contact it also.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_647">Does the Minister not agree that it is a scandal that this pool closed in 1985 and that he has some responsibility to ensure that the people get the facilities that are needed? There is a huge need for this project to go ahead in Cobh. Money has been collected over the years, but there have been administrative delays. It seems that as soon as the town council satisfies one condition another is thrown at them. This has happened on numerous occasions. Will the Minister investigate the unacceptable delays because the costs are mounting, making it almost impossible for the local authority to match the funding? Will he give a commitment to examine this swimming pool programme because Deputies from all sides of the House are concerned at the delays, given that costs are increasing all the time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_648">The problem is that it is not the Department's fault. I suspect the major delay was the fact that there was no funding for swimming pools up to 2000, when this programme was introduced. At that stage, around €57 million was made available. Cobh submitted a proposal for a pool, the cost of which is around €7.64 million and – while the contract documents for the project were approved in December 2000 and tender documents were received in December 2001 – the Office of Public Works advised my Department that it should not proceed until Cobh Town Council had appointed a pool operator. This was to ensure that any changes to the proposed facility required by the pool operator could be incorporated prior to approval of the tenders. If we receive the information we will proceed. There is no point in my taking the blame for something for which I am not responsible.</p>

It is quite straightforward and it does not matter when, how or where. I have outlined the advice of the Office of Public Works and given the Deputy the reasons for it. The best approach at this stage would be for Cobh Town Council to go ahead and appoint a pool operator. Deputy Stanton might be better engaged taking this matter up with the council.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_661">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11, 15, 19, 23 and 29 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The tourism industry is one of the great success stories of the modern Irish economy and it is essential that it continues to prosper. The performance of Irish tourism during the 1990s has rightly been described as spectacular. The reality today, however, is that there have been significant and quite rapid changes in the industry, the business environment and visitors' expectations and perceptions. We are facing more intensive competition and our competitiveness is under threat, as is the traditional uniqueness of the Irish holiday offering.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Obviously it is critical that our tourism product remains competitive in international terms. While pricing is important, it is not necessarily the key issue as Ireland has never been marketed as a cheap mass tourism destination. Value for money and quality are the key issues and I have consistently warned that the industry must guard against complacency.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I have said before that there is evidence from research conducted by Bord Fáilte that there is a deterioration in perceptions of value for money among visitors to Ireland, particularly from mainland Europe. The recent appreciation of the euro presents further challenges. Visitor concern with price levels here appears to relate primarily to the cost of goods and services consumed by them when they arrive rather than the price of holiday offers, access or accommodation. There is simply no refuting the fact that inflation rates in the restaurants, hotels and licensed premises sector and in the recreation and culture category are running well ahead of national figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">While the Government and its agencies have a role to play in supporting the further development of the sector, the tourism industry itself has primary responsibility for keeping prices in check. It must do all in its power to control costs, improve productivity, better manage its human resources and utilise modern technology to best advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Government will continue to play its part in supporting the industry through a range of programmes and measures in the product development, marketing, training and human resource areas. I will be looking, in particular, to the new National Tourism Development Authority to bring forward new thinking to help the tourism sector to confront some of the new challenges which it faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Deputies will be also be aware that recovering competitiveness, both within the domestic economy and on the international stage, is central to the overall macroeconomic policy of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth and that a number of key actions have been identified in the current talks on a new social partnership agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Given the general trends that have emerged over the past two tourism seasons, it was clear that the policies that served us well in the 1990s may not be the most appropriate for today, and that we had reached a point where it was time for a major review of tourism. With the approval of my colleagues in Government, and supported by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, I have appointed a tourism policy review group, including representatives from the private and public sectors and from within and outside the tourism industry to chart a new direction for Irish tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">As I indicated already in reply to the earlier priority question, the terms of reference for the review have been agreed by the group and can be made available to Deputies if they so wish. These will confirm that the issues of value for money, price competitiveness and sustainability, raised in this series of questions addressed to me today, will be covered in the review.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I propose to take all the questions together.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I am informed by the Garda Síochána that, following an initial call received by ambulance control, gardaí from Roxborough Road Garda station in Limerick went to a place known as Lickadoon, Drombanna, situated three miles south of Limerick city. There, along the side of a quiet country road, they found the body of a male whom they recognised as Ciaran Keane of Greenhills Road, Garryowen, County Limerick, born 3 June 1966. His hands had been bound behind his back and he had gunshot wounds to his head. Gardaí then established that a man known as Owen Treacy of 96, St. Munchin's Street, born 1972, had called to a local house in the area nearby, suffering from multiple stab wounds to his upper body. His hands were also bound with tape. He was removed to Limerick Regional Hospital where he is being treated for his injuries. He has multiple stab wounds to his upper body as well as a punctured lung and a deep wound to his neck. I understand his injuries are not life-threatening. Subsequently, Ciaran Keane's car was found at Fairgreen in Limerick and has been preserved for technical examination, as has a private house.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">During the course of the night gardaí in Portlaoise Garda station received a 999 call shortly after 3 a.m. from a male person claiming to be one of the Ryans from Limerick. Gardaí from Portlaoise went to an area outside the town, and there they met two brothers, Kieran and Eddie Ryan. They were taken to Portlaoise Garda station and the Ryan family was notified subsequently by gardaí at Portlaoise. Both were taken subsequently to Henry Street Garda station in Limerick by gardaí from that station. Gardaí carried out inquiries and a series of searches during the night and these have led to the arrest of two persons, both under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act. That is the current position as I have been informed by the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Recent activities in Limerick and Dublin resulting in the violent deaths of three men are a matter of serious public concern. I very much share that concern, as do all Members of this House. The outrages in question have been notable in particular for their brutality and inhumanity. The abduction and detention of the two young men from Limerick to whom I have just referred, allied to the suffering caused to their immediate family, is totally unacceptable in a civilised society and I will not tolerate it. It is a matter of relief for their family, all humane persons and Deputies in this House that these two young men have returned unharmed. That relief is, however, tempered and put in perspective by the fact that one man was brutally murdered overnight while another was seriously injured in the manner I have described.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">There have been violent crimes of a similar nature in Dublin over the past week, which have resulted in two deaths, more grieving families and a heightened sense of concern among the community at large about crime. I met with Commissioner Patrick Byrne and Deputy Commissioner Noel Conroy of the Garda this morning to discuss these recent criminal outrages. I had been in contact with them before, but this morning I had a lengthy meeting. The preliminary indications are that some of these criminal offences come within the category of what is called organised criminal activity, gangland or group activity, although these are terms which are not used by the Garda generally speaking to categorise individual offences. Having spoken with the Garda, I am absolutely satisfied that the necessary resources are being directed toward the containment and detection of these crimes and this pattern of offences. I have confirmed to the Garda my willingness to pursue any other measures which would assist it in addressing any problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Terminology such as "gangland killing", "organised crime" and "group crime" is widely used by the media and others to refer to the nature of crimes such as those perpetrated in the last week. This is understandable, but it does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda classifies crime. All murders and violent crimes are subject to detailed investigation regardless of the circumstances in which they occurred. In that context, just as nobody is above the law, nobody is beneath the law. The fact that a person may or may not be a member of or associated with a group or organisation in any community either in Dublin or anywhere else does not mean his or her life is cheaper in the eyes of the law or that the gravity of any offence committed against him or her is lessened.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">It is the world-wide experience of crimes linked to organised criminal activity that it is notoriously difficult to bring perpetrators to justice. However, on the basis of the full and detailed briefing I received from the Garda this morning, I can say that significant progress is being made in these cases. Persons have been arrested in connection with Garda investigations in Limerick. Indeed, persons are already before the courts facing serious charges arising from some of the present criminal activities. In these circumstances, Deputies will understand that I do not wish to comment in any way on the specific detail of Garda investigations into the recent incidents lest I prejudice their successful outcome or a subsequent prosecution or trial. I am determined that criminal activity of the type recently seen will be tackled with all the resources and all the capacity at the State's disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The Garda has already taken specific additional measures in the Limerick area and will continue to take a proactive approach to ensure that all such outrages are prevented, detected and punished to the greatest possible extent. I have huge faith in Chief Superintendent Kelly who is in charge of the Garda in Limerick. He is a man of great capacity. I met him recently, prior to these most recent events and in the wake of the heinous killing of Brian Fitzgerald. I had an in-depth discussion with him about the problems he faces in Limerick. Equally, I have much faith in Assistant Commissioner Culligan who has travelled to Limerick today and who has deployed in the Limerick area armed detectives from the Cork division. These are matched by the emergency response unit elements who travelled from Dublin in the early hours of this morning to be on duty in Limerick to prevent any further crime.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_682">We have all witnessed the scenario of the last week during which a city in fear and horror was almost held to ransom by criminal elements. It is with a sense of relief that we see the two young brothers are free and have returned home safe and apparently healthy. Another callous murder has taken place and the feuding continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The latest figures show a 62% increase in homicides, approximately 30% of which were committed in Limerick and 40% in Dublin. Dublin has a worse proportionate crime rate than London and Limerick has a much worse rate again. Should this not have drawn the Minister's attention to dealing with the issue of serious violent crime, particularly homicide, long before now? There has been a record increase of 93% in the violent crime figures and that should have sounded warning bells. Does the Minister agree that there has been no policy of zero tolerance? Instead, there seemed to be a policy of maximum tolerance. When Brian Fitzgerald was killed in a very professional manner the warning lights should have flashed. He was a man who worked in security guarding against drugs coming into a nightclub. A policy should have been put in place to deal with what was clearly an escalation in violent crime in the Limerick area.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Would it not have been appropriate for the Minister to have called upon the Minister for Finance to provide the funding for the 2,000 gardaí which the Government parties promised separately in their manifestos and collectively in the programme for Government? At the last moment, the Minister announces today the recruitment of 350 gardaí already approved under the cap put in place by the Minister for Finance. That is a long way from the 2,000 gardaí required. When the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors stated there were not enough resources to deal with the problems in Limerick, the Minister should have taken action rather than listen to his Minister of State who said he was in control. He said he had contacted the Garda and found everything to be fine. The world and its mother, with the exception of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Minister of State, knew what was happening but no action was ever taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">We have the worst track record of violent crime in the history of the State, yet all we get from the Minister is inertia. Will the Minister indicate what he intends to do about the problem? He announced that the ERU has travelled to Limerick and that gardaí will be recruited, but what will he do to reassure the citizens of Limerick and Dublin, where there were two gangland killings already this week, that he can deal with this matter? We are told again and again that homicides are being dealt with effectively and that there is a good detection rate. Of the 62 homicides which took place last year, we are sure that eight are so-called gangland killings. I do not like to use the term either, although it is the common one employed by the media. Not one person has been charged in relation to those eight murders. Nobody is able to deal with the serious gangland assassinations which are taking place and there is effective immunity for those who commit them. They are operating with impunity and are virtually untouchable. No category of crime can be untouchable. That was the case up to the time of the Veronica Guerin murder and it is now the case in relation to drugs that millionaires are being created from the profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The stakes are so high that professional assassins are operating and there is a lack of willingness, ability and leadership to ensure that this category of crime is dealt with. That is my real concern. There is no blueprint, policy or particular response from the Minister or the Garda to deal with this. Until we see that those who were assassinated during the week in Dublin and the person who was assassinated in Limerick—</p>

          <p eId="para_695">I became fully aware of the crime problem in Limerick from Chief Superintendent Kelly who explained to me in detail the problem in areas of the city and his difficulties in dealing with specific aspects of criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I agree with the Deputy that there has been a pattern of homicides in Limerick. However, the Garda has detected and arrested an unprecedented number of people and there is a high success rate in this area. It is bringing prosecutions in murder cases before the Central Criminal Court to such an extent that over the next 18 months many gardaí will be deployed in Dublin as witnesses. In view of this I am contemplating whether it would be possible or appropriate to move the Central Criminal Court to Limerick to ensure the resource problem arising from this will not reduce the strength of Garda protection in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">An additional 41 gardaí have been assigned to Limerick city since the two Government parties took office. The total number of members of the Garda Síochána has increased from 10,800 when the Deputy's party was last in office to 11,900 today. It will further increase to 12,200. The Deputy implied that I was for the first time announcing today that Garda strength would increase to this figure. That is not true. The record of the House shows that on the last occasion the Deputy was present for a debate on this issue I made it clear I would increase the recruitment level to 12,200, notwithstanding—</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_708">Members on this side of the House share the Minister's genuine concern about this situation. However, during the week conflicting messages were issued by management sources, the Government and the Garda Síochána about what was happening in Limerick. A couple of days ago the Minister acknowledged there was a problem, yet the Minister of State at his Department said extra resources were not needed. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has stated there are not enough gardaí to respond to calls from members of the public who have been victimised. The Garda Commissioner said resources were not the problem and that sometimes better management was required. What did he mean by this? Perhaps the Minister should remind him that he is the chief manager.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The Minister referred to the concern expressed by Chief Superintendent Kelly about the serious drain of gardaí – I understand he mentioned a figure of 18 – who will have to travel to Dublin to appear before the Central Criminal Court in connection with the high number of detections. He asked that the Central Criminal Court be also situated in Limerick. In the meantime hundreds of members of the southern command are located in the Limerick area in addition to the emergency response unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Minister said 41 extra gardaí have been deployed in Limerick but it is not enough. The overtime budget for the Garda Síochána has been cut from €65 million to €50 million. The overall increase in the operational budget has increased by 2% but given the inflation rate of 5% this amounts to a real cut of 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">There are not enough resources to address this problem. More are required to deal with the high level of crime and the extraordinary nature of it in Limerick. Surely there is now proof of this. Before the last general election the Government promised that an additional 2,000 gardaí would be recruited. The Minister has reneged on this and must be accountable when situations like this occur and the Garda representative associations make it clear they do not have the numbers on the ground. This is not rocket science. They are publicly crying out for help but not getting adequate resources. Will the Minister answer this? I am trying to approach this problem in a fair manner. Members of the public and the Garda Síochána are telling me that Garda numbers are insufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The Deloitte &amp; Touche study undertaken for the National Bureau of Crime Investigation recommended that a unit be established to deal with organised crime. The Minister referred to gangland crime. Will he implement this recommendation and ensure it co-ordinates the activities of members of the Garda Síochána?</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Does the Minister consider it appropriate for the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy O'Dea, to offer to act as an intermediary with known criminals? His job is to prosecute the law as opposed to appeasing known violent criminals. Does the Minister think this has compromised Deputy O'Dea's position as a Minister of State, notwithstanding that he is a local representative?</p>

          <p eId="para_718">The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has, as any person of political prominence in any community would have done with regard to a situation in which it was evident that a number of people were engaging in tit-for-tat violence, offered moral leadership to the people involved to bring that to an end. He does so in his capacity as a leader of public opinion and as a Deputy for Limerick city. He does not do so in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I want to get across the message in the strongest possible terms that this spiral of retaliatory violence must stop now. The assistance of anybody, be it a clergyman, a leader of a local community, a national representative or a person who can bring moral authority and experience of their local community to assist in that process, is welcome. However, there is no question of any mediation or persuasion standing between the prosecution of offences and their detection on one hand and those who would commit them on the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">To be fair, Deputy O'Dea has never suggested that he would do a deal or in some sense compromise the activities of the Garda Síochána. On the contrary, he said he would use his position as an elected leader within his community – I assume most Deputies from Limerick would join him in this – to use whatever offices he could to dissuade whatever foolish and distorted individuals who might be tempted to further ratchet up the cycle of violence – rather than facing up to the fact that murder is a heinous crime – from doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I have already said that Garda numbers have risen in Limerick. I have spoken to Chief Superintendent Kelly about the deployment of his men. He brought to my attention the problem of having gardaí attend trials in Dublin and the drain that constitutes in light of the Garda's huge and spectacular success in bringing to prosecution many persons accused of serious crimes. I am taking every step possible to ensure that the administration of justice does not suck resources away from Limerick in the way the chief superintendent fears it might.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The issue in Limerick has never been a matter of numbers. If Chief Superintendent Kelly had informed me or Commissioner Byrne that, over and above any other part of the country – Deputy Costello referred to Dublin in this regard – more gardaí must be deployed in Limerick, I would have, because resources are resources no matter where they are deployed—</p>

Commissioner Byrne fully understands his responsibilities and has to engage in a complex task of moving resources, financial and human, here and there within the country to confront the crime threat as it exists and as it changes over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Finian McGrath – the flooding crisis on the Tolka river, the need for dredging and the construction of flood prevention walls along the river; (2) Deputy Finneran – the need for the Government to address the employment crisis in the Roscommon-Longford constituency as a result of major job losses at Precision Castings, Roscommon town, Elan Pharmaceuticals, Monksland, south Roscommon, Glanbia Meats, Rooskey, County Roscommon and Square D, Ballinasloe; (3) Deputy Gogarty – the need to review the current proposal to locate a place of detention, headquarters and ancillary facilities at Newlands, Clondalkin; and (4) Deputy Broughan – the urgent need to provide for St. Michael's House to provide services for citizens with intellectual disability on the north side of Dublin.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Job Losses.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_431">
          <from>Mr. Finneran</from>
          <p eId="para_754">I welcome the Minister. I call on the Government to address the employment crisis in the Roscommon-Longford constituency as a result of major job losses at a number of factories in County Roscommon and in Ballinasloe, County Galway. Some 1,125 jobs have been lost to this region since January 2001. Irish Gloves in Roscommon town closed at the beginning of 2001 with the loss of 30 jobs. A total of 50 jobs were lost at Mayo Workwear, Castlerea, at the same time, while 30 were lost at Precision Casting in Roscommon town in June 2001. Some 280 jobs were lost at Glanbia in Rooskey as a result of fire; 70 people were working in a cannery and 120 were redeployed. In fact, 470 jobs have been disrupted, with 280 lost. Elan Pharmaceuticals, Monksland, south Roscommon, shed 350 jobs in August 2002 and 385 jobs were lost at Square D in Ballinasloe in January 2003. That makes a total of 1,125 jobs lost to this region in just over a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">I do not know of any other region which could absorb those losses. A difficult aspect for a public representative from that area is that it is ten years since IDA Ireland provided a job in the area. I call on the Government and the statutory agencies to address the serious jobs crisis in County Roscommon and the adjoining counties of east Galway, Longford, Leitrim and Westmeath. Job losses have affected all this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The area, particularly Roscommon town and the major towns of County Roscommon, have been neglected by the agencies which have a responsibility for job creation. Is there any other county which has not had an IDA Ireland job provided in the past ten years, as is the case in County Roscommon? I ask the Minister to ensure that the responsible agencies make a special effort regarding our county, address the question of job losses and not allow a flight from the county. We have a decreasing population in the north-west of the county and we need the full attention of the job creating agencies and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">We are in the BMW region but this is nothing more than a paper exercise as far as extra jobs are concerned. There are two opportunities which must be grasped by the Government. First, the policy decision that 50% of all jobs brought into the country should be brought to the BMW region must be put into effect. Roscommon must be given priority and provided with an opportunity to get jobs either through IDA Ireland or the Enterprise Ireland structure. Second, when the Government shortly makes a decision regarding the decentralisation of civil servants to the regions County Roscommon, particularly the town of Roscommon, should be earmarked for the transfer of civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The workers in Precision Casting in Roscommon have been picketing since June 2001. They were locked out on 27 June when the company closed down while the workers were on strike. They have been given a statutory redundancy payment of one week for every year's service but have challenged this payment in the Labour Court and have been awarded three weeks redundancy payment. The company has not honoured this award. I ask that the Government, in the current talks on a new national agreement, make the new legislation retrospective to cover the case of these workers, who have been on picket duty for more than a year and a half. This is the minimum that can be offered to these workers. I know there are workers in similar circumstances throughout the country but the people in Precision Casting in Roscommon have been locked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Roscommon is an employment blackspot. It is ten years since we had a positive response regarding jobs and it is time we got our fair share of what is available. I call on the Government and the agencies under its jurisdiction to respond in a positive way to the needs of County Roscommon.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_432">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_760">I thank Deputy Finneran for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The job losses at the companies mentioned by the Deputy have been spread over a period of time. Indeed, in the case of one of the companies in Roscommon, the matter was discussed on the Adjournment in the Seanad on 28 June 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The recently announced job losses in Ballinasloe are still very fresh in our minds – they were discussed on the Adjournment of this House last evening. The Tánaiste has pledged her support for the workers in Ballinasloe. She is determined to use every facility at her disposal to encourage alternative investment to locate in the area. The fact that Ballinasloe has fared badly in recent years has been acknowledged. The considerable new investments that have located elsewhere in the region are little comfort to workers in the town who have lost their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Finding new investment and providing new sources of employment in the areas mentioned will not be easy but the Tánaiste is determined to do everything she can to see that this happens. The State agencies continue to market these areas. They form part of the Border, midland and west region, which is a priority location for jobs promotion by the agencies. The agencies are also committed to bringing about balanced regional development. The availability of suitable premises and committed and motivated workforces are major selling points.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Recognising that urban environments are generally more attractive for mobile investment, IDA Ireland has adopted a target of having 50% of all new greenfield investment located in the Objective One region which includes Roscommon and Longford. IDA Ireland has sought to encourage investment in the defined sectors of medical devices, ICT, engineering and internationally traded services-software to the region, which seeks to build on the relative advantages in various towns. An essential part of this endeavour had been refining IDA Ireland property offerings. This is a key tool to winning investments. IDA Ireland is continuing to design and develop high quality business parks and advance factory units, fully serviced to international standards. In that context, IDA Ireland is currently pursuing the possibility of a new business park in Longford town and advance units in Roscommon town.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Enterprise Ireland has approved support for community enterprise centres in Ballinasloe, Roscommon and Ballaghaderreen and a feasibility study is under way to investigate the potential of developing a centre in Boyle.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">FÁS, in particular, is always available to provide workers with every possible support in circumstances where jobs have been lost. Its services include placement and retraining facilities. The companies that have got into difficulty generally also want to assist in the efforts to find alternative employment for their employees. This is a very welcome example of good corporate social responsibility. In the most recent case in Ballinasloe, the company has indicated its intention to provide a fair severance package that recognises the contribution of workers over a long number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The question of a task force for the area has been raised before. However, the Tánaiste is satisfied that the development agencies under the aegis of her Department are fully committed to the promotion of employment in the area. The agencies also work closely with local development bodies, including the county development boards and other local bodies and interests, to facilitate an integrated approach to the development of the area. A focused agency approach combined with a local based approach is what is needed to address the jobs situation. A task force would only serve to add an additional layer over the combined and committed efforts of the local organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Both the Tánaiste and I share a real concern to ensure that all the resources of our development agencies remain focused on this difficult employment situation and that the people who have lost their jobs are given opportunities for further employment and retraining.</p>

        <heading>Flood Relief.</heading>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_433">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_768">Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising the matter of the recent flooding on the north side of Dublin and of flood preventive measures. The recent floods affected a number of areas of my constituency, particularly Richmond Road, Gracepark Road and Clonturk Park. The people in these areas were devastated by the floods and the massive damage to their homes and premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I raise this issue first to express my support and solidarity for the people of Clonturk Park, Richmond Road and Gracepark Road. I visited these areas a number of times during and after the floods and I am now calling on the Minister urgently to intervene to assist these residents and to ensure – and I mean ensure – that this never happens again. I demand, on behalf of the people of these areas, that the following matters be addressed: the need for Government to declare the localities affected a disaster area and to give them top priority; the need for immediate relief for families affected and compensation, accommodation and security for their unoccupied homes; the need to put in place real and credible flood defences immediately; the issue of insurance claims and Deputy Parlon's commitment that insurance companies re-insure these homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">There must be a complete review of the drainage of the River Tolka regarding, for example, planning and development and infrastructural projects. The MCOS consulting engineers have done a study of the River Tolka. We must have access to the interim report of these consultants. We must also prioritise the completion of the full report. Many of my constituents are asking why we must wait until May 2003 for this report. We need a guarantee that all necessary funding to complete the work will be provided as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">These people must be supported and I urge the Minister of State and the Government to listen to their reasonable and genuine demands. I am not interested in more reports and more studies on the flooding or dredging of the River Tolka or on the cleaning of gulleys. We need urgent action. I accept this is not the sole responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, although he has a major role to play. Dublin City Council must also move on the issue. I have begun this work in City Hall and we have come up with some reasonably good responses to the problem of flooding in the area. It is environmental vandalism to do nothing about this flooding.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">There is also a major health and safety issue involved. This flood has led to the increased emergence of rats in the area. Pest control companies tell us there are nine million rats in the city of Dublin. Over five million are in the northside and many were seen during the recent floods. There is a report that one particular gentleman suffered from Weil's disease as a result of the floods. I would like clarification of this case. There should be a serious investigation by the health authorities into this issue. If we invest and top-up on flood preventative measures we can save lives, homes and finances in the future. It would be good effective planning and money well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Many of us have concerns that this issue is not receiving the priority status it deserves. I call on the Minister of State to respond urgently to the needs of the residents of Clonturk Park, Gracepark Road, Richmond Road and other affected areas along the Tolka. My colleague, Deputy Gregory, with whom I work closely on this issue, is looking after the areas in Dublin Central. I have also had reports and queries on the walls along the Tolka, the dredging and the potential again for the flood waters breaking the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">These concerns must be investigated and we must ensure that the work being carried out is of top quality. This cannot be allowed to happen again. I urge the Minister of State to keep his eye on the ball at all times on this issue. People's homes are at stake. Homes have been destroyed and people cannot be allowed to go through this again. They are tired, angry and upset and have a right to our support. People must be compensated properly and the insurance companies will have to be told of their responsibility to their clients and the community. I will not stand idly by while the people of this area are being pushed around or exploited by these companies. This is why I raise the urgent issue of flooding along the Tolka in the Dáil today.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">People do not want to see a Taoiseach photographed up to his knees in water. They want to see workmen on the banks of the Tolka doing the work and getting on with the job. I urge the Minister of State to ensure these residents are looked after adequately and to bring in top quality flood preventative measures to ensure this never happens again. We have had enough talk and enough reports, now I want action.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_434">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_776">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Following the severe flooding from the River Tolka, which took place on 14 and 15 November 2002, Dublin City Council requested the Office of Public Works to provide assistance in carrying out some emergency works. The Office of Public Works constructed a new wall at the rear of some houses off Tolka Road which were in danger of subsiding as well as removing some trees which were obstructing water flow in the channel.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Dublin City Council requested the consultants carrying out the flooding study on the River Tolka as part of the greater Dublin strategic drainage study to produce an interim report on what measures could be taken in the immediate term to alleviate flooding in the worst affected areas. The interim report made a number of recommendations on flood alleviation measures and Dublin City Council has requested the Office of Public Works to fund some of the measures identified. The Office of Public Works and Dublin City Council have now agreed a package of works to be carried out on the River Tolka in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas of Dublin city. These agreed works will be undertaken by Office of Public Works on behalf of the Dublin City Council. The proposed works are currently the subject of a public consultation procedure by the city council as required by part 8 of the planning and development regulations of which the Deputy is well aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Despite the major concerns of residents, the minute one attempts to interfere with the river people will express their views and we must take those on board. Included in this are the raising or construction of walls and embankments at various locations between Glasnevin and Drumcondra, replacement and raising of Woodville Road footbridge, and also the raising of some ground upstream of Tolka Park. I am advised that Dublin City Council officials hope to put the report on the part 8 public consultation before the March meeting of Dublin City Council for approval. If it is approved, work on these measures will take place immediately thereafter. In the interim, the city council is also consulting with the relevant bodies in relation to any environmental implications of the proposed works. The agreed programme of works will be funded by Office of Public Works and is expected to cost in the region of €600,000 –€700,000. In addition to these works, the Office of Public Works is undertaking further emergency works in the form of the maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir in Drumcondra to Glasnevin, to remove accumulated silt and debris in order to maximise channel capacity in this area and construction of embankments from Woodville Road footbridge upstream along both sides of Griffith Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">There are other recommendations contained in the interim report in addition to the above works. However, it would take quite a considerable time to implement all the recommendations as detailed site investigations and design as well as public consultation would be required. My concern, and that of the city council, has been to agree a package of works that can be implemented quickly at this stage to provide some protection should another flood occur. I am conscious also that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed in May and this will provide additional information on which decisions in relation to the entire river catchment can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I assure the House of my utmost concern for the victims of flooding and the House can rest assured that the Office of Public Works will continue to give advice and assistance to the city council in its efforts to deal with this matter.</p>

        <heading>Services for People with Disabilities.</heading>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_435">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_781">I am delighted and anxious to put briefly before the Minister the dire situation in which St. Michael's House, on the northside of Dublin, and the other organisations which represent people with intellectual disabilities such as NAMHI, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance, the Irish Autism Alliance and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">St. Michael's House will receive no extra funding whatever in 2003 for new residential, respite or day services. Currently eight service users are out of home mainly due to the death of the final care giver – often an elderly parent. St. Michael's House has the largest waiting list for residential care places in Ireland with 344 on the list. Many of these have elderly parents and it is expected that 20 or 30 will be out of a home before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The organisation has rented houses and taken on staff and is receiving no funding whatsoever from the Department of Health and Children. Effectively, what has happened is that the three year programme of residential care provision has collapsed completely and has been destroyed and removed by the Government. I wish to set out a few examples of the problems faced by elderly parents. Constituent A is a 35 year old man with a severe learning disability. He is a wheelchair user. He is a large man weighing 18 stone and needs two people to transfer him with an electronic hoist. He lives with elderly parents who have had health difficulties for some time. Constituent B is a 29 year old man with a severe learning disability. He is a wheelchair user but is extremely active and requires high levels of supervision. He has a poor sleep pattern and his mother may have to get up to him six or seven times a night. He is dependent on her, a 65 year old widow, for all his personal care.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Constituent C is a 17 year old girl with a severe learning disability and autism. She has challenging behaviour and can scream loudly and consistently. She can show some unusual obsessional behaviour. She lives with both parents who are finding life increasing difficult and hard.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Constituent D is a 39 year old man with a moderate learning disability. He lives with his mother who is a 72 year old widow. She has no other family supports to take care of him. I could go on to constituents E, F and G and I can give the Minister documentation from St. Michael's House if he wants it. It is an appalling state of affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I am also very proud to represent organisations such as NAMHI, NPSA, the Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the autism body. We have heard from NAMHI. The Minister and every single Deputy will be aware of the waiting list of 1,711 citizens living at home who are desperately in need of residential service care. A further 861 require a day service and a further 1,014 require a respite service. Still in 2003, despite the campaigns of so many Members, Ministers and journalists such as Vincent Browne, there are over 400 people with intellectual disabilities living in totally unsuitable conditions in long-term psychiatric hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">We did have a three-year programme and a phoney debate after the election. I am glad to see one of the Ministers here who participated in that phoney debate. I referred to this earlier with the Minister for Finance – a country with a surplus of €5.5 billion decided not to continue with our three year programme. We now have a desperate situation which requires a desperate response. A number of the organisations, NAMHI and others, heard the disgraceful comments by the Taoiseach in which he referred to the small dignified protest by the national organisations representing citizens with intellectual disability, as a small crowd made up of four organisations. NAMHI represents 160 organisations around the country and provides services for some 28,000 people. The other three bodies mainly involved – the NPSA, Irish Autism Alliance and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies – were also very responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">As I said to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the debate on a tax matter, the Ministers responsible can change this. In the coming weeks we could have an emergency programme or can simply continue the programme of additional provision for citizens with an intellectual disability. The Ministers responsible are not vindicating their rights, rather they are refusing to provide the necessary resources for them, even though they are in desperate need. The Ministers are a disgrace. I urge them at this late stage, particularly as there is a suplus of €5.5 billion, to provide these basic facilities for citizens with an intellectual disability. If they do not, week after week, my colleagues and I will continue to raise the matter until they do. I urge early action for St. Michael's, the NAMHI, the NPSA and all the other bodies which have during the years heroically tried to take care of our most vulnerable citizens.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_436">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_789">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Over the past two years an additional 90 day places, 83 residential places and 14 residential respite places have been provided by St. Michael's House funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I understand next week the Taoiseach will formally open St. Michael's short-term training centre at Adare Green, Coolock, which has been designed to give young persons the skills and confidence they need going into adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">I am aware, however, of the concerns regarding the provision of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated nationally to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the significant review investment amounting to €188 million made in these services since 1997 when the Deputy last supported a Government in this House and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and about 2,000 new day places for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services, in particular, although the number in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late twenties and early thirties requiring full-time residential services. I am acutely aware of the particular difficulties St. Michael's House is facing in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment as reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health service. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of services across all service programmes, including services for persons with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, the Department of Health and Children will work closely with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in relation to the service provision for this year.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_794">I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asking him which land areas had been examined in regard to the proposed facility for the Prison Service headquarters, a storage facility and juvenile place of detention. I was disappointed with the response in which I was told that, on foot of advertisements, submissions regarding 25 properties had been received and that another 15 sites were in State ownership. I was disappointed I was not given any details on any of these alternative facilities which might have helped. Possibly, some submissions were made in confidence and I can only presume they were made by landowners who were not able to have their land rezoned for residential purposes and possibly thought they could make a few bucks by selling it as prison space.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I know Inchicore was turned down as a site and that Lucan was considered. I wish to point to the unsuitability of the site at Newlands Villa. That is the reason I ask the Minister to strongly consider reviewing the matter. Although an advertisement was placed in the newspapers before Christmas in this regard, it is still not too late to stop it. The response to the parliamentary question I tabled stated no final decision had been taken but given that an advertisement has been placed seeking submissions, etc., the Government must be strongly considering the Clondalkin site.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">There are a number of reasons the site is not suitable. It is located on the Naas Road in the Tallaght electoral area just outside my constituency of Dublin Mid-West. It is, however, in the townland of Clondalkin in which there are already two prison facilities. I have never been an advocate of the "not in my back yard" syndrome but there is a certain siege mentality in Clondalkin which is considered to be a disadvantaged area, no less than Tallaght. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is keeping an eye on proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">That is a minor point but the main point is that the proposed site is located in a green belt area which has for years been fought for by the communities in Kingswood, Tallaght and Clondalkin. It is a precious piece of land because some of the other land in the area is owned by the IRFU. There is a belief that if the facility goes ahead and a significant chunk of the green belt is eaten into, the rest of it will be diminished and there will be no green belt along the Belgard Road and the Naas dual carriageway between Clondalkin and Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I suggest the Minister uses an existing brown field site or facility such as the one in Shanganagh which, given its type, would have to be significantly altered. I have received submissions from various members of the Prison Service on the q.t. in that regard. Whatever his thoughts on the matter, will the Minister look again at its location? There are other facilities on greenfield sites which would not act as a border between areas and have potential. There is a reliable public transport service, even as far out as Maynooth, and land banks available, possibly at agricultural land prices, which would be more suitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I highlight the significant danger to the public arising from the proposed location which borders the Naas dual carriageway, off which access would be gained. A key point is that South Dublin County Council planners have made a submission objecting in the strongest terms to the proposed location. The zoning of the land allows for prison utilities, a Travellers' halting site, certain types of golf developments or spaced out agriculture type housing. The planners take a realistic view in regard to zoning for amenity purposes but, using their expert analysis, have decided the proposed development is not in the interests of proper planning and development of the Clondalkin-Tallaght area. I hope their submission will be taken on board by the Commissioners of Public Works. If not, I hope the Minister will take it on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">I do not know whether the Tánaiste and Deputy Curran from the Dublin Mid-West constituency have made representations to the Minister but as an Opposition Deputy, my hands are not as tied. Will the Minister take into consideration the fact that South Dublin County Council has stated it is a dangerous location? The National Roads Authority generally would not allow road access. I, therefore, question the reason it is allowing it in this case. I urge the Minister to review this location. While we need prison facilities, this is the wrong location.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter. I stress that the fact the advertisement to which he referred was published is by no means evidence that any decision has been made. I know he understands this to be so. Likewise, I understand completely what he said about the opposition of local residents in his constituency and the constituency of Dublin South West. I am also conscious that the local authority has expressed in the strongest terms an objection to the plan on a number of grounds. In those circumstances, I must obviously consider whether this proposal, which is not one that comes from me but which has been put to me, should be proceeded with.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I am examining a number of options, including some of the options mentioned by the Deputy, but not the particular options of Inchicore and Lucan to which he referred. The Deputy will appreciate that the development was supposed to consist of three elements: a store, a prison service headquarters and a juvenile detention centre. One possibility is that, in the context of the Government's programme for decentralisation, the head office of the prison service might be moved out of Dublin. That is an option which I want to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I also wish to consider whether it is necessary to build a juvenile detention centre of this type at all. The Deputy may or may not know that in recent times the special school facilities that were to be provided for younger offenders in St. Patrick's Institution have been the subject of a review by the Government. Whether or not they will be devoted to 14 and 15 year old offenders and unruly children is now the subject matter of a review. It may well be that these will become available to augment St. Patrick's Institution. I must also consider whether, or when, a new institution for 16 and 17 year old offenders is required and whether it should be built in Dublin or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I have not yet reached a firm conclusion as regards the decision I will have to make on this proposal. It is a matter upon which I will require more time to examine all the options open to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_812">I have already advised the House in response to earlier Priority Questions that in the context of the finalisation of the joint bid to UEFA by Scotland and Ireland the Government agreed that, in the event that the bid was successful, it would seek the approval of the Oireachtas to provide financial support to help either upgrade capacity at Lansdowne Road or provide equivalent capacity at an alternative venue to be provided by the IRFU which would not alone comply with the international rugby requirements of the IRFU but also meet with the standards of UEFA for hosting major events.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">This commitment was made in the context of the need for a second stadium to be available in Dublin to host some of the matches of the championships. As the bid was unsuccessful, that commitment no longer arises. Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that the requirement of the IRFU and the FAI for a modern stadium for their prestige international fixtures is central to my consideration of issues around the development of a new stadium.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_816">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 27 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The Irish Open is one of the major sporting events in Ireland. Its importance in tourism marketing can be gauged by the fact that it has a TV audience of about 200 million across 90 countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The international sports tourism initiative, administered by Bord Fáilte, is a successful strategy which involves exploiting the marketing opportunities presented by a number of major international sports events held in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Under that Initiative, Bord Fáilte has, in recent years, invested in the considerable marketing opportunities provided by the Irish Open. Bord Fáilte pays for a package of promotional benefits to highlight Ireland and its tourism merits.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Following the termination of the relationship with its lead sponsor last year, the future of the Irish Open had been in some doubt but the European PGA Tour, with the encouragement of Bord Fáilte, managed to secure a lead sponsor and put together a financial package to preserve the event based partly on an indication from Bord Fáilte of its willingness to continue its marketing investment around the event. I should remind the House that it is the European Tour and not the Golfing Union of Ireland which is the key player in relation to this issue. The tour actually owns the event.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The tour decided to hold the 2003 Irish Open on the well known links course owned by Portmarnock Golf Club. The decision on the location was not made by myself, my Department or any agency under my aegis. In fairness to the club, it must be said that, without the last minute offer of its course, there could well have been no Irish Open this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I met representatives of Portmarnock Golf Club shortly before Christmas. I expressed my own personal preference that they would lift the rule on not allowing women to be members of their club. The representatives assured me they would not fail to apprise the members of my views. They are, however, firmly of the view that the club is a legitimate single-sex club and that its members have a clear right to exercise their constitutional freedom to associate. They also maintain that all non-members are treated in the same way in relation to access to the course.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I hardly need remind the House that freedom of association is one of the key rights in any free society. That freedom is recognised by the Constitution and in the Equal Status Act. The focus of the Act is on the supply of goods and services and not on the nature of an association.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">To be fair to the club, it is true that there has been no legal ruling on the issue as to whether or not it is a "discriminating club" under the Equal Status Act although I understand that the Equality Authority is addressing the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Ultimately, Ceann Comhairle, it is for the courts and not this House to make the judgment on these matters.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_65">There is a very clear legal framework for dealing with equality issues. I put that framework in place under my previous portfolio. I believe that the advent of that framework has been a contributing factor to the current position where, I am informed, only two of the clubs affiliated to the Golfing Union of Ireland, are now male-only clubs.</summary>

          <p eId="para_827">As indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 20 November 2002 under the local authority swimming pool programme 2000-02, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The preliminary report for Youghal swimming pool was approved in July 2001. Contract documents in respect of this project were received from Youghal Town Council in late October 2002 and were sent to Office of Public Works for assessment. The project will be considered further by my Department on completion of this assessment.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_445">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_840">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 17, 18 and 61 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Last December, I launched Tourism Ireland's and Bord Fáilte's joint marketing plans for 2003. These plans set out a comprehensive and vigorous programme of activities designed to attract over 7.5 million visitors to the island of Ireland this year. This is a very ambitious target. If achieved, it would represent a 5% increase on the estimated visitor outturn for 2002 and mark a return to the record tourist numbers of 2000. These targets are predicated on various assumptions particularly in relation to the US where the restoration of key access routes and a peaceful resolution of the Iraqi situation are paramount to achieving growth in this market.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">To financially underpin these marketing programmes, I am happy to point out that, in a period of restraint in our public finances, I have managed to secure an additional €5 million for tourism marketing in my Department's Estimates provision for 2003. This brings the overall Exchequer investment in frontline marketing activities to €48 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">As the Deputies will be aware, Tourism Ireland is a North-South body charged with the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a top class tourism destination. Tourism Ireland has devised a highly focused set of marketing campaigns in the markets which represent the best tourism prospects in 2003. The key markets this year will be Great Britain, USA, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Australia and Canada.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Bord Fáilte has also developed a set of special marketing initiatives for 2003 which will focus on promoting specific tourism products, sports tourism, festivals and cultural events and domestic tourism business. Both bodies have worked together in the development of their marketing programmes to ensure a cohesive and seamless strategy to attract quality tourism business to Ireland this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Thankfully, the doom and gloom scenarios, which were widely predicted over the course of last year, have not materialised. While we may not achieve the record heights of the year 2000, the best available forecasts for 2002 show a moderate recovery – possibly up to 2% – in visitor numbers. In a difficult market, this is very encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">It must also be said that not everyone is gaining and different sectors of the industry are doing better than others. In many ways, the tourism industry is at a crossroads – after almost a decade of continuous growth – the proverbial bubble almost burst in 2001. By its very nature, the sector will always be vulnerable to external shocks – unrest in the Middle East will feature highly among the potential threats in 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_67">A key lesson from the experience of 2001 and last year is that the industry needs to take firm command of those factors over which it has control. It must continue to strive for excellence in the product it offers and deliver on the promise generated by the marketing campaigns. As Tourism Ireland points out, one of the major concerns for 2003 is the potential negative word of mouth generated by the pricing issue. The key challenge for the sector, and the most effective countermeasure, is to ensure that consumers continue to obtain the best possible value for their money.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">In this context, and also in view of recent and imminent structural changes in the way the State works with the sector, I have initiated a major review of tourism policy with a view to identifying the key elements of both an industry and Government-led strategy for the future sustainable development of tourism in Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">Another policy initiative which will have a positive impact on the tourism industry is the establishment of the new National Tourism Development Authority, to be known as Fáilte Ireland. The legislation giving effect to the new authority has been passed by the Seanad and will go before the Dáil shortly. I am confident that the Bill will be enacted at an early date. This new authority will be ideally positioned to help the industry to address the new set of challenges facing tourism as we go into the 21st century, including issues such as value for money, competitiveness and quality which were subject to so much public debate last year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">The year 2003 will undoubtedly present even more challenges for the tourism sector – both from external factors such as the threat of war in Iraq to internal factors such as pressures on the price competitiveness of our tourism product. However, the various programmes and initiatives which I have outlined should help to ensure that Ireland is visible, in the right place, with the right product and the right message to take full advantage of whatever opportunities lie ahead in 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_856">At my request, the Government has approved a proposal to invite expressions of interest by way of public invitation from the private sector in participating, on the basis of a public-private partnership, PPP, in the capital redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre in and-or around the vicinity of the site of the existing theatre.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_74">An expert group comprising representatives of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Office of Public Works, and the National Theatre in its report to my predecessor concluded that the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre on the existing site and existing footprint does not have the potential to address satisfactorily the current problems of the theatre and that in order to be compatible with the functions, profile, and status of a national theatre and to address the acknowledged defects with the existing theatre any redevelopment requires: a signature development, representative of a national theatre in the 21st century; an appropriate civic setting and form part of the overall urban regeneration represented by the O'Connell Street integrated area plan and north-east inner city plan; and these requirements mean that for the theatre to stay in its existing location, it will be necessary to acquire properties adjacent to the existing premises. Two design options have been identified which will provide the required accommodation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">Expressions of interest from the private sector will now be invited, on the basis that: the redevelopment must meet the specified accommodation requirements of the theatre, in terms of size and configuration; the redevelopment must embrace the Abbey and Peacock Theatres and satisfactorily address the current problems of the two theatres; and the facilities available to the national theatre must at all times be consistent with the operational needs of the theatre, and with the requirement to provide a top-quality experience to audiences.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">However, subject to the above, the design may include the provision of additional elements, facilities or functions; and it will fall to the relevant private sector developer to assess the feasibility and financial implications of the property acquisition required, planning issues likely to arise etc., and to factor these risks into the final proposal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">I am pleased that it will now be possible to move forward to the next stage of this development and I look forward to the creation in due course of a new home for the national theatre that reflects its important place in the cultural life of the nation and as the cradle of dramatic genius.</summary>

          <p eId="para_865">Domestic tourism continues to contribute significantly to overall tourism revenue in Ireland. In more difficult times for the tourism sector, the domestic market has proven to be highly important in sustaining the industry and in ensuring a good regional spread of tourism revenue. In 2001, it is estimated that revenue earnings from domestic tourism amounted to €1.26 billion, representing almost a quarter of all tourism revenue for that year. While figures are not yet available for 2002, there are good indications that this segment of the market has stood up well and is set to sustain a positive growth pattern into 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Bord Fáilte is responsible for the domestic marketing programme. In 2003, a budget allocation of €2.5 million has been ear-marked for this purpose. The objectives of the campaign are to increase the number of off-peak holidays and short breaks, to promote regional spread and to provide effective marketing platforms for industry and the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The main activities encompass an extensive advertising campaign under the banner "Make a Break for It", a complementary publicity and PR campaign to highlight the range of holiday opportunities available in Ireland, various promotions and shows such as Holiday World, the Ideal Homes Exhibition and the 3rd Age Show, as well as direct and e-marketing initiatives designed to hone in on the best prospects in the domestic marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The Discover Ireland brochure, which I launched last week, is the linchpin of the domestic marketing campaign.

This plan envisages a phased process over three years based on defined and verifiable obligations on both Israelis and Palestinians. The road map will require measures to be taken simultaneously in the political, security, economic and institutional fields.

The national museum has a number of sites that are used for its storage requirements and has an ongoing programme of rationalising and improving its storage facilities towards ensuring the best care and security of its collections.

As a collecting agency, the museum will always possess significantly more artefacts than are displayed. The museum displays the national collections at facilities at Collins Barracks, Kildare Street, and Merrion Square in Dublin, and Turlough Park House, in County Mayo. The National Museum has an ongoing practice of facilitating loans to venues that meet the necessarily stringent requirements of security, safety and public access. To date a number of such loans have been made to designated county museums. I have no statutory responsibility for county museums.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">When I met representatives of the circus late last year, they made me aware of their financial difficulties. On that occasion, I was able to indicate my intention to modify the definition of "the arts" included in the Arts Bill currently before the Oireachtas to specifically include a reference to "circus." However, State funding for the arts, including circus, is in the main channelled through the Arts Council, which is independent of Government regarding the disbursement of its funds. I have no discretionary funds at my disposal.</p>

A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme, GMS, and the drug payment scheme, DPS. This list ensures equity between the GMS and DPS in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis, as new products become available and deletions are notified.</p>

These include authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. As minerals, vitamins and supplements are generally available without a medical prescription and are advertised to the public, they do not qualify for inclusion in the common list.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1010">I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 70 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1019">The 2000 report from the national intellectual disability database was published in August 2001. The 2001 report will be published before the end of March and the 2002 report will be available by early summer. The annual report is compiled from the regional datasets provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Due to a delay in the submission of one regional dataset, it was not possible to compile the information which forms the basis for the annual report. This was the case in relation to both 2001 and 2002. As already stated above, the 2001 report is currently being finalised and will be published before the end of March.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">In April 2000, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,711 new residential and 912 new day places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. It should be noted that in addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in the services as mentioned above, the additional funding also provided for those requiring a change in day services. These include young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to other areas of the services such as sheltered work, activation or services for older people.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The initial indications from the 2001 data are that while the impact of the 2000 development programme is reflected in the data, there are still a significant number of persons seeking residential services in particular. Demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services even though the numbers of people receiving full-time residential services continue to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">A review of the waiting lists between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Health Research Board and published in the 1999 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, showed that while 269 people from the original waiting list of 1,439 received full time residential services in the period, the waiting list had grown by an additional 238 places, i.e. 507 had joined the waiting list in the period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">The health boards have been informed in their 2003 letters of determination that, given the key role which the national intellectual disability database has in the planning and monitoring of service provision, it is vital that the timetable for the compilation and submission of data in respect of 2003 is complied with. They have also been informed that there will be no extension of this timeframe in relation to the export of data to the Department and that they should take whatever measures are required to ensure that this deadline is met.</summary>

However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on "Current and Future Supply and Demand in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists" from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of occupational therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_109">On 29 May 2002, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year. Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_110">In addition to the Bacon report, I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including occupational therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</summary>

Section 5 of the Act makes it an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell or show child pornography. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,904 or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or both or on conviction on indictment to an unlimited fine or to imprisonment for up to 14 years or both. In addition, a person who having the custody, charge or care of a child, allows that child to be used for the production of child pornography commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €31,743 or to imprisonment for up to 14 years or both.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1079">The student summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. Since 1997 the take up has been dropping gradually, coinciding undoubtedly with the upsurge in the economy and the wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Given the financial pressures on my Department and in order to focus resources available in the best possible way, it was decided to discontinue the student summer jobs scheme.</p>
