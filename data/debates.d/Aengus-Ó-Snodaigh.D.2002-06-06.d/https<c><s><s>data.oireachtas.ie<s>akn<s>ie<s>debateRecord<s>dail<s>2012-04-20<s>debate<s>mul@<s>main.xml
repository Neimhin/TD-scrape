          <p eId="para_7">The record will show that I was in attendance.  To clarify for Members opposite, it is proposed that the debate on Second Stage of this very important Bill which could cause a loss of Irish sovereignty and tie us to austerity indefinitely should be guillotined at 12.30 p.m. and that the time allocated for Committee and Remaining Stages should be limited to one hour.  Even though it is very difficult in any referendum Bill to alter the wording on Committee Stage, the guillotine should not applied in this instance.  I acknowledge that we are sitting on a Friday, which is a welcome change.  However, on this occasion we should sit for as long as is necessary today, tomorrow and Sunday, as long as there are speakers who wish to contribute to the debate.  Therefore, I urge the Government not to proceed with the guillotine.  I have opposed guillotines on a range of issues but this is one of the most important debates to have taken place in respect of the future of Ireland.</p>

It is good there is an Order of Business and that legislation is before Members today.  Can the Minister assure Members that future Friday sittings to deal with Private Members' business, which is important and has been a positive initiative in this House, will expand to do precisely what is being done today?  Will such sittings have an Order of Business, will Ministers answer questions and will legislation be brought before Members?</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_172">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which will play a crucial role in the future of the country.  Since the EU leaders finalised the agreement of the fiscal compact in late January, Fianna Fáil has consistently argued that the people of Ireland should be consulted on the issue via a referendum.  We will campaign in favour of the treaty on 31 May as a significant step in facing up to the fundamental challenges facing the eurozone.  Yesterday I had the privilege of being appointed Fianna Fáil director of elections for the upcoming campaign and I look forward to a vigorous few weeks on the trail engaging with voters.  However, this is only a step on the long road and other critical measures must be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The role of the ECB should be fundamentally reformed and expanded, fiscal union must be established and pan-European banking regulations should be fully set out.  The fundamental design flaws of the euro must be addressed in order to get Europe's economy moving again.  Public discourse on this treaty must be fully informed and the wider issues of what must be ultimately done to stave off the euro crisis and to place economic growth on a sustainable path should be kept at the forefront of public debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Fianna Fáil has a long and proud history as a pro-European party.  We take pride in having led Ireland into the European Economic Community, EEC, in 1973, and that historic moment broke the reliance of this country on the UK, marking a defining decision and our place in world history.  The role of Europe in the economic and social advancement of this country has been richly beneficial for all sections of Irish life with the ongoing role of the EU in supporting the Northern Irish peace process and our agricultural industry, providing open markets for our exporters and infrastructural development, as well as facilitating ease of travel for citizens across the Continent and the free flow of capital.  All these aspects of our involvement with the EU have shaped how we live across the island and the quality of life we enjoy, which would have been unimaginable in previous generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">From the European Coal and Steel Community to the Treaty of Rome to the current fiscal compact treaty, the European project has transformed the Continent, a landscape which was devastated by war, populated by people ravaged by poverty and ruled by nations locked into continuous conflict.  It has changed utterly to one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners of the world in human history.  The acrimony of the feuding which bloodied the pages of European history has been supplemented by an era of co-operation, economic growth and rising living standards.  The European Union represents a project of transnational co-operation on a historically unprecedented scale.  The Single European Act 1986 guaranteed freedom of capital movement, goods and services and altered national boundaries on a scale that no other inter-state organisation has attempted.  The rich benefits of markets and borders open for business, study, holidays or living abroad can be taken for granted but other generations could only have imagined them.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The aspersions cast upon the EU as an elitist project ignores the major role it has played in advancing the cause of democracy across a Continent torn apart by fascism and communism.  Membership of the EU has provided a strong incentive for the democratisation of and deepening respect for human rights among applicant states.  The success of the EU played a major role in staving off the threat of communism and the advancement of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  It stands as a shining example to other tentative unions, such as the African Union and the Arab League, and their efforts to create mutually beneficial and peaceful links between precariously related states.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The euro crisis, unacceptably high unemployment levels, stagnant economic growth and the grave challenges for sovereign debt mark a serious challenge to the European project which has secured so much for this Continent.  Fundamental design flaws in the euro from its origins in the post-Berlin Wall Maastricht treaty have returned to haunt the currency.  The idea of a single currency was borne from a long-standing effort to combat the currency battles that scarred the EEC and the resulting price instability that undermined economic growth.  Under a single currency, events like the "Battle of the Franc" in the early 1990s would become a relic.  In the grave uncertainty and instability of the post-world war globe, with a reunited Germany at the centre of Europe, there were also clear political implications in utilising a single currency to bind the Continent closer.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">From its inception there was a failure to appreciate fully the ties between monetary and fiscal union.  The illusion of lowered sovereign debt among diverging states, the need for banking regulation because of free-flowing currency across member states and the deepening of economic links between participating countries has undermined the currency.  Fiscal imbalance between states due to an inability to adjust currencies was initially obscured in the buoyant early years of the euro.  However, the financial crisis that exploded from the sub-prime mortgages problem of 2007 has mercilessly exposed these flaws.  Bond markets have reacted sharply against the failure to confront these problems.  The previously converging bond yields on German sovereign debt and those of peripheral states, like Greece, were sharply torn asunder.  Market confidence in the reliability of sovereign debt as an investment was firmly shook, with the repercussions felt across all countries when agency ratings such as the French AAA standard were downgraded and bond yields in Spain and Italy soared dangerously high.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The pressing demands of the crisis have abated somewhat as the deal on Greek debt with creditors ramped up long-term ECB financing of banks and escalated secondary market bond buying, assuaging immediate problems.  The long-term challenges persist and it would be extremely naïve of any commentator to assume the current relative calm indicates the problems have passed.  If action is not taken to tackle these problems, even greater challenges will emerge in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The capacity of member states to borrow is reliant on taking significant and meaningful measures to tackle these problems, and this treaty is a step towards addressing them.  The future of the eurozone hinges on putting in place a renewed infrastructure to solve the problems that have beset the currency.  Economic growth in the EU is also bound with the fate of the single currency, as the collapse of the euro is estimated to have the potential to inflict between 25% and 50% in loss to GDP, according to certain studies.  The capacity to borrow at affordable rates is a crucial tool in the economic kit of states which must borrow to fund infrastructural developments and meet ongoing financial obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">In essence, this fiscal compact treaty is a beefed up version of the 1996 growth and stability pact, which laid out a framework for the budgetary discipline of member states.  However, the Stability and Growth Pact lacked effective enforcement rules.  It is well known that Germany and France were the first two countries to break the provisions of that pact, breaching the deficit rules for several consecutive years.  However, this compact aims to enforce these rules by imposing stringent oversight and a clear active role for the European Court of Justice.  The fiscal compact treaty attempts to reduce the chance for poorer fiscal policy in one country to affect another country through budgetary oversight and co-ordination, as well as multi-year budgeting.  This aims to enshrine good fiscal policy by making imprudent fiscal policies harder to enact in member states.  We will argue throughout the campaign that the treaty is not enough on its own to solve the eurozone crisis.  It is, however, one critical part of the puzzle and a step towards a comprehensive set of policies and the overhaul of the eurozone design framework needed to address the fundamental problems the eurozone faces.  The limited mandate of the European Central Bank is one such fundamental issue that needs to be addressed.  The lack of uniform financial regulation, including a pan-European eurozone bank resolution regime, is also a fundamental requirement, one which will have to be addressed in addition to the provisions and measures set out in the fiscal compact.  The lack of a more ambitious fiscal union, one which involves transfers between states, is a key issue which will have to be addressed as part of an overall resolution of the crisis that has engulfed the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Dr. Alan Ahearne correctly describes the treaty as an indispensable bridge to the policies necessary to confront the crisis, which creates a framework to co-ordinate fiscal policy in countries sharing the euro currency and allows for macroeconomic policy efforts across the eurozone.  The treaty is best viewed as an essential part of the foundations of a new fiscal and monetary structure for the eurozone.  It can also be viewed as putting in place the fiscal constraints needed before financial transfers to countries with weaker economies can occur to compensate for the financial imbalances that result from monetary union.  This combination of fiscal and monetary measures is required to tackle the crisis by addressing the basic design flaws of the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Fiscal union is the only real solution to the crisis and the problem of generating the economic growth and job creation required to tackle the endemic unemployment and anaemic growth levels that have hit Ireland hard in recent years.  Without an effective system of financial transfers such as pooled sovereign debt, the economic dominance of Germany and other northern European countries will be copper-fastened because countries with weaker economies are unable to devalue their currency to compete.  Fiscal union with eurobonds that pool sovereign debt will strengthen all member states' economic performance.  The US Federal Reserve provides a model from which the European Central Bank can draw in expanding monetary policy to buy debt from member states.  The current restrictive system under which it is empowered only to purchase debt from the secondary market limits the financial firepower available to the bank - sometimes referred to as the bazooka effect - in tackling financial events.  The ramped up capacity to buy sovereign debt providing a backstop to national debt would act as a panacea to market doubts about the viability of sovereign debt in the euro area.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">This expansion of the role of the European Central bank can only take place if national budgetary constraints are in place to avoid the significant threats of inflation and currency devaluation.  Strong, unified financial regulation across the European Union reflecting the reality of international finance within the remit of the ECB will be vital in ensuring the banking crisis we have endured is not repeated in the future.  This is particularly salient in the case of Ireland which met the Stability and Growth Pact requirements with ease but laboured under the illusion created by a bank fuelled property bubble.  Pan-European regulation would ensure the spectacle of German banks recklessly lending to Irish banks and fuelling a property bubble would be avoided in the future.  We have seen the effect of global finance in the ghost estates that ring our towns and in homeowners struggling with negative equity.  Let us ensure we learn lessons and, more importantly, apply them.  We will make this argument on the campaign trail.  While the treaty is a significant step in the right direction, a long journey lies ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The Fianna Fáil Party has continuously taken the initiative and spearheaded European Union engagement.  Continued engagement with our European partners hinges on the legitimacy that can only be bestowed by the popular decision of citizens.  For this reason, my party has continuously called for a referendum to be held on the substantive issue of the treaty to secure democratic approval for what is a fundamental measure.  The ongoing support of ordinary citizens for the European project is vital to its future and losing this connection would ultimately destroy the European Union.  Governments should not fear putting critical decisions to the people.  The Government tried desperately to avoid holding a referendum.  For all its talk of rebuilding relations with our European partners, its eagerness to avoid a referendum immediately puts it on the back foot in the referendum campaign.  We know a little about its reluctance in this regard because Germany's Minister with responsibility for European affairs, Mr. Michael Link, stated the European Union negotiations sought to design the eurozone fiscal compact in such a way as to avoid a referendum in Ireland.  According to him, the negotiators sought "to design everything that is on the table in a way which would be okay in the eyes of the Attorney General and the Irish Constitution so that no referendum is needed."  This was one of the worst decisions made by the Government in the entire process because it indicated that it was not prepared to engage in a transparent process.  As a fundamentally important agreement, the Government should have engaged with the people on the treaty at a much earlier stage.  Its strident attempts to avoid a referendum and statements by certain Cabinet Ministers that referendums were by their nature not especially democratic have had a corrosive impact on the democratic legitimacy of the treaty and our ongoing engagement with the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">On a broader level, efforts must be made to address the democratic deficit that is steadily eroding the core of the European project.  A full, open and honest debate on the future direction of the European Union should always be at the heart of major EU decisions.  The referendum marks a crossroads for Ireland's involvement with the Union.  People will make a positive choice by voting in favour of the treaty and the step forward it represents for the country and, more importantly, the European project as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The rush to hold the referendum after the Attorney General's legal advice was issued does not bode well for the campaign.  I am also wary of the Government using the referendum to score cheap political points.  I watched the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in the House yesterday.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_191">If the Minister will allow me to conclude, I will explain my position.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, started it yesterday with remarks she made on the "Morning Ireland" programme which were followed by the statement made by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the House.  Such contributions infuriate Fianna Fáil Party members who are working to ensure we get our supporters out to vote in favour of the treaty.  It would be helpful if those Ministers who tend to put their feet in their mouths when speaking on various issues were to say little about the treaty in the next six weeks.  Blatantly placing the referendum in the fray of domestic politics by explicitly linking it with the Government's economic recovery plans risks turning the debate into a partisan affair.  I know the Minister will not engage negatively as he has a great track record of embracing and understanding Deputies on this side.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The Government's claim at a launch yesterday that a website on the referendum was new when it had operated previously smacked of laziness.  I only hope its information campaign marks a major leap forward from the debacles of the household charge and water metering and that lessons have been learned for the forthcoming referendum.  The Government must run an earnest, energetic and positive campaign based on the merits of the treaty and the strength and role of the European Union.  Citizens must be fully informed on the subject and the temptation to enter the mire of misinformation in which some opponents of the treaty have engaged must be avoided.  The strengths of the Union speak for themselves and the crude propaganda that lowers the quality of the debate on this vital issue should not be indulged in by either side.  In the past some of those on the "Yes" side showed a tendency to over-egg the benefits to the State of certain treaties.  On this occasion, the text of the treaty is relatively straightforward and largely devoid of the type of Eurospeak with which we are familiar.  We should argue our case based on the content of the treaty and its implications for the country, rather than engaging in the extraneous arguments that featured strongly in previous campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Current opinion polls which indicate that 30% of the electorate will vote in favour of the treaty as opposed to 23% who will vote against it should not lull those of us who argue in favour of it into a false sense of security.  With 40% of voters undecided, the campaign remains wide open and shows clear potential for a swing to the "No" side.  Reflecting on potential pitfalls in the campaign, I am reminded of some of the words spoken after a previous referendum:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_194">We were left with the vacuum in which misinformation began to seep into people's minds and negative attitudes about a range of issues emerged during the course of the campaign.  Confusion about the treaty was a contributory factor.  Complacency is always the other enemy, in that if people see all the political parties lined up in favour of a positive answer to referendum questions, some of them will inevitably conclude that the referendum will pass while forgetting that it cannot pass unless people vote for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">These were the words of the Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, to Dáil Éireann after the defeat of the first Lisbon treaty referendum.  I trust that he will heed the concerns he expressed during that referendum campaign and have every faith that he will.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I look forward to performing my role as director of elections for Fianna Fáil.  We intend to run a strong campaign, based on a positive message of engagement with the European Union.  We will outline our vision for the steps needed to address the euro crisis.  We welcome the treaty as the first significant move in the right direction.  Our canvassers and leaflets will highlight the positive contribution the European Union has made to Irish life and the immense potential that the future holds.  We will not shy away from the scale of the current challenges the Union faces but will support the treaty as a positive first significant step.  We will assiduously avoid running a negative campaign solely based on fear and crude misinformation, which was such a feature of previous campaigns.  The citizens of Ireland deserve better than this.  Therefore, I call on all parties to ensure we will have the quality of debate needed at such an important moment for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Fianna Fáil, unashamedly, believes in the European project.  Leading Ireland into the European Union and reaping the benefits of EU engagement are an enduring legacy that has transformed the country for the better.  The treaty is another step in our relationship with the European Union from which the people have benefited so much in the past 30 years.  The decision facing the people on 31 May is whether Ireland should stay at the heart of the European Union that has pressed forward fundamental social and economic advances on the island.  Fianna Fáil will fight to secure that place and looks forward to bringing that case to citizens.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_198">I would like to share time with Deputies Heydon, Griffin, Conlon and Humphries.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Ireland may be an island but our trade, currency, exports and workforce stretch far beyond our geographical boundaries.  This is a small open economy.  This is easily said, but to underline and understand this fact, we need to recognise that Ireland exports 80% of everything it produces.  We also depend on the stability of the currency - the euro - which we share in a 17 country eurozone.  However, our reputation as a trading and exporting country, as a business focused country and a good place in which to work and raise a family has been severely damaged in recent years.  Today, we are dependent on international institutions to pay pensions and wages and to keep our hospitals, schools and other public services running.  Ireland and the European Union need stability which is at the core of the new treaty which strengthens the rules that support the euro and introduces better national budget rules, with improvements in the way euro countries work together and support each other.  This is vital for all of the European Union but especially for Ireland.  A stable euro will build confidence, helping to recover and generate jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The treaty gives Ireland an insurance policy, ensuring we will have access to money to fund public services and government spending, if we need it. The Government is determined to return to the financial markets next year to raise money on our own again, like we did before.  We are on target to do this, but we must also recognise that we cannot control world events and the world economy.  The markets need to know that there is a backup in the form of the European Stability Mechanism, which we can only access if we ratify the treaty on 31 May.  There are major benefits for Ireland, but, of course, it is also in our interests that all European countries have access to the ESM, if they need it. and manage their budgets in a responsible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">A supportive vote for the treaty on 31 May will not change Ireland overnight.  It will not immediately eliminate the array of challenges the Government is working to resolve.  However, support for the treaty will be an important part of the solution and a step forward for Ireland, the European Union and the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I was in the United States and the United Kingdom in the past few months.  I have also been in contact with people from all over the globe and the perception of Ireland is very positive.  This is reflected in the amount of investment that has happened in recent weeks and the number of jobs created by foreign direct investment.  The reason this is happening is confidence in the country is definitely improving among international investors, which is reflected in investment and the creation of jobs here.  I am sure the people who will benefit from the 500 extra jobs in Apple are delighted this morning.  This is not just a coincidence.  Apple would not be making such a big investment were it not for the fact that it has confidence in the economy and how the Government is handling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">At one time we were the shining light of Europe; then we were among those who nearly dragged it down.  Now we are doing the right things and if we approve the treaty, it will send a very important signal from Ireland and Europe.  The eyes of the world will certainly be on us.  The European Union will go on without us, but internationally many will be looking to see how we handle the treaty.  For that reason, the referendum is so important.  I hope reason will prevail and that the recent introduction by the Government of charges, property taxes and so on will not cloud the debate and that people will look at the treaty separately from local political issues and vote for their futures.  For those who are in receipt of various benefits, they should vote to protect them.  Without this mechanism available to us in the future, it could have serious implications for all those who depend on the taxpayer to provide them with job supports or welfare benefits.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon</from>
          <p eId="para_204">The decision in the referendum on the European stability treaty is one of the most important the country will take in the coming years.  We will decide if we want to remain at the heart of the eurozone or leave ourselves outside the new rules and regulations for eurozone countries.  There will be no second chance for us to review the treaty decision.  Once 12 of the 17 eurozone countries ratify the treaty, it will be passed and apply to these countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Our entire economic recovery and future sustainability are linked with the ongoing stability and strength of the Europeand Union and the eurozone.  We agreed to become a member of the common European currency in June 1992, following the signing of the Maastricht treaty.  In taking that decision we signed up to a common set of principles that must apply to countries using the same currency.  What we are seeing in the referendum is the transposition of these same rules into Irish law.  That many of the rules on balanced budgets and deficits were not enshrined in legislation has brought us and the eurozone towards the frightening vista of the collapse of an economy and our currency.  It is in our interests that other countries should also sign up to these rules and keep stricter controls, particularly when we see what has happened in countries such as Greece.  We also need these controls for future Governments to ensure we keep a tighter rein on spending.  The fiscal compact copperfastens many of the rules and regulations to which we have signed up to as a member of the eurozone.  These rules are required to ensure the public finances will never again be left in a state where we have to be bailed out by our European neighbours.  The former Taoiseach Mr. John Bruton has stated there should be much tighter rules which would prevent the presentation of generous budgets in the run-up to elections.  If we look back at the budgets in the lead-up to the 2002 and 2007 general elections, they had a lasting and damaging impact on the economy for short-term political gain.  The rules mentioned will go some way towards preventing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">It is also in our interests that the confidence that is beginning to show in the economy and has led to an increasing number of job announcements continues to grow.  The many recent job announcements such as PayPal, Eli Lilly, Mylan yesterday and Apple today, while a result of our re-emerging stability, are also a factor of our eurozone membership.  Would these jobs be coming here if, after the referendum, we were viewed as not being at the heart of Europe?  We have a unique selling point as the only English speaking country in the eurozone, and at a time when we need all the advantages we can get, this is something we should be promoting and emphasising.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">As a Deputy from a rural background and a farmer, I believe that the ratification of this treaty is vital to the continued strong performance of our agricultural sectors.  This has already been recognised by the main farming groups such as the IFA, ICMSA and Macra na Feirme, which have already announced their support for a "Yes" vote and the active campaigning of their substantial membership to vote "Yes".  That is a ringing endorsement of the treaty and we need to see the further activation of civic society on this.  It is not only a case of politicians needing to sell this treaty, we also need everybody who has an interest in the future of this country to agree not only to vote "Yes" but to sell that message to their colleagues, friends and further afield.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Ratification of this treaty will allow successful sectors such as the agrifood sector in which there is production and exports to continue to grow and expand for the benefit of the entire Irish economy.  At a time when Irish food is on the up, for any company that is exporting, our position in Europe and as a major trading bloc is crucial to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Agriculture is one of the few sectors in which there is a common policy, namely the Common Agricultural Policy or the CAP.  This policy is currently being renegotiated and its results will be critical for the future of this sector.  As the holder of the Presidency of the EU for the first six months of 2013, Ireland will have an influential role in finalising these discussions.  We need to ensure we have the maximum goodwill and support of all out EU partners to ensure the best deal possible is struck for this country.  A negative vote in the referendum would be very difficult.  In any negotiation process, one is dealing with human beings and if their view of us is that we are anti-European, it will not help us when we sit at the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I look forward to the upcoming campaign.  I want to go out and meet the people of Kildare and explain to them why I believe a "Yes" vote on 31 May is the only sure way to ensure Ireland continues on its path to recovery.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanGriffinFG" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin</from>
          <p eId="para_211">I wish to share my time with Deputy Seán Conlan.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I will be supporting this treaty because I firmly believe it is the right thing for Ireland at the right time.  I call on the people of the country, in particular the people of my constituency of Kerry South, to support it because it is the correct thing to do.  I thank many of the people who have already come out publicly in support of this treaty, particularly some of the groups and organisations such as the IFA which have come out very strongly in favour of the treaty because they recognise its many positive attributes.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I firmly believe there is nothing to be afraid of in this treaty and that it will be a very positive step for the country.  Ratifying it would provide access to the ESM which is very important for Ireland because it is not only a bailout option, it will also assist in terms of competition for when we return to the markets and it will help Ireland to secure better rates on the markets should we return to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">As was mentioned by previous speakers, ratification of the treaty would send out a positive signal to existing and potential investors in Ireland.  It is important that signal is sent out.  It would also lead to a combined effort on the European stage to ensure huge national budget deficits are avoided in the future.  That will happen for the countries that have ratified this treaty and it is important we are with them.  It will not, however, prevent over-dependence on unsustainable revenue measures in the future.  That is something about which we as a country need to be vigilant in the future.  We need to ensure our income methods are kept sustainable and realistic unlike what happened in the previous decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I call for as much information as possible to be put into the public domain so that people can make an informed decision.  I call for an objective debate on the issue and for the contributions from all parties to it to remain specifically on the issue and not to be diluted by side issues because that would be disingenuous and would not serve the country or its people.  What the people deserve is a focus specifically on the treaty and on issues pertaining to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">In regard to the logistics of the referendum, I have believed for a long time that all polling days in Ireland should be on a Saturday to allow maximum participation in the democratic process.  I call for future polling days to be held on a Saturday.  It would give people an opportunity to get to the ballot box and to exercise their democratic right.  Presiding officers, polling clerks and counting staff should come from the live register.  It would mean a great deal to those people.  At this time when so many people are struggling financially, it would be a fair measure to give those people an opportunity to earn some income.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Conlan</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the stability treaty.  I see the key function of the Government as restoring our economic independence and creating the correct conditions to get all Irish people back to work. Ten years of populist, incompetent Government have resulted in a diminution of Irish independence, mass unemployment, emigration and a public and private debt mountain which will cause hardship for this and the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I very much welcome the fact the people will have the opportunity to vote in the referendum on this treaty.  A "Yes" vote will help to prevent a return to bad, populist governments which always take the easy options and to the flawed economic policies of Cabinets containing Bertie Ahern , Brian Cowen, Deputy Micheál Martin, and Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív which destroyed this country.  How will we do this?  By insisting that future governments both here and in the rest of the eurozone implement balanced budgets as a norm, limit budget deficits to 3% in economic downturns and bring down debt-GDP ratios to 60% over a 20 year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">We are already doing much of what is contained in this treaty.  Ireland has already committed to reducing our deficit and this treaty merely formalises this process.  People who want to ensure future governments both here and in the rest of the eurozone have to adhere to sensible and responsible policies which minimise fluctuations in the economic cycle and prevent a return to the boom and bust policies of the past should vote "Yes" for this treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I believe passing this treaty will enhance our recovery programme as it will give us access to the ESM, a rescue fund of which we can avail if necessary.  It will enhance confidence within the business community that Ireland is a stable place in which to do business and invest.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">We cannot be sure of all the benefits which will result from passing this treaty but we cannot afford as a nation to limit our recovery potential with the uncertainty about our place in Europe that a "No" vote would engender.  Unlike previous referenda, Ireland does not have a veto on this treaty.  It will come into force on 1 January next regardless of how we vote.  Ireland is the only English speaking country in the eurozone.  This gives us great advantages in attracting foreign direct investment.  Recently we had the announcement of 1,000 new jobs in PayPal in Dundalk which will have very positive effects in my constituency and the whole of the north east.   It is important a "Yes" vote is secured because it will provide confidence to multinationals that Ireland continues to be a safe and stable place in which to invest to gain access to EU and eurozone markets.</p>

        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_221">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As I was preparing to speak, I saw young children on a school tour come into the Visitors Gallery.  I believe Deputy Ann Phelan has a school tour in and the young children on it are listening closely to the debate.  We all carry a heavy responsibility to ensure we make the right decisions and conduct this debate in a proper manner, keeping to the subject and importance of it.  Most people in this House will not bear the consequences of the decision on it.  It will be borne by the likes of the young children who are observing this debate this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I can well remember in the late 1990s when the Irish economy took off.   Historic negotiations were taking place for the euro to come into place.  The punt was replaced and many of the children in the Gallery would not even know what a punt was, but it was followed by reckless economic management.  The euro has driven growth across the Continent making trade, investment, tourism and travel much easier.  The European project has faced many challenges but the threat to the currency due to the huge debts run up by many countries threatens our small, open economy.  When the euro was set up, the Stability and Growth Pact formed the rules that would govern member states taking part.  Out of 27 states, 23 broke the original rules.  Greece never once met the criteria, keeping annual borrowing above 3% of GDP and not reducing debt.  In Ireland, we reduced debt but did so by running a credit-fuelled boom that we are all paying for now.  A common currency needs common rules.  The fact that no country took the previous rules seriously for the past 15 years leaves us in a position where we must stabilise the euro and bring certainty to the economy.  The stability treaty will allow us through legislation to bring into force the rules we must follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">By no means is this treaty the solution to all our problems but it is one of the many steps we must take.  People opposing the treaty expect other European countries to lend us the money without any conditions, as if we have an automatic right to their taxpayers' money, but if we need access to the ESM, and I sincerely hope we will not, Germany and others will have to fund that.  All European countries have an interest in ensuring the rules work.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">We are at the edge of Europe and investors can choose to invest in Germany or Ireland.  That is why we need certainty to encourage foreign direct investment.  The treaty is an important part of securing that confidence and rebuilding the trust in the Irish economy.  My own constituency has benefited from foreign direct investment, with many tech companies locating in the so-called silicon dock, rejuvenating the inner city.  Anyone taking a trip into the Ringsend-Pearse Street area will see strong financial growth.  That is the answer to our debt problem, but without stability across the eurozone, it is more difficult in Ireland.  Between 1991 and 2000, when there was real economic growth, sovereign debt went from 95% of GDP to 35% as a result of that growth.  We must repeat that miracle but that can only happen with a stable euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">When considering if we needed a referendum, one woman approached my wife and said we should have the referendum because she never wanted to see another generation saddled with debt, and that if we went through the pain, we would have to ensure the next lot could not sink us again.  The referendum will help achieve that.  We cannot gamble with the futures of the children watching today.  I ask people to support the treaty.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_226">On Easter Sunday the Taoiseach and other Cabinet Ministers, as well as Oireachtas Members, myself included, stood outside the GPO and listened to the words of the Proclamation.  As I speak on the austerity treaty today, I wonder did the Cabinet Ministers hear the same words that I heard: "We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible."  The Cabinet that stood to hear those words now asks us to put before the people for approval a treaty that flies in the face of the 1916 Proclamation.  It is a treaty that seeks to negate the right of the Irish people to the ownership of Ireland.  It is a treaty that would surrender control of Irish destinies and fetter this and future elected governments, tying them to the failed economics of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The people would have expected such a surrender from the last Government.  It reeks of the dying days of the Fianna Fáil regime.  This was the Government that collapsed the economy, built a pipeline to pour public money into the banking black hole and brought in the troika.  All of these things were denounced in no uncertain terms by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party while in opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Now what do we find?  Not only are the billions still being paid out to bank boldholders, not only is the troika diktat still firmly in place, but we now also have a treaty that seeks to tie this State to an austerity programme that will prolong the recession precipitated by Fianna Fáil.  As we speak, people are still reeling from the prospect of the latest imposition of water taxes, with both a flat annual charge and a charge for use and the threat of cut-off if they do not pay.  This has come hot on the heels of the debacle of the household charge.  Cuts in pay, cuts in education, cuts in health, cuts in social protection, cuts in health care, privatisation of State assets - this is austerity in action.  This is the direct result of the surrender to the troika and much, much more of this is what Fine Gael and the Labour Party want the people to vote "Yes" to on 31 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Without a blush the Tánaiste and his Labour Party colleagues have dumped their pre-election promises to the electorate.  The red flag has been cast aside, despite the weekend's annual conference, and the blueshirt hairshirt is now firmly in control.  Where now is the Labour refrain, heard throughout the 29th and 30th Dáil that taxes should be based on ability to pay and that those who can pay more should pay more?  Where now is the warning from the Labour Party of the stealth taxes and charges that would be imposed by Fine Gael?  The Tánaiste and his colleagues made these points repeatedly in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Speaking in the Seanad yesterday the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said it is time "to hang up ideology" for a short while.  I was astonished Deputy Howlin would utter those words.  He was defending the privatisation of State assets.  There is certainly no doubt that the Labour Party has hung up its ideology and its policies, particularly given the Minister's utterances and his actions and those of his colleagues in Government in the past 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">What of Fine Gael?  It received a very substantial mandate last year but on the basis that it promised change and a new direction.  Far from setting a new direction, it has carried on with the legacy of Fianna Fáil.  There is not a hair's breadth difference between the two.  To this they have added an air of arrogance and self-righteousness, as personified by the Minister for hardship himself, the Tánaiste's Cabinet colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan, and by the backbench Fine Gael chorus of hecklers - none of whom is here now, thank God - who seem to have little else to contribute to this Dáil.  Now these parties want the people to approve the austerity treaty to set in constitutional concrete the failed policy that has brought us mass unemployment and emigration, cuts to vital public services and stealth taxes that punish low and middle income earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Those who doubt what we say about this treaty need only heed the words of one of its chief authors, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.  She left no ambiguity about its huge implications when she said: "The debt brakes will be binding and valid forever.  Never will you be able to change them through a parliamentary majority."  The long-term nature of the treaty was also highlighted by ICTU economist Paul Sweeney who has said, "This treaty will contribute ... to making things worse because it is essentially a coup by the right wing economic conservatives to impose fiscal austerity on us forever."  Bernadette Ségol, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_233">It is intended only to reassure markets.  This agreement offers no long-term prospects for restoring employment and sustainable growth.  Its sole objective is to tighten fiscal discipline and to have such discipline written into national constitutions or legislation.  Europe must not become synonymous with sanctions and rigid fiscal policies.  It must be identified with prosperity and must offer prospects for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Perhaps the most clear sighted analysis so far has been provided by the economist Michael Taft in his presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.  He has pointed out that the Government estimates the structural deficit will be 3.7% in 2015 and that under the treaty it would have to reduce it to 0.5%.  This could require fiscal adjustments of over €8 billion, a doubling of the austerity measures the Government has planned in the next three years.  Many economists and responsible commentators point out that the treaty will depress growth in the eurozone, having a negative impact on foreign demand for Irish goods and services.  Far from stabilising the eurozone, many economists believe it will destabilise it.  As Michael Taft stated: "The fiscal treaty will perpetuate instability in the eurozone ... depressing economic growth during a period of stagnation will undermine confidence in an economy's ability to generate the future revenue needed to repay its debts."  If the treaty had been in force in past decades, the State would not have been able to build up its infrastructure, from the ESB to telecommunications to transport.  The positive growth at the start of the Celtic tiger period might not have been possible but the bubble would have been permitted.  To quote Michael Taft again: "During a period of productive economic growth, the treaty would have depressed growth and employment.  However, this same treaty would have validated an economy which was over-heating on speculative growth."</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The treaty is a recipe for further recession.  It is based on failed, right-wing economics that are condemning millions across Europe to misery.  Once again the Government is trying to frighten the electorate by pretending that the State will receive no funds from the European Union and that it will be thrown out of the eurozone.  That is patent nonsense.  It is the politics of fear, nothing else.  This is the time for real courage.  The people will be acting in their own interests and those of their children - contrary to what was said by an earlier speaker - if they reject the treaty.  They will be reclaiming ownership of Ireland for the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The elite in Brussels and Frankfurt will lament an Irish "No" vote - let them do so.  However, millions of citizens across the European Union will thank us if we say "No" to austerity and "Yes" to an economy in Europe that serves people rather than bankers and speculators.  As the first voice today outlining the argument in support of a "No" vote on 31 May, I call on people to use their vote wisely and in their and their children's interests by delivering a resounding and overwhelming "No" vote to the austerity treaty.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_237">On 31 May the people will go to the polls in one of the most important referendums the State has held since its foundation.  They deserve a frank and honest debate on this issue, as there is too much at stake.  The campaign must focus on the facts rather than the fantasy.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I listened to the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore's contribution on this issue on Wednesday.  I will quote one part of his speech in which he outlined the reasons for voting "Yes".  He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_239">I am voting "Yes" because I believe it helps us.  My point today is that voting "No" genuinely will not help Ireland's recovery, it will hinder it ... If the stability treaty is about anything, it is about making sure grave mistakes are not made again.  It is about getting a sustainable, fair and people focused economy here in Ireland and across Europe, where public money is available for public services and job incentives, not for paying down debt.  In addition, as I have said on many occasions, it is about the euro in our pocket.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I disagree with the Tánaiste's analysis for a number of reasons.  Saying "No" to the treaty will not hinder Ireland, rather it will strengthen its position within the European Union.  Saying "No" will mean Irish sovereignty over its fiscal responsibilities will not be further eroded.  How can this be bad for the people?  The Government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth on this issue.  One day it tells the people that it is working hard to regain our sovereignty as it is imperative that we regain control of our finances if we are ever to grow the economy and get back to a situation where we are not reliant on bailout funds.  How can it claim this is its primary objective while proposing a treaty that does the opposite?</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The Tánaiste has said the treaty is about getting to a position where public money will be used to fund public services and provide job creation incentives.  The Government has not shown anything in the last 12 months to suggest it is working to achieve this.  We have seen how it has been willingly handing over public money to private bondholders to the detriment of public services and job creation measures.  It is clear from the recent deal on the promissory note that the Government is committed to doing this for many years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The single statement on which I agree with the Tánaiste is that this is all about the euro in our pocket.  Unfortunately for the people, if the treaty is passed, many of them will have far fewer euros in their pockets.  Acceptance of the treaty will mean a further €5 billion to €6 billion worth of cuts and savings will have to be found after 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The people have suffered enough.  It is time for a change of direction to one which gives people some hope there will be an end to austerity.  Voting for the treaty will do the opposite.  It will enshrine austerity into law and extinguish any hope the State has of getting off its knees and standing tall again.  Voting for the treaty will ultimately mean deeper cuts in health care, education and local communities.  It will mean more unjust stealth taxes such as the household tax and water charges, which will do nothing but punish struggling families.  The Oireachtas will be undermined in that even greater decision making powers in economic and fiscal policy matters will be handed over to unelected officials in the European Union.  The treaty is about creating a one-size-fits-all fiscal approach.  This is a flawed concept and while it might sound good in theory, the reality is very different.  A one-size-fits-all approach, particularly one embedded in the concept of austerity, would be a major mistake for the State and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Recent statements by various Ministers have given us an insight into the rhetoric they will use during the campaign.  We are told that the treaty is about Ireland being at the heart of the European Union, as if to suggest rejecting it will leave us isolated.  We are told the treaty is about job creation and putting in place the mechanisms required for the economy to recover.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Rejection of the treaty will not result in Ireland being thrown out of the European Union or the eurozone.  The treaty is not about job creation.  Its supporters tell us that we must live within our means and that it will help Ireland to achieve this.  I agree that Ireland must live within its means, but the main reason we are unable to do so is the unsustainable debt lumbered on the shoulders of the people as a result of bailing out bondholders and speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Another myth being peddled concerns the notion that Sinn Féin is anti-European Union.  This is not true.  Sinn Féin believes partnership within the European Union should be based on independent sovereign states working for their mutual benefit.  Our relationship with the Union should be engaged, confident, proactive and critical, where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I wish to address a point the Government repeats daily, that rejection of the treaty will deny Ireland access to funds if we require them in the future beyond the current bailout programme.  To suggest that if we reject the austerity treaty, we will be denied European Stability Mechanism funding is simply not true.  The blackmail clause, as it is known, is an empty threat.  It has little, if any, legal force and conflicts with the primary mandate of the ESM to safeguard the stability of the eurozone as a whole, as written into the EU treaties.  Let us be clear also that this is not the only source of emergency funding available to member states that find themselves frozen out of the sovereign markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">As the ESM has not yet been ratified by the State, the Government continues to have a veto over it.  If it wanted, it could seek the removal of this blackmail clause.  Unfortunately, however, Ministers know that without it the prospect of winning the referendum on the austerity treaty is greatly lessened.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In our Private Members' motion last month Sinn Féin called on the Government to delay ratification of the ESM until after the austerity treaty referendum because it would allow a free and fair debate on the merits of the treaty, free from bullying or blackmail.  The Government has since taken the first step in the right direction by delaying ratification of the ESM until after the austerity treaty referendum.  I welcome this move.  The Government now needs to remove this threat to the people and make it clear that if they reject the treaty, Ireland will go to the European Council and secure the removal of the blackmail clause, using the veto, if required.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Ireland is in the driving seat as the only country which is holding a referendum on the treaty.  There is great support behind us from hard-pressed citizens in other European states who will not have the opportunity to have a say on the treaty.  Everyone is looking to see what we do on it.  I urge the people to vote "No", not just for the sake of Ireland but for the sake of the European Union.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_250">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Referendum day, 31 May, will be an important and defining day for the country, our future relationship with the European Union and the future of the euro.  In the past 12 months the Government has worked hard to repair our international credibility and has succeeded.  There is renewed optimism about Ireland and international investor confidence is starting to return.  The number of foreign direct investment projects was up 20% last year; job announcements such as those made by PayPal, Mylan and Apple are testament to the increased confidence in Ireland and the prospects for future projects coming here are positive.  If the economy continues to stabilise, we must work with our EU partners to put in place the mechanisms needed to ensure economic stability throughout the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">We are an island nation on the edge of Europe and must learn from the lessons of the past and the events of recent years.  We cannot stick our heads in the sand, as some opposition Deputies would like us to do, and ignore the influence of international factors, including international market sentiment, on our economic stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Opponents of the treaty claim it will not fix the eurozone crisis or the economy.  I take issue with these misinformed comments.  The treaty is an essential element of the road map out of the crisis.  It is an important part of the package needed to stabilise economic conditions in Europe because it provides assurances that the problems that emerged in Greece cannot be repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">When the people go to the polls on 31 May, I ask them to reflect on the role of the incompetence shown.  Light touch regulation and the lack of corporate enforcement brought the country to its knees.  I am conscious of the difficulties many ordinary people have to endure because of the sins of the past.  However, the treaty presents an opportunity for the people to draw a line under the events of the past by putting in place the structures and procedures required to prevent Irish Governments from engaging in reckless economic mismanagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The treaty also presents the people with an opportunity to vote confidence in the euro.  A strong eurozone will raise all boats and is pivotal to Ireland's economic recovery.  Our exports are the real success story of the economy.  Last year they grew by 4.1%.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I look forward to engaging with my constituents during the course of the campaign.  I will be urging the people of County Clare to put on the green jersey on 31 May and ensure a "Yes" vote to ensure Ireland's continued recovery.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_256">I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate which will continue for the next six weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">A "Yes" vote in next month's EU fiscal treaty referendum will be a vital step in turning around the economic fortunes of the country.  However, the treaty may be ten or 12 years too late.  If the rules it will introduce had been in place at the time, we might not have the economic problems we face.  However, we are where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The treaty is vital for the future of the youth of the country because it is necessary to restore economic confidence and ensure Ireland's future place at the heart of the European Union.  It is also crucial for all businesses where goods and services are traded internationally, particularly the agrifood industry, in respect of which rising export levels have provided a welcome good news story in recent months.  The extent to which business leaders recognise the vital role a "Yes" vote to the treaty can play is evidenced by the fact that Chambers Ireland has stated it is vital in restoring confidence in Ireland and will support employment, as well as guaranteeing future access to the ESM, a crucial consideration in these times of international economic volatility.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The timing of the referendum could not be more crucial for Irish agriculture.  Talks on the Common Agricultural Policy are taking place and due to conclude in the next 12 months.  It is crucial that Ireland be seen to be at the heart of the European Union during this process.  Irish negotiators have long held a significant position at these negotiations, working for the betterment of farmers such as those in the west, and their position will only be strengthened by the people demonstrating a commitment to working towards a stronger future within the the European Union.  The fiscal compact treaty is about getting the European Union back on track.  It is particularly important for Irish agriculture that Ireland be part of a strong trading bloc and a common currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The treaty is a small step in getting the European Union back on the right road and the European economy back on track.  The best interests of the people will be served by a "Yes" vote.  Our debate on such an important issue must not be sidetracked.  The debate must focus solely on the fiscal compact treaty and what it means for Ireland.  The treaty, unlike previous treaties, is relatively compact and a reiteration of our signing up to necessary economic safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">We should not lose sight of the importance to Ireland of the European Stability Mechanism which has proved crucial in allowing Ireland to access funds to meet day-to-day spending, public service salaries, pensions and social welfare payments for the 436,000 people currently seeking work.  Turning our backs on this fund at a time of unprecedented volatility in world and particularly European markets would be economic folly on an unprecedented scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I strongly advocate a "Yes" vote on 31 May and urge everyone, on all sides of the House, who wants to see Ireland at the centre of a strong common currency area and a solid trading bloc to support the treaty in the referendum.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_263">The economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 has, undoubtedly, resulted in one of the most pronounced recessions in the world economy since the 1930s.  The new stability treaty constitutes a solid fiscal framework that would effectively discourage fiscal deviations and, eventually, lead to sound public finances.  The treaty sets in stone a reinforced surveillance mechanism and makes provision for the co-ordination of economic policies.  It will further strengthen fiscal discipline in the euro area.  Commonly agreed fiscal rules will be inscribed in international legislation which, in turn, should help the eurozone to regain trust and credibility.  These are the values that are fundamental in overcoming the economic crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">To a large extent, there is also a crisis of confidence.  Consumers, businesses and markets are uncertain what the future will bring.  This has serious consequences for growth prospects owing to its effects on both investments and consumption.  Bringing public deficit and debt ratios back to a sound and sustainable path through credible fiscal strategies is a precondition for restoring confidence and, thereby, stimulating growth.  Crucially, a "Yes" vote will mean Ireland will be able to gain access to the permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">This week the Taoiseach said the advantage of ratifying the treaty with a strong "Yes" vote was a continued insurance policy for Ireland.  A "Yes" vote will also provide a guarantee that no Government will ever run riot with either the people's fortunes or money.  Instability and uncertainty have affected every citizen and the treaty gives us the opportunity to put in place new limits on public debt and budget deficits, providing stability for Ireland's domestic finances and across the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The week the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland stated the perspective of US multinational investors in Ireland was that a "Yes" vote would promote stability, investment and growth in the economy.  By voting "Yes" we will maintain our position as an attractive location for investment, continue to put in place the necessary economic and budgetary reforms and preserve our strategically important place in the European Union.  A "Yes" vote will reassure international investors that Ireland is dealing with its fiscal problems and stabilising its economy and help to protect the country as a location for foreign investment.  Under the Government, the country has a plan for recovery.  The stability treaty is a further step in the right direction, generating momentum in the economy to drive growth.  The country must restore its confidence; it needs the treaty.  Therefore, it must vote "Yes".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_267">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on the treaty which has been called many things from an "austerity treaty" to a "fiscal compact" to a "stability treaty".  What one calls it depends on the way one wants to look at it, which will decide the approach one takes.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The euro currency covers 17 countries.  When this country decided that it should join the Economic and Monetary Union, it did so because it was in our best interests to do so.  An overwhelming majority of the people decided that it was in our best interests to be part of the euro currency.  We joined the full union on 1 January 2002 and have been part of it since.  That is still the message from those who need a stable and strong currency.  Those who have doubts about the treaty should listen to people outside the Chamber or the political sphere, those who deal in international trade.  They are the ones who understand the importance of having access to a market, in a simple and straightforward way, by virtue of being part of a single, strong currency and remaining at the heart of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">We must bear in mind that the euro is only ten years old.  It is in its infancy in terms of the lifespan of a currencyand we did not get everything right at the start.  One of the things we did not get right was taking prudent, preventive measures to stop the debt burden problem arising.  We are dealing with the legacy of this now.  It amuses me to hear those who refer to the treaty as an "austerity treaty" and say it will hamstring us for the rest of our days.  They are the same people who said reckless lending, borrowing and a lack of prudence led us into the current mess.  We must remember that if and when the treaty is ratified, it will not apply to this country until after 2015, when we are out of recovery mode.  The treaty is about the introduction of preventive measures to stop the same pattern recurring.  If I run a business or a household budget for a family, when I have a surplus, I save it and when I have a deficit, I either use my savings or seek a facility to borrow.  That is what we are talking about - keeping our finances within wise and prudent parameters in order that we can never again overstretch an economy and put such a burden on the public and future generations.  That is what the treaty is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I return to those outside the political sphere calling for a "Yes" vote.  They are the people who understand how important it is that we have a currency that is at the core of the European economy.  As the single, biggest exporting country within the eurozone and the European Union, it is daft to think we could consider putting ourselves outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Reference has been made to using our power of veto over the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, treaty.  That is not the language we should use when for the past three or four years we have been and are trying to work with others to cut us a better deal.  The same people now say we should veto proceedings if we do not like what has been put in front of us.  The notion that by saying "No" this time we will strengthen our hand, if and when there is another treaty, is nonsense.  Whatever about the validity of the argument made in the context of the Lisbon treaty, that does not hold true in this case because as soon as 1 January 2013 arrives and 12 countries have ratified the treaty, one is either with them or one is not.  It will be too late to join after that.  We would be outside the door knocking on it and asking to come in.  Introducing a veto would weaken our hand rather than strengthen it.  I, therefore, urge people to judge the treaty on its merits and not to introduce other grievances.  I urge them to listen to what is being said about the treaty and its merits.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_272">I express my thanks and appreciation to the Members who have contributed to this important debate.  This is extremely important legislation which will facilitate the holding of a referendum on the stability treaty on Thursday, 31 May.  I have already said to the House that the treaty is critical to the future of the country.  If it is about anything, it is about making sure the costly mistakes of the past are not repeated.  It is about having a sustainable, fair and people-focused economy in this country and across Europe.  We want to have public money, the euro, available for public services and job incentives, not for paying down debt.  As I have said on many occasions, this is about the euro in our pocket.  This is a matter of vital interest for every man, woman and child in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I heard Deputy Sandra McLellan and other speakers take issue with this position in the course of the debate.  They also took issue with the assertion I made that a "Yes" vote in ratification of the treaty was important for the country, would be good for its people and that a "No" vote would be damaging.  Let me be clear: if we reject the treaty, there will be consequences.  At a minimum, we would contribute to continuing uncertainty and instability about the euro.  I would like to hear someone explain to me how it is in the interests of any worker in this country that there be doubt about the value of the euro, the currency in which they are paid.  I would also like an explanation of how it is in the interests of those on pensions or coming close to pension age that there be doubt about the value of the currency in which their pensions are paid.  I would like to hear how it is in the interests of anyone with small savings that the value of these savings be in doubt.  At a minimum, it would send a message about our relationship with the euro to the very people we want to invest in this country to create jobs.  One of the things I know from the work I do as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is that one of the first questions asked by investors, including potential investors, these days is not about the state of the economy but about the state of the European economy and the stability of the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">We have been doing very well.  Happily, today we hear another major announcement of a significant number of jobs being created in Cork.  It comes on the back of several other announcements in recent weeks, all of which are the result of the work we have been doing in building and rebuilding this country's reputation and assuring investors that this is a good place in which to invest.  We do not want to put this at risk by sending a message that the country is somehow ambiguous about the euro and its future.  In addition, a "No" vote would pull away the safety net of the European Stability Mechanism, to which I hope as a country we will never need to have recourse, but if we did need, it is highly unwise of anyone to argue that it should be pulled away.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The argument seems to be made from the benches opposite by those who are arguing against the treaty that somehow if it is rejected, phoenix-like, a new European economy will emerge and all of ur financial difficulties will simply be wiped away.  That is not the case.  If the treaty is rejected, on the following day we will still have a deficit that must be dealt with.  As I said at the Oireachtas committee, there is a deficit of €13.7 billion to bridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">It is interesting that the very people who are arguing against this treaty are also those who are saying we should default, in which case we would not have access to private funding.  They are the people who have been saying that the troika and its money should be sent away from the country so that we do not have access to the emergency funding that we now have under the programme.  Thirdly, they are saying that we should not have the European Stability Mechanism either, and some have gone so far, I understand, as to suggest that the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism should be vetoed or blocked.  How on earth would we bridge the €13.7 billion?  The Government has a plan for the bridging of that deficit.  It is a plan which involves a graduated reduction of our deficit over a number of years coupled with a strategy which we have set out, both for this country and for Europe, for the creation of jobs and economic growth that will bring about the lift that we need to get out of our economic difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The opponents of this treaty are going around arguing that the passing of this treaty will result in prolonged austerity in this country.  The reverse is the case.  The rejection of this treaty is what will result in prolonged austerity for this country.  The opponents of this treaty have to date not put forward a single credible idea as to how the deficit for this country can be reduced.  Where will Deputy Ó Caoláin get the €13.7 billion to bridge the gap?  If one pulls away the emergency funding, if one pulls away the programme we already have, if one rejects the idea of borrowing money on the private markets or having access to it, how will one bridge the funding?  Where will one have the money to pay nurses, teachers and gardaí, to pay social welfare payments, to keep schools and hospitals running?  It is time to lift the head out of the abracadabra type of economics that has been promoted by some of those arguing against this treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The decision that we collectively, as the Irish people, will take at the end of May will have real consequences for the future of this country.  The Government believes it will say a great deal about where we stand, about our aspirations for the future, about who we are and where we are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">We have a burden of responsibility to ensure we fully equip the Irish people with all the information and understanding they need to make an informed choice on 31 May.  That is why we have launched the most comprehensive Government information campaign ever held for a European referendum.  Yesterday, we launched a dedicated website - <i>stabilitytreaty.ie</i> - so everyone can read the treaty and have it explained to them, article by article.  The website is available also in mobile format and has links to both Facebook and Twitter.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In early May, every home in the land will receive a copy of the treaty, with explanatory material printed in both Irish and English.  Closer to polling day, every home will get another information note to help voters make their final decision as well-informed as possible.  We will spare no effort to inform the Irish people.  The debate underway in this House is a vital part of these efforts.  I again compliment the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, and its Chairman, Deputy Hannigan, for the work it has been doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I have carefully followed the debate here and am struck by the need to address a few key issues which I believe have not yet been genuinely and honestly treated by all participating in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">My firm view, as I stated, is that voting "No" will not help Ireland's recovery; it will hinder it.  Those who claim that this treaty is about austerity are plain wrong.  Let us be clear about one matter.  The treaty is about managing our debt in such a way that, over time, taxpayers' money goes, not into servicing debts but increasingly into public services and targeted growth initiatives to create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">As a small open economy, we have seen in dramatic fashion how quickly our public finances can become unstable in the face of global economic turbulence.  We cannot allow that to happen again.  Even if we were not party to the treaty, as a matter of proper economic management, we would have to reduce our indebtedness over time.  Those who make claims about the treaty imposing austerity seem to believe that one can run a deficit forever, or accumulate debt without limit; one cannot.  As I said earlier this week, that is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of mathematics.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">We also have heard much in this debate about the value of access to the European Stability Mechanism, the ESM.  Some opponents of this treaty try to argue that linking the ESM to this treaty is some form of blackmail.  This is fundamentally disingenuous.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">There also has been the argument that we can veto the ESM, and I want to clear that up as well.  First, as I emphasised already, the suggestions that we should seek to veto our insurance policy does not make practical sense.  From the strictly legal perspective, we do not have a veto.  The ESM treaty does not require unanimity to enter into force.  It simply requires ratification by the states whose collective contribution to the funds in the ESM amounts to 90%.  It is true that the amendment to Article 136 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU requires unanimity but as this amendment is purely for the purpose of clarifying that the member states may establish the ESM, it is not necessary for it to enter into force before the ESM is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">As I see it, the link in this treaty to the ESM is essentially about having an insurance policy, ensure we have access, if needed, to the funding that allows us to fund public services and all Government spending.  We are determined to return to the financial markets next year, to stand on our own two feet again.  We are on target with our programme, and sentiment towards Ireland is positive, and yet we cannot control world events and the world economy.  Markets need to know there is a backup in the form of the European Stability Mechanism and we can only access that if we ratify this treaty on 31 May.  Who would argue that it is in Ireland's interests that we be excluded from the ESM?  Who could advocate that we invite all the uncertainty that would bring and most of all, where are the other sources of funding that opponents claim to be an alternative?</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Finally, this treaty is fundamentally about efforts that we are making to restore confidence in us as a country in which to invest and to do business.  Personally, I have been impressed in my contacts with investors and employers about the high premium they put on Ireland being part of a stable eurozone.  These are the people who are creating jobs in this country and their confidence in us matters.  They want to do business in Europe and they are convinced by what Ireland has to offer as a European base, but they need reassurance that the euro currency is stable and that Ireland's is a stable and well managed economy at the heart of the eurozone.  A vote in favour of this treaty will bolster this confidence as a place in which to invest and create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Government will not shy away from playing its full part in informing the Irish people in honest terms about what is at stake in this important vote.  This is not a time for the registering of protests or to use the vote on this treaty for unassociated issues.  Many of the difficult decisions the Government must make on a daily basis to help get this economy back on a stable footing require hardship and sacrifice and I very much regret that we find ourselves in that position as a country, but we will continue to work, night and day, to fix this.  I am convinced that a "Yes" vote in this referendum is an essential contribution to that effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I have never claimed that the stability treaty, on its own, is the solution to all of our problems, but it is an important part of the solution to them.  In addition to this stability treaty, as the Taoiseach stated at the European Council meeting in January, we also need a jobs and growth strategy in Europe in order for Europe to get out of its economic difficulties, but it is manifestly clear that we also must ensure that the euro - the currency in which we are paid, which we spend when we have it and which we save whenever we can - is secure and that the insecurity around it that we saw last year, which had such a potentially damaging effect on investment in Europe, and particularly here in Ireland, is settled.  That is, essentially, what this treaty is about - putting into treaty form the rules governing the shared and common currency.  It is in all our interests that there is stability in the eurozone.  It is in our interests because that stability will inspire confidence in those who invest in this country, and also encourage domestic confidence which, of course, we need to see increase in order for economic recovery to come about.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The "Yes" vote in this referendum is an important decision that every individual must make in the privacy of the ballot booth reflecting on the implications of that decisions for the euro in his or her pocket, for his or her own future in terms of job opportunities and, in particular, for the future of his or her children.  It is not a panacea, but it is an important part of the recovery package that the country needs and we should not put it at risk.  Cuireadh an cheist.</p>

Before Committee Stage commences I wish to deal with a procedural matter relating to Bills to amend the Constitution.  The substance of the debate on Committee Stage relates to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment contained in the Schedule to the Bill.  The sections of the Bill are merely technical.  Therefore, in accordance with long-standing practice the sections are postponed until consideration of the Schedule has been completed.  I propose that consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill be postponed until the Schedule is disposed of.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_406">I have made it clear that I will not be supporting the treaty.  I have tabled an amendment to the wording.  I have some concerns about the wording.  Although I am opposed to the treaty, this does not mean I should not seek to lessen the damage in terms of the wording.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I examined the wording of other European Union treaties.  The wording proposed for this treaty is similar to three previous European treaties, the accession treaty, the Maastricht treaty and the Lisbon treaty.  The Maastricht and Lisbon treaties were consolidating measures to amend the accession treaty.  The accession treaty dealt with the ceding of some of our sovereignty, the recognition of the European Union Court of Justice and governance arrangements for the European Union.  That is putting the matter at its simplest.  However, they also represented something beyond that.  They were about connecting us to those institutions.  The Maastricht and Lisbon treaties were acts of consolidation and had to carry forward the same wording.  One passage included in those treaties states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_408">No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union or of the Communities, or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the European Union or by the Communities or by institutions thereof, or by bodies competent under the Treaties establishing the Communities, from having the force of law in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The language we use says everything about the pecking order in terms of what we have in the Constitution.  For example, the questions on the Nice treaty, the Single European Act and the Amsterdam treaty had simpler wording, asking whether we would agree to ratify the changes.  However, they did not have the additional wording, including the passage above.  Essentially, those treaties were below the accession treaty in the pecking order.  The three treaties I have referred to, the accession treaty, the Maastricht treaty and the Lisbon treaty, are the heavyweights.  Heavyweight treaties have heavyweight ramifications and therefore it was necessary to have heavyweight wording.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The European Union is a rounded and complex set of institutions.  There are democratic and legal components.  However, an intergovernmental treaty is a different entity.  There is a need for a constitutional referendum in the case of a European Union treaty.  However, this is not a European Union treaty, it is an intergovernmental treaty.  We are not being asked one question but two questions.  The first  question should, following the simple wording used in, for example, the Single European Act, have as its answer something like, "We agree to ratify this treaty".  However, we are being asked something beyond that.  We are being asked to put this treaty on a par with the European Union accession treaty and the subsequent consolidating treaties, yet it has no democratic component to it and the legal competence of the European Court of Justice is clearly within the European legislation.  It is a matter of serious concern that this treaty is being placed shoulder to shoulder in the pecking order with the heavyweight European treaties.  Article 5 of the Constitution states that Ireland is an "independent, sovereign, democratic state".  It has been pointed out to me in the past that the Constitution must be read harmoniously when it comes to inserting additional text.  In this case, the Constitution cannot be read harmoniously because what is being inserted amounts to a paradox.  If we are a democratic State we should not agree to a wording that cedes competences to an intergovernmental entity.  To do so is in itself, apart from any other consideration, anti-democratic.  There is a paradox there.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Citizens, in their wisdom, agreed to share sovereignty with the European Union, which is an evolving entity.  The objectives of the European project are the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity among member states and the building of a highly competitive social market aimed at full employment and social progress.  This intergovernmental treaty prevents that from happening because there is a particular economic philosophy driving it.  Jürgen Habermas, a German philosopher, put it well when he said that Europe has embarked on a new kind of integration where intergovernmentalism takes the lead in what he calls an arrangement for exercising a type of "post-democratic, bureaucratic rule".  That is precisely the point I am making, that the treaty is anti or post-democratic.  The wording we are proposing to insert in the Constitution in this respect is not consistent with our claim to be a democratic State.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">There have been claims from many quarters to the effect that we have lost our sovereignty as a consequence of the EU-IMF bailout.  That is not accurate.  We have lost the ability to fund our services and repay our debts, but we have not loss our sovereignty.  It is dangerous to claim otherwise because when people consider that something is gone they do not fight for it.  It is important to make that point.  There are people throughout Europe making the case in regard to the lack of democracy attaching to what is proposed.  For instance, a former German Minister of Justice, Dr. Herta Däubler-Gmelin, has described the treaty as crossing a red line by taking away the competence of national parliaments to determine national budgets.  It is interesting that this view is coming from Germany.  Under the treaty, the European Commission and Council will gain power over national budgets without the involvement of the European Parliament or national parliaments.  This will have the effect of diluting voter influence on economic and social policy in Europe.  Dr. Däubler-Gmelin is arguing that this is repugnant to the German constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Another cause for concern is that it is not at all clear whether the European Stability Mechanism can be ended, as Professor Gerry Whyte observed at one of the meetings of the Sub-Committee on the Referendum on the Intergovernmental Treaty.  Dr. Däubler-Gmelin is essentially saying the same thing.  If this amendment is inserted into the Constitution we cannot, in five years' time when our circumstances will hopefully have improved, have another constitutional amendment seeking to delete it.  Ratifying the referendum will cede important governmental competences to an intergovernmental entity.  There is nothing written into the treaty to put the brakes on that or reverse it.  As such, we are set on a dangerous course.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">On the economic aspect, we tend to view national debt in household terms.  However, while households have a finite life span, countries do not, which is why the latter roll over debt.  I do not want to get into the economic arguments because I have had an opportunity to voice my concerns in that regard both at the sub-committee and on Second Stage.  As I have outlined, the wording of the amendment would have the effect of placing the proposed intergovernmental entity on an equal footing, under the Constitution, with the European Union.  In addition, it is a one-dimensional proposal from which the whole social and democratic component is absent.  That is very dangerous in its own right.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I am opposing Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment.  On the basis of the advice from the Attorney General, the Government has agreed the text of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, the purpose of which is, first, to ratify the stability treaty and, second, to provide appropriate constitutional cover for implementing measures necessitated by the treaty.  We in Ireland have a long and proud tradition of honouring our international treaty commitments and the Attorney General has advised that the current wording is the most appropriate means of ensuring we can do so in this case.  As I explained, it is our view that both elements of the proposed wording are essential.  They reflect the constitutional template already in the Constitution for the implementation of European Union law into Irish domestic law, which has served us well.  The proposed wording does not have the effect of making the treaty part of our Constitution.  Rather, it enables us to ratify the treaty and to take the necessary implementing measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Deputy Murphy argues her case on two essential bases, the first being that this treaty is of lesser weight or order than earlier EU treaties.  She makes the point that the Amsterdam and Nice treaties do not contain a sentence similar to the one she is seeking to delete - the necessitated sentence, if I can call it that - whereas the accession, Maastricht and Lisbon treaties do.  The reason for this is not that the Amsterdam and Nice treaties were somehow lower in status than other treaties but that they were purely amending treaties with no stand alone provision, whereas the stability treaty is a stand alone treaty, like the Maastricht treaty, although it is closely linked to the EU treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The Deputy also argues that because it is an intergovernmental and not an EU treaty, we do not need to make this commitment.  She points out the nature of this particular treaty in making her case for the amendment.  Although this is an intergovernmental treaty, a key concern for Ireland throughout the negotiations was to ensure it stuck as closely as possible to existing EU treaties and law and provided for appropriate involvement for the EU institutions.  We are strong supporters of the Union and that was an important issue for us in the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">These concerns are reflected in Article 2 of the stability treaty which makes it clear that the treaty must be in conformity with the European Union treaties.  There are many references to existing European law throughout the treaty.  The treaty also provides for the involvement of the European Union institutions and a role for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This role mirrors that which was introduced for the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Lisbon treaty, which was an innovation that was widely lauded, even by those who otherwise were not supportive of that treaty.  I oppose Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment for these reasons.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_419">The Tánaiste has stated Ireland has a tradition of including wording to ensure it meets its European or international obligations.  However, Members also have domestic obligations to citizens and the lack of a democratic component to this intergovernmental entity conflicts with such obligations.  I consider this democratic element to be extremely important.  I am fairly sure it was the Lisbon treaty that enhanced the role of the European Parliament in strengthening democratic oversight of the European Union.  This happened because it was generally acknowledged that people were moving away from or were less supportive of the Union.  I acknowledge this is partially due to people, including Members, blaming the European Union for particular matters when it was inappropriate to so do.  Nevertheless, while an enhanced role was provided for the European Parliament to strengthen the democratic component of the European Union, this measure proposes going into reverse gear in this regard.  The entire democratic aspect is pretty much being replaced by bureaucracy and the stronger countries in Europe which, essentially, are dictating what should take place.  While I do not believe the Tánaiste and I will agree on this issue, I emphasise strongly my belief democracy will lose today, even if the people have an opportunity to vote in the referendum.  This is because the wording, if passed, will dilute the right of Irish people to determine matters because this provision is open-ended.  For this reason alone, I have concerns about the wording.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_420">I oppose the amendment.  While I respect the bona fides of Deputy Catherine Murphy, essentially those who are opposed to the treaty will have an opportunity, once the Bill goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, to campaign and vote against the treaty.  However, the task of Members is to ensure the proposal to be put to the people is clear.  It is equally important for those who wish to vote for or against the proposal that it is clear and means something.  There is no point in the Oireachtas putting together a proposal that is uncertain or lacking in clarity.  Were a proposal to be put to the people that they simply ratify the treaty without having the additional provision for the avoidance or doubt, namely, that no provision of the Constitution operate to invalidate that to which they were agreeing, it would only be a half-proposal.  It is important that Members are clear about their role in this regard.  While they can debate the merits or otherwise of the treaty, they are agreeing to put a proposal to the people who will decide.  Their role is somewhat more limited, although they obviously can debate the treaty on its merits, as they did on Second Stage.  However, in this instance, their major task is to agree to what should be the proposal on which the people will decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I argue, with respect, that it would be irresponsible to put to the people a proposal that lacked clarity and left open to doubt the question of whether, were they to vote "Yes", it would have the intended impact, that is, that the treaty would be ratified and that no other provision of the Constitution could be invoked to invalidate it.  Almost the exact wording of this provision already is contained in Article 29.4.10° of the Constitution.  I believe Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to it, although I did not hear the beginning of her contribution.  The provisions of Article 29.4 10° state, "No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union or of the Communities," etc.  The Deputy is correct to state this is not a European Union treaty, for reasons of which Members are aware.  Nevertheless, it is an international agreement and still a treaty.  If the people are to agree to it and vote "Yes", the Oireachtas must bestow on it the same solidity as that has given to other measures.  I completely respect the bona fides of the Deputy, but in truth, this is a statement of opposition to the treaty masquerading as an attempt to modify it a little to make it less offensive in some way.  It is not offensive to tell the people that the Oireachtas proposes to include this provision in the Constitution.  Nor is it offensive for Members to further propose there be no doubt left open in anyone's minds but that were this measure to be inserted into the Constitution, it would stand and have the force of constitutional law.  That is what the Government seeks to achieve in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I also am familiar with the writings of Mr. Habermas who has written much apart from the statement read out by the Deputy.  To the extent that people are legitimately concerned that the European Union has been overly bureaucratised and centralised and that there is a democratic deficit, I made the point last night on Second Stage that this must be addressed through political work.  This means people must engage with the problems in Europe and others in Europe.  In this context, I note the Acting Chairman, Deputy Peter Mathews, and I have done this ourselves on one occasion.  People must take the opportunities through their political parties, the political families in Europe in which they are involved and so on to engage in and carry out political work.  I also make this point, with respect, to Sinn Féin Members.  There is no point in walking away from these issues by throwing one's hands in the air and stating it is all about bureaucrats or people coming to get us or seeking to threaten us and so on.  This is political work from which Members should not walk away.</p>

Whatever one might have thought about other treaties passed within the European Union - quite a number of Members have opposed many aspects of those treaties and campaigned against them - there is at least a countervailing democratic mechanism.  There are avenues through which the citizens of this country, even if sovereignty has been pooled at a European-wide level, can challenge the implementation of those policies.  However, this intergovernmental treaty is different because there is no democratic countervailing avenue.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">I have read it several times and moreover, I have it to hand.  The cheap shots should be avoided, as the Tánaiste and I simply have different takes on it.  There is no such mechanism and one should be clear that the paranoia, as the Government may perceive it, of Members on this side of the House has considerable evidence to back it up.  I refer to the comments of Chancellor Merkel at the end of the negotiations, when she stated "the debt brakes will be binding and valid forever.  Never will you be able to change them through a parliamentary majority."  It could not be clearer.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The treaty will do away with democracy in the context of fiscal and economic policy.  I would have thought that it will continue the process of eroding democracy.  At least with previous treaties - including Lisbon - we still had open to us, through the framework of the European Union, avenues to challenge that erosion.  This is not the case with the fiscal treaty.  Consequently, the heavyweight wording to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred is cause for a good deal of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I accept that we may disagree on what might be the implications of the treaty.  In the context of the correction mechanism, for example, the phrase "on the basis of common principles to be proposed by the European Commission, concerning in particular the nature, size and time-frame of the corrective action to be undertaken" is included in the treaty.  These are very significant powers and if the correction mechanism is triggered, the Commission will be able to dictate the nature, size and timeframe of cutbacks, structural reforms to the economy or whatever.  What will happen if these conflict with imperatives within the Constitution?  I refer, for example, to imperatives which declare that the natural resources of the State must remain the property of the people.  What will happen if the Commission decides that one of the structural reforms required in this country will be the privatisation of our national resources?  Under the treaties pertaining to the European Union, there would at least be mechanisms through which we could politically challenge such a decision.  However, what is before us is an intergovernmental treaty which simply relates to imposing fiscal rules and giving powers to the Commission to dictate courses of action in certain circumstances.  There is no democratic mechanism within the treaty which would allow us to challenge any decisions that might affect us.  The key point is that the will of the Commission will just be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">As Deputy Catherine Murphy stated, we are against the treaty.  In so far as the treaty's ratification is concerned, however, we are of the view that if it conflicts with imperatives in the Constitution, then we should have the ability to challenge its implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_103" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_433">Deputy Boyd Barrett's final point is clearly incorrect.  In the context of the automatic correction mechanism, the Commission is not being given a role whereby it can effectively dictate policy.  What will happen will be that it will propose the common principles to which the states party to the treaty will be obliged to agree.  These mechanisms are defined in a way whereby they will be agreed between the states and the Commission.  I just wanted to clarify the position in this regard in the event that any doubts may have arisen.  The question of the Commission telling us what we should do with natural resources, etc., is something of a red herring in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for tabling her amendment because it has challenged the House to address the content of the Bill.  At a level of principle, when Ireland ratifies a treaty it must honour it.  As a country, we have a very proud record of honouring our international obligations and long may this continue.  It would be quite invidious to pass a constitutional amendment which, in effect, would state that we would ratify the treaty but which would also indicate that we were not making provision to honour it.  That would be quite a dishonest approach for us to take in the conduct of international relations.  I appreciate the distinction to which Deputy Catherine Murphy drew attention earlier, namely, that under the Amsterdam and Nice treaties there was not an express provision in this regard.  However, the latter was because those treaties amended an existing treaty rather than being stand-alone mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The argument to the effect that the treaty does not make provision for democratic accountability is simply not true.  Article 12, for example, makes provision for a range of approaches to democratic accountability.  The governance arrangements have probably not received a great deal of attention in the debate that has taken place in respect of the treaty to date.  The treaty does not merely restate the rules relating to the euro, it also contains provisions in respect of the governance of the euro area.  These provide, for example, for meetings of Heads of State and Government at summit level in order to discuss issues relating to the euro.  Article 12 also makes provision for the involvement of the European Parliament.  The treaty contains a clear democratic accountability provision under this article.  In addition, Article 13 provides for the committees of national parliaments - in our case this will be the Joint Committees on European Union Affairs and Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform - to play a role in respect of the governance of the euro area and also in discussions on budgetary policy and other issues covered by the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Although this aspect has probably not received a great deal of attention to date, I would summarise by stating that the treaty actually strengthens the democratic involvement of national governments because Heads of State and Government will meet at summit level to discuss issues relating to the euro.  It also makes provision for the involvement of the European Parliament and crucially - this will be of interest to the Members of this House - the committees of national parliaments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_437">The one thing which became clear during the entire process of negotiations which led to the drafting of this treaty is that Heads of State and Government are not equal.  Deputy White stated that we can work through the political families.  It must be recognised that Ireland is a minnow in respect of this matter and it is not in a position of equality with other states.  The European Union was built on solidarity and a level of equality and the veto was part of the protections for small countries.  We do not have a Europe of the equals.  I recall the Tánaiste stating some years ago that there is a world of difference between influence and power.  The powers of the European Parliament are not going to be enhanced under the treaty.  It may well be that it will be able to exert some influence but there is a difference between the power and influence.  I do not need to explain the nature of that difference to the Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">We are being asked to make provision for the treaty at constitutional level because that is the level at which Angela Merkel wants the matter to be determined.  This will mean that the treaty cannot be watered down and that its provisions will be copperfastened.  As previous speakers indicated, this means that it will be there for evermore.  Essentially, the Government did not jump and down in seeking to have the treaty incorporated within the Constitution.  On the day on which the announcement to the effect that a referendum would be required was made, the body language on the Government side appeared to indicate that the latter was not what was desired.  I am sure, however, the Tánaiste will state that this was not the case.  It does not seem to have been desirable.  We are moving towards a position where there will be a conflict with the rights of the citizens of this State and democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I will respond to the Tánaiste's point about the democratic component, as he is being somewhat disingenuous in his reference to the role of the European Parliament.  Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states: "The President of the European Parliament may be invited to be heard".  The phrase is "may" rather than "will be".  That is the extent of the involvement of the democratic part of the European Union, which we all know does not have much democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">Yes, it is an account of what is being done.  We can like it or lump it.  National parliaments are talking shops in my interpretation of Article 13, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_444">As foreseen in Title II of Protocol (No 1) on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the European Union Treaties, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments of the Contracting Parties will together determine the organisation and promotion of a conference of representatives of the relevant committees of the national Parliaments and representatives of the relevant committees of the European Parliament in order to discuss budgetary policies and other issues covered by this Treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">There are no other powers so they are a talking shop.  They will meet to discuss the issue.  It is a democratic fig-leaf.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">This is about being dictated to by the big states with a simple majority.  That is what we are signing up to and there is no countervailing democratic mechanism, as we noted.  Consequently, Deputy Murphy's amendment is on the mark.  She is considering the implications of unintended consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">We will debate over the coming weeks the potential consequences of the treaty.  If the Government gets its way the treaty will be ratified and we will discover those implications but what if the consequences are different to what those on the "Yes" side imagine?  What if they are more far-reaching and lead to a position where the Commission will dictate matters and demand certain types of structural reform in our economy, including issues that may impinge on imperatives within the Constitution?  What if the Government is wrong and where is the democratic avenue for us to deal with the unintended consequences that may arise?  With this wording, there is none because all provisions of the Constitution are overridden in ratifying the treaty.  This is against a more simple process where we can ratify the treaty but if we later find it conflicts with the Constitution, there is some recourse for challenge.  That is the point of Deputy Murphy's amendment, which is right in its approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_448">Giving my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, the benefit of the doubt a few minutes ago with the question of whether he was "paranoid", to use his own word, I am nevertheless coming quickly to the conclusion that he is paranoid.  He has constantly used variations of the word "dictate" in arguing the Commission is "dictating" matters.  That has never been the pattern of our experience in the European Union.  In every referendum debate for as long as I remember, it was always argued that because we were a small country, we would be overruled, lose out, pushed aside and our voice would not be heard.  When has that occurred?  I ask the colleagues opposite or anybody else to help me with an example of any time in the past 40 years when Ireland's interests, argued and articulated by the Government and representatives in Europe, were defeated, excluded and overridden.  When did this happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The only way such a question can be met is with silence because it has never occurred.  The constant playing with words like "dictate" in reference to the Commission is wrong.  It may interest Deputy Boyd Barrett and others to know that the people in the Commission are people not all that different from him and me.  Generally speaking, they are reasonably intelligent and well informed.  We can either agree or disagree with them.  The notion that we will be the victims of some pattern of interest being overridden by these people is infantile.  I am not saying everything will be plain sailing and that everything that an Irish Minister or representative argues in Brussels will necessarily win through.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">This is a process and not a question of being dictated to.  People should grow up and understand how these processes come about.  It would be great to have some of the people involved in this argument getting stuck into some of these discussions and gaining experience in fighting for Ireland's interests rather than constantly arguing that the Europeans will dictate to us and do us down.  It can be frustrating to hear such arguments and it is misleading the people, as they do not tally with past experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The Tánaiste can correct me but my understanding is that if the people pass the referendum, they will have agreed to put existing rules into the domestic law of the State.  Deputy Murphy argued that the rules would be inserted into the Constitution at the insistence of Chancellor Merkel but that is wrong.  I do not know any more about the debate which took place other than what I read in the newspapers but as I understand it there was an argument that the debt brake and deficit rules should be put into the constitutions of the various countries.  That was not agreed in the end and instead there was a consensus that the rules would "take effect in the national law of the Contracting Parties at the latest one year after the entry into force of this Treaty through provisions of binding force and permanent character, preferably constitutional, or otherwise guaranteed to be fully respected and adhered to throughout the national budgetary processes".  I understand that to be a compromise and that form of words was reached in circumstances where people were not willing to put the details of a debt brake and deficit rules into the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I would have objected to such a process of involving deficit rules and debt brakes into our Constitution as they do not belong there.  They will not be inserted into it.  If the people vote "Yes" in this referendum, there will be a permissive provision inserted into the Constitution allowing the Oireachtas to introduce legislation to domestic law.  That can be debated in this House and passed or otherwise by the democratically elected Members of these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">With all the talk of being dictated to and excluding parliaments, we should consider paragraph 2 of Article 3, which is arguably the most important article in the treaty.  It refers to how the rules would have to take effect in national law.  There is reference to the contracting parties putting in place at national level a correction mechanism.  The final paragraph states that such correction mechanisms "shall fully respect the prerogatives of national parliaments".  This sentence is ignored because it does not suit Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Catherine Murphy.  Selective quotation of the treaty is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">On the role of the European Commission, the document is replete with references to matters such as country specific measures being agreed by the Commission and refers to a timeframe being agreed with countries.  This is not a process of dictation.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_607">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_608">When one enters the wonderful new museum and genealogy centre at Glasnevin Cemetery, one is greeted with a quote of Leopard Bloom from James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_609">How many!  All these here once walked round Dublin.  Faithful departed.  As you are now so once were we.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Incredibly more than 1.1 million Dubliners and non-Dubliners have been buried in the historic Glasnevin Cemetery since it opened in 1832 under the direction of the great Daniel O'Connell.  The 124 acres of Glasnevin Cemetery embody the social and political history of our capital city over the past 180 years.  The graveyard has also been the site of a number of iconic funerals that, in effect, helped to change the course of Irish history.  However, it is not just Glasnevin Cemetery and other great city graveyards such as Dublin's Mount Jerome or St. Finbarr's in Cork city that are of major importance.  Thousands of parish and local authority graveyards in villages and towns up and down the country are the repository of vital local history and stand as unique memorials to our past.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Clearly, how the dead are buried and commemorated has always been an integral part of our culture and heritage from Newgrange stretching right up to the present day with a growing number of Irish people opting to have their loved ones cremated.  On average, nearly 29,000 people die in the Republic each year and the disposal of human remains, whether through burial or cremation, must be carried out to the highest standards and with the strictest regulations in place to oversee the process.  For this reason I greatly welcome the selection of this Private Members' Bill, the Burial and Cremation Regulation Bill 2011, for debate in the House today, as it attempts to address some important gaps in the regulation of cemeteries and crematoria.  Comprehensive primary legislation would be the most effective way of addressing the lack of statutory safeguards in this complex and very sensitive area.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">This Bill originated in a number of grossly inappropriate planning applications for private crematoria and cemeteries that were submitted in my own and other constituencies.   I was inspired to prepare the Bill by the work of my Labour Party colleague and eminent Fingal county councillor, Peter Coyle.  Last year, for example, Councillor Coyle and myself welcomed Fingal County Council's refusal of permission for a new private burial ground and crematorium beside St. Doolagh's Nursing Home in Balgriffin, Dublin 13.  This proposal, in particular, also brought to light the astonishing lack of a legislative and regulatory framework for the development and operation of crematoria across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, acknowledged this in a reply to a parliamentary question to myself last July when he said that there "are no specific regulations governing crematoria in Ireland" apart from the general planning process.  Section 47 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts 1878 to 2001 allows the Minister to "make regulations in relation to the disposal of human remains other than by burial".   It has been suggested by existing crematoria operators, including the Glasnevin Trust, that an interim measure could be for the Minister to introduce regulations for cremation under this Act.  At this stage I would like to pay a warm tribute to Mr. George McCullough and Mr. Mervyn Colville of the Glasnevin Trust, who briefed me, and all of their staff given their outstanding work in overseeing five major cemeteries - Dardistown, Glasnevin, Goldenbridge, Newlands Cross and Palmerstown - as well as two crematoria at Glasnevin and Newlands Cross.  The Glasnevin Trust is governed by the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, a voluntary not-for-profit organisation that was first established in 1828 and re-established under the Dublin Cemeteries Committee Acts of 1846 and 1970.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Existing crematoria operators such as the Glasnevin Trust follow UK legislation and best practice.  However, this is done on a voluntary basis and there is no onus on any potential new crematorium operator to follow this example.  I wish to stress at this stage that the existing crematoria in Ireland are highly reputable operations and families who have opted for cremation have reported the very high standards that they have experienced throughout the whole process.  However, given the growing importance of cremation in Ireland and the number of planning applications for new privately-run crematoria, it is important that we update the legislation and ensure that all future crematoria are operated and maintained to the highest standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">In 2006, just more than 8% of people who died in Ireland were cremated.  It is now estimated that between 10% to 12% of people who die in Ireland are cremated.  That is a low figure compared to many other states.  For example, in the same year in Denmark the cremation rate was 74%, while in the UK the rate was 72%.  In New Zealand the rate was 66%, while it was 40% in Germany, 34% in the USA and 21% in Spain.  Incredibly, the Japanese cremation rate is more than 99%.  Given trends across the world, it is likely that cremation rates will increase in Ireland.  Dublin has a higher rate of cremation at 15% than the national average, which is clearly mainly because the option of cremation is available here.  Three out of four Irish crematoriums are located in Dublin with the fourth in Cork.  I understand that the first non-city based crematorium is set to open in Cavan by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The first general UK cremation legislation, including cremation certification, was introduced in 1902 and it is notable that Ireland was specifically excluded under section 16 of that Act.  In the aftermath of the uncovering of the horrific crimes of Dr. Harold Shipman in the UK, there were a number of important reviews there of the cremation certification process including the Shipman Inquiry, the Fundamental Review and the Scottish Review.   The so-called Fundamental Review of 2003 found that "the death certification and coroner services were not ‘fit for purpose' in modern society".  A number of critical recommendations for the reform and modernisation of the UK death certification process were made in these reviews, some of which were implemented under the subsequent Cremation (England and Wales) Regulations 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I understand that the cremation certification process in Ireland is strict.  For example, before a cremation can take place the medical referee must sign the relevant forms and be fully satisfied that the attending doctor viewed the body before and after the death, and completed the medical certificate and the form stating that there is no reason the body should not be cremated.  This attending doctor is also required to assess whether the coroner should be notified of the death.  In addition, if the cause of death is initially unclear, it would be difficult to get an immediate cremation without a coroner's cremation certificate.  In extreme cases, a Garda superintendent has the power to stop a cremation.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">A strict cremation certification process is clearly critically important given that with a burial the body can be exhumed if any suspicion of foul play arises.  Irish crematoria operators have also informed me that they believe that a case such as the Shipman case would be very quickly flagged in this jurisdiction.  However, a number of stakeholders have also suggested that the Irish cremation certification process could be looked at either through a comprehensive cremation Bill or an expanded version of the long-awaited new coroners Bill.  Such a review would encompass many complicated and sensitive issues and is beyond the scope of this Private Members' Bill, which concentrates on the regulation of the establishment, operation and maintenance of crematoria.  Part 5 of the Bill, however, stipulates that no cremation may take place in Ireland apart from in a licensed and approved crematorium and after the application for cremation has been approved by all relevant authorities.  I urge the Minister to urgently address this matter in primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">At present it is possible for anybody to simply open a crematorium once they have applied for general planning permission for their premises.  Contrast this with the process in place for running an off-licence or applying for a taxi licence where in the case of an off-licence the applicant needs planning permission for their premises as well as a three-part full off-licence to be able to run their establishment.  If a licence is needed to sell alcohol or to operate a taxi business, why is it not necessary for the operation of such a sensitive business as a crematorium?</p>
          <p eId="para_620">In addition, it is not clear whether local authorities and An Bord Pleanála have the expertise to invigilate crematoria proposals given the lack of regulations that are in place for their operation and maintenance standards.  What guidelines are local authorities and An Bord Pleanála operating to when they assess an application for a new crematorium?  One of the observations at the time of a recently refused application for a private crematorium was that the proposed cemetery site was so small that it would be in effect a funeral home with a crematorium attached.  Such a system is widespread across the United States.  Given the incredibly sensitive nature of this process, it is critical that clear standards are laid down now to regulate the establishment, operation and maintenance of all crematoria in Ireland to best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">That is why the core part of the Bill before us provides for the establishment of a self-financing burial and cremation regulatory authority in Parts 2 to 6.  One of the authority's key functions, as laid out in section 3, would be to approve the building and operation of all crematoria and to licence the practice of cremation in the State.  This would be based on a plan presented by the relevant Minister on a ten-yearly basis setting out the core principles of the death disposal process in the State, including the planning, building and maintenance of crematoria.  My colleague, Councillor Peter Coyle, has also called for Fingal County Council to prepare a detailed report and policy document on the care and management of cemeteries in Fingal.  This could be replicated at national level for both crematoria and cemeteries in the ten-yearly strategy plan.  Some counties, particularly Sligo, have drawn up such a plan for their cemeteries.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Section 4 clearly sets out that any persons or company wishing to open or close a crematorium must give notice to the authority and must ensure that strict maintenance standards are adhered to.  Section 4(4) also allows that every crematorium operator must make its crematorium open for inspection at any reasonable time by any person appointed for that purpose by the burial and cremation regulatory authority.  Section 4(3) stipulates that any crematorium operator must ensure that the columbarium wall, or memorial wall, at the crematorium or in a cemetery is well maintained and kept in a clean and orderly condition.  I have received numerous complaints about the maintenance of memorial walls in a number of cemeteries.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The absence of clear legislative provisions is also highlighted by the national council on the Forum on End of Life in the context of the environmental sustainability of the cremation process given the problem of mercury emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The national council of the Forum on End of Life is an initiative of the Irish Hospice Foundation that began in 2009 to engage with the public on end-of-life issues in terms of dying, bereavement and the disposal of human remains.  The forum is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and involves stakeholders, including the CEO of the Irish Hospice Association, the Irish Association of Funeral Directors, the Dublin City Coroner, senior medical experts involved in palliative care, the former CEO of the National Council for the Aged, the National Council for the Elderly and the National Council on Ageing and Older People.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Burial grounds are subject to legislative provisions, including under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts 1878 to 2001 and the Local Government Act 1994.  However, there is still a significant gap in legislation dealing with privately built and managed burial grounds, including new "green" cemeteries.  The long-term financing model for private graveyards and crematoriums is a profound issue that has not been addressed in any meaningful way.  In 30 or 40 years time will it yet again fall to the public authorities which run existing great historic cemeteries or local authorities to provide sustainable long-term financing and care for privately established cemeteries and crematoriums?  As my colleague, Councillor Peter Coyle, stated in his formal objection to the St. Doolagh proposal:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_626">While cemeteries can generate a lot of profit, the revenue tends to be front-loaded.  As the cemetery fills up, the source of income disappears.  The question of maintenance then becomes a major issue for the speculator.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Will it then become the case that privately run graveyards will be able to charge exorbitant prices for access to burial plots?  The cost of burial plots has already been raised a number of times by my colleagues, Deputies Robert Dowds and Eamon Maloney.  If a private cemetery operator goes bust, will the local authority or the State be left with ongoing horrendous operating and maintenance costs for burial grounds?  Just as it is the case with crematoriums, it is not clear that local authority planning departments or An Bord Pleanála are in a position to invigilate a cemetery proposal which necessarily involves the long-term sustainable management and financing of memorials and graves.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">In the course of preparation of the Bill I received an excellent brief from two members of the national council of the Forum on End of Life, the former CEO of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors, Mr. Gus Nicholls, and Mr. Mervyn Taylor and also from Ms. Sarah Murphy of the Irish Hospice Foundation.  The national council of Forum on End of Life  produced an excellent document in April 2011 entitled, The Funeral Industry in Ireland: The case for reform and regulation.  The report states, for example, that "there are major problems in Ireland with regard to sub-standard funeral care.  There are currently no barriers to entry and no licensing in an industry responsible for the burial or cremation of up to 30,000 people a year".  It also notes that out of around 600 funeral service providers across the country, just about 250 are members of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors which lays down strict guidelines for its members.  Less than 100 of the 600 providers are full-time operators.  Sadly, the report also highlights the "significant particular lack of regulations and standards in the area of embalming, often carried out by untrained personnel in inadequate hospital premises".  It sets out the legal framework in place in other states to regulate their funeral industries.  In the Canadian state of Ontario, for example, there is a Funeral Directors and Establishments Act which established a board of funeral services to oversee the licensing and regulation of the sector.  In the United States there is the Federal Trade Commission's funeral rule to ensure transparency in the provision of goods and services from a funeral service provider.  In Australia the Public Health (Disposal of Bodies) Act 2002 lays out strict guidelines for the sector.  In Britain there is consumer protection in the case of funeral services and contracts under sections 59 and 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The national council of the Forum on End of Life has proposed a valuable reform programme for the funeral industry, including an official certification and licensing process for all funeral service providers; a self-financing regulatory framework for all funeral service providers; mandatory training for all funeral service providers and embalmers; official oversight and inspection of funeral homes and embalming facilities; and enhanced transparency with written estimates for and itemisation of funeral costs and bills.  Clearly, the administration of these requirements could form a key function of the burial and cremation regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Given the horrific current economic circumstances, I understand some colleagues may be wary about the establishment of a burial and cremation regulatory authority under Part 2 of the Bill.  Clearly, there were many unnecessary and costly quangos established during the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats-Green Party era as various Ministers attempted to outsource their key responsibilities to unaccountable bodies.  In this case, however, the industry is highlighting the lack of regulation and licensing in the sector and the need for urgent Government action.  The burial and cremation regulation authority would be a self-financing body as outlined in section 2(2) of the Bill through the levying of a small charge on operators in the sector.  The national council of the Forum on End of Life has proposed that a new self-financing Irish model could see funeral service providers paying a levy of €25 per funeral which it estimates would generate an annual income of €722,450 based on 28,898 deaths per year.  In this context, the forum has warned about the possibility that part or all of this charge would be passed on to the public, an issue which it believes must be addressed in legislation before any new levy would be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">It is estimated that, on average, a funeral in Ireland costs approximately €4,500, rising, on average, to €5,000 in the greater Dublin area.  It must again be noted in this context that the cost of graves has been raised on numerous occasions by colleagues in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">In the Bill I have proposed the establishment of a stand-alone regulatory body, the burial and cremation regulatory authorityl.  However, in its report the Forum on End of Life highlights a number of other methods through which a regulatory agency for the funeral sector could be established.  Its proposals include the establishment of an office within the HSE for the regulation of funeral services, the expansion of the role of the Health Information and Quality Authority to include funeral services or the establishment of an office within the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The Minister could take any of these routes or he could simply accept the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity on behalf of the many people who work in this sector and all of our constituents to raise this subject which I ask the Minister to place on the clár for future Government action.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_634">Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  Gabhaim leithscéal an Tí ar an chéad dul síos ar son mo chomhghleacaí an Teachta Niall Collins.  Theastaigh uaidh bheith anseo chun déileáil leis an reachtaíocht seo ach leagadh as an Teach é.  I commend Deputy Broughan for bringing this important matter before the House.  As we move towards the start of the weekend,it could be said that we are taking the graveyard slot of the week's business, but that does not take away from the importance of the issues before us.  Clearly, Deputy Broughan has committed significant time and thought to the issue.  It is a particularly pressing issue in the greater Dublin area, but it will inevitably affect us in rural Ireland in due course.  This is an issue that affects all of us, even more than taxes.  It is an opportunity to reflect on the broader issues involved.  While we are sceptical about aspects of the Bill, we welcome the chance to thrash out what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Reflecting on the subject matter I am reminded of the great parliamentarian Edmund Burke's view of the State as being founded on the profound link between the "dead, the living and the unborn" and our obligation to ensure the departed generations who once shared this island are respectfully treated.  Graveyards are clear symbols and reminders of our past.  They bear testament to the lives of the people who shaped the areas around them and bequeathed to us the country in which we live.  Memorials to past generations, family members and friends are a repository of the history of a local area.  Deputy Broughan has given as an example Glasnevin Cemetery in which are to be found the graves of national heroes who defined the country.  The republican plot holding the men and women who defined the fight for freedom, the round tower-peaked tomb of the Liberator, Daniel O'Connell, and the grave of the great Charles Stewart Parnell who established political party politics as we know it today are resting places that attract visitors and commemorations.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">On a human level, graveyards are the place of repose of loved ones and family members.  They are the final resting places of those who may not fill the pages of history books but who make up the life of the country.  How we treat the dead is a major part of our heritage and culture and reflects on our values.  It is in this light that I welcome the chance to discuss the Bill and the wider issues around burial and cremation.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">There are several issues I would like to discuss relating to the Bill, as well as the broader implications for burials and cremations across the country, including the cost of burials, the adequate regulation of current burial and cremation practices, as well as future developments in human disposal, the role of local authorites in regulation, the proposal in the Bill for a new regulator and the need for Government legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The financial implications of funerals are often overlooked amidst the inevitable grieving that comes with a loved one passing away yet, it it a serious cost.  The average price of €4,500 or €5,000 per funeral is a serious amount of money, particularly for those on low incomes.  With 30,000 people passing away each year in Ireland, it means €135 million is spent on funerals every year.  Access to plots is a growing concern for people.  In County Kildare the sharp cost is clear - a plot will cost approximately €1,100 with an additional administrative fee of €120.  One also cannot purchase a plot before the death occurs so there can be no advance purchase for family accommodation.  There is a significant divergence of cost across the country in this regard.  For example, in comparison to Kildare, in County Offaly a plot can cost €400.  Funeral directors are reacting to the rising costs by avoiding securing the plot for the departed and leaving that issue to families to resolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Securing additional lands for graveyards is a growing concern for local authorities.  We have seen the massive growth in population over the past 20 years throughout the country, but while the houses were being built little was being done by local authorities to provide for the long-term needs of people who wished to repose eventually in the communities in which they lived.  Little was done by local authorities to ensure adequate graveyard space was provided.  Kildare County Council is engaged in ongoing negotiations with landowners to expand its graveyard facilities as current grounds reach capacity.  The opportunity to be buried locally, near their homes and beside their families and friends, should be available to all people.  Tackling the rising costs of funerals and ensuring that adequate and appropriate grounds are available for burials must be the key goal in any legislation regarding burials and cremation.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Deputy Broughan raises the issue of privately run cemeteries and crematoria and the long-term financial sustainability of such operations.  The prospect of a private operator going bust and leaving the graveyard in desolation is an appalling one.  Clearly safeguards must be in place to ensure that the long-term future maintenance of such graveyards is assured.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">These concerns lead me onto the crux of the Bill, a proposal for a new authority to supervise the industry.  Deputy Broughan has put forward a plan for a new authority, the burial and cremation regulatory authority.  This has been advocated by the national council of the Forum on End of Life in Ireland.  While there is a clear need to provide effective regulation of the area, I am wary of this idea as a solution to the problem for two main reasons.  The first is the potential cost to the taxpayer of the new body or quango being established and the second is the repercussions it has for the role of local government.  We are living through a period in which the local authorities are to be divested of their responsibilities for the provision of water and sanitary services and now it is suggested that they be deprived of their role in the area of burial and graveyard maintenance.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">People are justifiably sceptical about the establishment of an additional quango.  The self-financing model from Ontario Canada that is advocated, with €25 per funeral going to the authority, might not work and I fear the additional costs will ultimately be borne by the consumer and lead to more expensive funerals, rather than lowering the price as should be the aim of regulation.  Will holes in the financial model be plugged by the ever embattled Exchequer and ultimately the Irish taxpayer?  We have an obligation to explore other less potentially costly methods to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Local authorities, as the local operators with real local knowledge, have the potential to expand their role in this area.  As Deputy Broughan has detailed, they need a clear, strong regulatory framework to adequately supervise the evolving industry locally.  The stripping from local authorities of what powers they have through the murky creation of Irish Water and leaks about the abolition of town councils do not bode well for the future White Paper on local government reform.  It indicates a haphazard approach by the Government to local government.  Reducing the role of local authorities through this Bill would further compound the ongoing failure to take a holistic approach to local government reform.  The piecemeal approach in whittling away powers will exacerbate the problems we have experienced with a system that is not fit for purpose in modern Ireland.  It would be premature to create a new body to supplant the role of local authorities in the area before we have conducted a root and branch review of the future shape of local government and what powers local authorities should have.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The evolving nature of how people deal with the end of life in Ireland presents a series of challenges for regulation.  The rise of cremations as an increasingly popular choice looks likely to continue over the coming years.  Ireland has a comparatively low rate of cremation but trends suggest that this will continue to rise steadily, demanding regulation in the area as new crematoria are established.  There are just four crematoria in the country and one suspects there is a growing demand for such facilities to be available in regional locations.  The current four crematoria operating in the State have a strong reputation that we should acknowledge, but that should not stop us from providing for the future.  New methods of disposal are being developed across the globe, such as promession.  This is the dipping of the corpse in liquid nitrogen.  Technology in the area is rapidly advancing beyond what we previously anticipated and will continue to do so into the future in ways we cannot even imagine at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">As part of revamping the role of local authorities we should ensure they have a clear regulatory framework to supervise these new and old industries adequately.  An interim cremation regulation under the Local Government Act is one such method to deal with the uncovered area of cremation.  The Deputy's Bill correctly highlights the role of the deeply important Columbarium Wall as a specific area to be protected.  Regulations covering standards in funeral care, ensuring that trained personnel provide an adequate, respectful service should be set out.  Specific guidelines for local authorities to decide upon graveyard and crematorium planning applications are also required.  These guidelines should be integrated into the county development plan in setting out the spatial future of burials, crematoria and other end of life issues in the county.  The guidelines should integrate environmental concerns, spatial impact, the social role of end of life facilities and potential cost implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Deputy Broughan's call on the Government to begin a comprehensive review of this area is welcome, and we support it.  This review should not take place in a vacuum but as a broader part of examining the role of local government.  The review should place at its heart the need to ensure that people's right to a humane final repose is maintained.  The National Forum on End of Life in Ireland sets out a number of interesting ideas that are worth exploring as part of the comprehensive review.  Its proposals for reform cover official certification, model for regulation, official oversight and inspection of funeral homes, embalming training to be mandatory for embalmers and embalming facilities to be regularly inspected as well as full transparency on costs involved in setting out a funeral.  These ideas along with those of other stakeholders should form the core of a review and future legislation in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">In conclusion, I again thank Deputy Broughan for producing the Bill and reflecting upon the challenges facing a neglected area.  I am glad we have had the opportunity to discuss these matters in the House today.  While I disagree with the creation of a new authority, Deputy Broughan's Bill raises important matters that should be dealt with comprehensively by the Government.  The evolution of how people wish to go to their final resting place, the rising demand for burial plots and the cost of funerals set the immediate agenda for reform.  On a more fundamental level, there is a bigger issue.  Deputy Broughan started with a quote by Joyce, so I will try to keep up the high level literary tone.  Just as Joyce's image of the snow falling "upon all the living and the dead" reminds us of the flow of life, we have an obligation to ensure that the dead are respected and looked after in their final rest.  I look forward to a meaningful Government response to the concerns and suggestions outlined here today.  I commend Deputy Broughan on his initiative.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
          <p eId="para_648">I compliment Deputy Broughan on bringing this Bill forward.  It is alarming that there is no legislation to regulate the establishment of crematoria in the State.  Sinn Féin agrees with Deputy Broughan that there is a need for regulation to ensure cremations are carried out in a proper and dignified manner.  Respecting the bereaved, the family and the local community is key to this.  Expecting those who carry out cremations voluntarily to follow the British code, as is happening at present, is naïve and unsatisfactory.  While I understand the need for regulation and standards, the Bill is overly prescriptive.  Currently, it is the role of a local authority to oversee and maintain public cemeteries.  The establishment of yet another ministerial appointed quango, the burial and cremation regulatory authority, as outlined in the Bill, is not productive.  Local authorities, with democratically elected members, provide some level of accountability.  Quangos do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The requirement for the authority to be self-financing will raise alarm bells.  This requirement may make the process of burial and cremation more expensive than it already is.  Burial and cremation is hugely expensive at present.  I have heard figures as high as €7,000 quoted, particularly in the city of Dublin.  Will the public have to pay to fund another quango on top of that?  I understand the need for regulation but it should come under the local authority and, in turn, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Its application, regulation and oversight should be left to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">There has been mention of private cemeteries.  It is timely that Deputy Broughan has raised this matter.  The Bill highlights problems that could affect people in, perhaps, 50 years time.  Huge problems could be caused if a company that owned a private cemetery went bankrupt, for example.  We need regulation to cover that eventuality.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">If local authorities need more legislation to assist them in their duties, that is a discussion we must have.  Local authorities already have wide ranging powers to regulate cemeteries.  They can pass by-laws, for example.  Some years ago, I was involved in introducing by-laws for cemeteries in County Laois.  Many of these by-laws are being used in a positive manner by councils.  In simply practical terms, local authorities are best placed to implement any set of agreed guidelines.  The establishment of a national body to oversee burials and cremations would further undermine  the positive role of councils and restrict flexibility and co-operation between local authorities in managing graveyards.  I am referring to the joint burial boards that exist on the boundaries of local authorities where a number of councils might come together to form a joint burial board.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Bill also calls for the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to acquire, hold and dispose of land for graveyards or crematoria.  This is the job of local councils.  Local authorities already make those decisions based on need and demographics in their own local areas.  If more land is required local authorities can acquire it.  Many local authorities are facing tightening budgets but this merely underlines the need for adequate funding of our local government system.  Creating another authority on top of that system will not solve the problem.  The Government will have to deal with this funding issue as part of reform of local government.  I look forward to that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The upkeep of disused graveyards must be addressed, particularly those of older communities and minority faiths.  Huguenot and Quaker graveyards come to mind.  Here in Dublin and in my own constituency of Laois-Offaly some of these graveyards have fallen into disrepair and been vandalised.  It is important that these burial grounds be maintained with dignity and when they become disused that any development in or around them be done in a sensitive manner.  The Huguenot graveyard in Merrion Row, not ten minutes from here, is a good example of how a cemetery of historical note can be beautifully maintained, but another Huguenot graveyard has had its gravestones covered in graffiti and tumbled over to make way for development.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">While the Bill attempts to deal with this issue it states that the burial and cremation regulatory authority will have national responsibility for the long-term maintenance of all cemeteries.  This is a huge legal and practical challenge because there are thousands of graveyards throughout the State, owned by councils, burial boards, churches, local committees, trusts and so on.  It is not practical simply to stitch into the Bill a requirement that the body would be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all of those.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Sinn Féin fully supports the need for regulation of graveyards and crematoria, particularly the new emerging private graveyards which will pose challenges in the future.  However, to think the issue will be resolved by a seven person ministerial appointed authority is naïve and impractical.  I urge Deputy Broughan to rethink the Bill and change its emphasis.  The Bill should allow for more powers to be devolved to local authorities.  A previous speaker referred to powers being taken from local councils.  At present, the upkeep of cemeteries comes under water services in most of the local authorities I deal with.  Here is an area where we can give local authorities extra powers to implement regulations.  I would like to see national regulations established that can be used throughout the State, with local authorities having a role in ensuring they are enforced and that people are buried with dignity and burial places preserved and maintained.</p>

        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_656">Deputy Broughan does a considerable service in bringing forward this Bill.  Until I read the Bill and received other information, I was unaware there is no legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of crematoria and some graveyards.  It was a particular inappropriate planning application for a private burial ground and crematorium on the grounds of a nursing home in his own constituency that brought the lack of regulation to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I was surprised and appalled to see there are no barriers to entry and no licensing in an industry that is responsible for the burial and cremation of 30,000 people every year.  It seems as if anyone can set up in this business.  There is a mixture of full-time and part-time funeral operators in the country.  There seem to be no regulations or standards in the area of embalming, where there are often untrained personnel and inadequate premises.  Cremation, which has become more popular, is also not governed by specific laws or regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Crematoria are following UK legislation and best practice but there is no obligation on them to do that, so there is, obviously, a need for this legislation.  I believe the Bill is in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Funerals and the ceremonies associated with them are part of every society and in Irish society we have a great respect and understanding for people at these difficult times.  We also have great respect for burial grounds.  If one walks into any Irish graveyard during a weekend, coming up to Christmas or Easter or at anniversaries or particular occasions, one sees families and friends tending graves, planting shrubs or bringing flowers.  They are remembering their loved ones in death and honouring them in that way.  In my own experience, the graves of my relatives and friends in the Dublin area are well tended and looked after.  It causes great anguish and anxiety to people when graves are desecrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Regulation of crematoria is vital from an environmental point of view, owing to mercury emissions produced by dental amalgam in human remains.  In preparing for this debate, I learned that in many European countries emissions from crematoria are now a major source of mercury emissions.  Other ways to treat dental amalgam waste are covered by EU law but emissions from crematoria are not.  This is something else to be tackled.  There are also various newer approaches to dealing with human remains.  These could also be a subject for debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The Bill contains some technical details relating to the proposed burial and cremation regulatory authority.  The details on the roles, resignations and removal of members are straightforward.  However, I am concerned about the bugbear of expenses.  I agree that regulation is necessary and that an authority is necessary but I do not want to support legislation that could create another quango.  We have enough of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The national council of the Forum on End of Life in Ireland has a model of licensing for funeral directors involving payment of a levy by funeral directors into a central fund.   This self-financing model is similar to one in operation in Ontario, Canada, for the past 30 years.  The proposal is that the levy would be paid by funeral directors in exchange for official certification and licensing.  The levy would go into a fund which would finance the operation of an office which would regulate the funeral industry.  The industry must be regulated according to the number of funerals a funeral director organises.  Population is a major factor.  Some areas such as the greater Dublin area have many more funerals than take place in other parts of the country with smaller populations.  The difficulty is that the payment of the levy by funeral directors could result in an additional cost to individual funeral bills, which would not be desirable.  The suggestion is that the levy would be €25 per funeral.  Based on 30,000 deaths per year that would realise more than €700,000.  I hope if such a levy were to be introduced that it could be absorbed by funeral directors and not by bereaved families.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">It was said that the average cost of a funeral in Dublin is approximately €4,500.  From my experience of organising funerals it is considerably more, while it is slightly less outside the greater Dublin area.  Graves account for a considerable part of funeral expenses.  Standard plots in Dublin are between €1,500 and €5,000.  I cannot understand why it costs almost the same to open an existing grave as it does to open a new grave.  Some funeral directors in the Dublin Central area have been most supportive of families who have been unable to cover the cost of funerals.  I know of families in some communities that are struggling badly to cover the costs, in particular in the case of the deaths of young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We are somewhat spoiled in the area I represent - Dublin Central - because we have long-standing funeral directors who are all full time and who provide a professional service.  I refer to Stafford's, Kirwan's and Jennings'.  They have put resources into their funeral parlours although if anyone could use the word "nice" about a funeral parlour some of those fit the description.  They are quiet, dignified places that allow families privacy and dignity.  The way in which those undertakers have handled funeral arrangements at difficult times has been second to none.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Deputy Broughan addressed issues on the planning of new crematoria and graveyards.  I hope the proposed authority will follow proper planning procedures because we have enough examples of irregular planning in this country.  It is important that the rules and procedures relating to the maintenance and running of crematoria and graveyards are set down and followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">In the Dublin area, Glasnevin Cemetery does a phenomenal job of looking after the graves. The cemetery has a lot of historic graves, ones which are of great interest to everyone.  I am impressed with the museum that it has set up and the various walkways, which add something to the cemetery.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">In the context of burials, I have been involved in cilliní.  I acknowledge the work of archaeologist and anthropologist, Toni Maguire, who has been doing great work in this area.  She uncovered thousands of cilliní in the diocese of Down and Connor.  She is now working in Milltown Cemetery.  She stresses the social importance of preserving cilliní, which involve burials carried out in secret.  In some cases the babies were not baptised or some other issue arose in connection with the death.  The families tried to bury the children as close to consecrated ground as they could and that must be respected.  I wished to take the opportunity to make that point.  Perhaps the authority could take it on board and the walls associated with crematoria could accommodate a space for the cilliní.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Another group of people of whom I am aware from my involvement with them are the ladies who lived in the Magdalene Laundries.  They had no dignity in life and, unfortunately, in some cases they do not have any dignity in death.  Again, perhaps the proposed authority could play a role in ensuring there is a proper memorial to those ladies who are buried in various graveyards throughout the country and that we could get rid of the word "penitents" in the graveyard in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">There are examples of international best practice in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom where this area is subject to regulation.  Questions arise in terms of the role of local authorities in that regard but I support the proposal in the Bill for another authority, one that will take the issues on board and get involved in licensing and regulation.  I support the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach  (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I apologise for the non-attendance of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who has other appointments today.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I thank Deputy Broughan for publishing this Bill, availing of the Friday facility for Private Members' Bills and for providing the opportunity to discuss this matter.  While the Bill does provide a useful opportunity to discuss the issues involved, it does not provide a useful basis on which legislation in this area could proceed.  He will be aware that related matters have been raised by other Members of this House, in particular regarding the costs of burial plots and the wider funeral industry.  While the Bill does not cover these areas, I recognise the interest of other Members of the House in this area.  The main legislative provisions currently dealing with the provision, management, regulation and control of burial grounds by local authorities are contained, in the first instance, in Part III of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878.  However, these provisions were amended by Part VI of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 and, more recently, by the Local Government Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The setting up and operation of crematoria is not specifically regulated in current legislation; however, the establishment and operation of a crematorium is subject to the provisions of other legislation such as the Planning and Development Acts, the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Air Pollution Act 1987.  The requirements may include the need for planning permission, an EPA licence or an air pollution licence.  The provisions of Deputy Broughan's Bill have been closely examined.  While it presents an earnest attempt to deal with the issues he has discussed, the Government is opposing it for a number of reasons, primarily because its provisions do not effectively deal with all the areas that would need to be dealt with under such legislation.  The Government also has serious concerns on the proposal to establish a new agency as envisaged in the Bill, especially given Government policy regarding agencies and quangos and the resource and cost implications of such proposals, which are critical within the context of the current financial situation in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">There are a number of critical matters that the Bill does not provide for and which could be regarded as fundamental.  I will make brief reference to some of the shortfalls.  While the Bill concentrates on the establishment and functions of the authority, there is little of real substance in the Bill dealing with the regulations envisaged for either crematoria or cemeteries.  Even the detail involved in the establishment and operation of the authority is not fully addressed in the Bill.  For example, there is no definition of what quorum would be required for matters requiring a vote; neither is there a provision for the drawing up or publication of annual accounts nor for the possible winding up of the authority.  There is no reference in the Bill to allowing a Minister to give direction to the authority on policy matters, something that would be vital to the correct running of such an authority.  Furthermore, there are no provisions for expenses, remuneration, pension payments and the like for members or staff, and no rules for the absence of a member or chairperson.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">While the Bill does refer in general terms to a requirement for operators to give notice of the opening or closing of a crematorium or cemetery and the requirement to keep the crematorium or cemetery in good condition, there is no reference to more specific requirements.  For example, no specific requirements are set out that would have to be met by an operator in order for his establishment to be approved by the authority.  There is no reference in the Bill to guidelines or further regulations that would or should be produced to ensure consistent and effective operation of such establishments.  In short, there is no provision in the Bill for regulation-making power to set standards or provide guidance, which I understand is the very purpose of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Other difficulties in the Bill include the absence of provision for the official appointment of authorised persons; no powers of entry without a warrant; no power to direct an operator to carry out a particular function; no set time periods provided to comply with a course of action directed by the authority and, rather tellingly, no express power provided to the authority to take punitive steps against an operator who fails to comply with any standards or rules in place.  Indeed, there is no reference at all to sanctions in the Bill.  No recognition is given in the Bill to existing provisions contained in the Acts and regulations currently on the Statute Book and which govern burial grounds.  While some of this legislation is quite old, it has served us well and will continue to do so.  If and when changes to these regulations are required, these changes will be duly considered and made.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Calls for a review of this legislation in recent times have been more to do with the costs involved in funerals in general, and the cost of burial plots in particular.  The current legislation does not address costs, nor should it.  Equally, the Bill does not refer in any way to costs.  The cost of funerals in general, and burial plots in particular, are not matters that should be dealt with through legislation.  These are matters for the providers of such services and any problems in these areas should be addressed directly to the providers involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The proposal in section 3 of the Bill that the Minister establish strategic plans on a ten-year basis for the planning, building, operation and maintenance of all cemeteries and crematoria is not acceptable to the Government.  The emphasis in recent years across Government has been one of subsidiary - allowing decisions to be made locally, at the lowest possible level.  This is already the case in this area.  The Local Government Act 1994 specifically removed the Minister from the previously held role of involvement in dealing with restrictions on places where bodies may be buried and restriction on exhumations.  Instead, it gives this responsibility to local authorities.  This allows decision making in these matters to be made at a local level where local knowledge is readily available.  Neither the Minister nor the Department should be dictating from afar what should be done in a county or city council area with regard to crematoria and cemeteries when these decisions can be, should be and currently are being made at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The establishment of a burial and cremation regulatory authority, as proposed, is not acceptable to the Government.  As already stated, there is a requirement to examine carefully the financial implications of the establishment of any proposed new agency.  The Bill states that the authority would consist of not more than seven members.  It also refers to the chief executive and staff of the authority.  No doubt the agency would have to secure office space, office equipment and a new logo.  It would have to pay for stationery, telephones, light and heating, and all other necessary administrative supports.  This is not acceptable at a time when the Government is looking to reduce the number of State agencies and the number of State employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Bill states that the authority would be self-financing.  This is not really the case, as it is proposed that the authority would charge a cemetery levy on all cemetery and crematoria operators.  Given that the majority of cemeteries are operated by local authorities, this levy would result in the majority of the authority's finances being sourced from the local authorities.  We all know the current difficulties with regard to the financial situation in the country, and in particular the situation with regard to financing of local authorities.  It would be wrong, especially in the current economic environment, to levy the local authorities with a charge of this kind, given that these authorities are the very organisations that are operating the majority of the cemeteries.  It must be assumed that the local authorities, and, indeed, the private operators of cemeteries and crematoria, would simply pass such a charge on to the public through higher costs for funerals, thus increasing the cost of an already expensive service.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The Bill contains no principles or policies regarding the amount of the levy and there is no cap in place to set a maximum level.  Neither is there any detail as to its application to existing public or private operators.  Furthermore, section 6 of the Bill proposes that the authority would have national responsibility for the long-term maintenance of all cemeteries.  This proposal could have serious and costly implications for the authority.  It means that the operators of all cemeteries, both public and private, would have an opt-out from maintenance of their establishments, leaving the proposed new authority responsible for such maintenance and, ultimately, for the costs which would result from this.  It would be irresponsible of us to allow for such a serious and significant option to be available to operators of cemeteries - it could result in a serious financial burden for the proposed authority in future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Finally, I would point out that the Bill makes no reference to offences, fines or penalties that would arise if operators of cemeteries or crematoria operated without approval of the authority.  Nor does it deal with the situation with regard to currently operating establishments, how these should be approved, timescales for this process, etc.  There is also no indication of how the proposed authority might enforce closure of either a previously approved or a non-approved operation and what consequences there would be for the operator and establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">I thank Deputy Broughan for the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  We have an obligation to carefully analyse any proposal that comes before the House.  Having analysed this Bill, it is clear that the contents are not comprehensive enough to adequately address the issues involved in this area.  Crucially, we must question whether there is a real need to enact such legislation at all, especially given the current need to use limited resources to address the most pressing needs of our communities and the need to ensure that available resources are used in the most productive way possible.  I trust that this House will appreciate that for the reasons given, the Government cannot support this Bill proceeding through the House on this occasion.  I give the House an assurance, however, that the issues will be monitored on an ongoing basis and will be addressed if and when required in a considered, proportionate and effective way.</p>

        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_683">I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important subject.  It is something we all go through in our lives, whether with a family member such as a mother or father, and it is a distressing period where many families are exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">It used to be said that the two things one could not avoid were death and taxes.  I am not too sure whether in this country over the past decade one could avoid taxes - the previous Administration left quite a number of people away with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Deputy Broughan's Bill is not about creating a new agency or quango, but dealing in a positive manner with what is going on in graveyards and crematoriums.  Although the number of cremations is quite small by international standards, it is growing.  I certainly see this in the Dublin area, where the number is growing at a rapid rate and crematoria are now part of the funeral industry - we should call this an industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The funeral industry in Ireland is not being regulated.  I believe strongly that it is in need of reform and regulation and that this is not happening at present.  The small charge of €25 under the Bill, whether it is accepted or not, is a tiny percentage of the graveyard and crematoria costs currently incurred.  If it gave comfort to the public to know that the area was properly regulated and properly managed, and people were not being ripped off, it would be €25 well spent.  I would support that within the formula of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Other Members mentioned something I raised when I was a member of a local authority in that cremation poses a problem regarding emissions.  There is a strong role, both for local authorities and the EPA, in monitoring the mercury element in that regard.  That has not been dealt with to date and it needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to give those living in and around those areas confidence that it is properly monitored and controlled.  Regulation in Ireland on this is weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I would like to see a comprehensive examination of the costs of burial plots and the opening of graves.  On the monopoly system, I am not too sure what happens in the rest of the country, but there is clearly a monopoly situation within the Dublin area.  When families are distressed, I believe there has been an element in the past of families being ripped off in some instances.  Deputies Dowds and Maloney raised that matter well on previous occasions.  I take the point of the Minister of State that there is a shortfall in the Bill, but it is difficult for a single Member to bring forward a Bill which does not have shortfalls.  I would like to think this Bill is the beginning of a conversation and debate.  Death arrives at families in a very sudden manner and people are not reassured that they are not being ripped off on such occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  It is a timely debate.  I would not like to think that because the debate is being held on Friday we would go away and forget about it until another newspaper runs a story about how much the funeral industry is ripping people off.  I hope the Minister of State takes on board the intentions of the Bill.  Let us build on them and give reassurance to families that at a very distressing time they are not ripped off, but that the cremation industry will be properly regulated and people can have confidence in it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickNulty" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Deputy Patrick Nulty</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I commend my colleague, Deputy Broughan, for bringing the Bill before the House.  I wholeheartedly agree with the comments of Deputy Humphreys.  All areas of social and economic life require democratic and transparent regulation.  We know more acutely in this country than perhaps anywhere else in the world what happens when areas of life are not regulated properly.  The people we represent deal with that reality every single day of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Death is an issue that affects every family and is a very sensitive area.  Aspects of it, if required, should be regulated through legislation.  Bereaved loved ones are entitled to the utmost dignity and respect regardless of income, social class or geographic location.  This Bill can give society confidence that the Oireachtas is cognisant of that fact.  As has been said, cremation is on the rise in Ireland with figures indicating about 6% of those who pass away are cremated.  It is clear that cremations will continue to increase as time goes by, which is why there is an urgent need for regulation.  Therefore, it is vital that citizens have confidence that the State is aware that as life is changing and the life cycle develops the State and Oireachtas are able to legislate and respond.  I welcome the fact that the Bill includes a self-financing mechanism for the new agency.  There is nothing wrong with establishing agencies to regulate areas of life provided they are required and appropriate.  In this situation that may well be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Those working with the bereaved should welcome the Bill as it puts clear standards and expectations in place.  Like many aspects of local development, this area shows the need for proper planning and development.  As a former member of Fingal County Council I share the acknowledgement by Deputy Broughan of the work done by Deputy Coyle and all the other Labour Party councillors on Fingal County Council.  In my area the need to identify areas for new graveyards is crucial and it is vital that the local authority responds to that need.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">In terms of the need for good planning, I would like to put on the record of the House the outstanding work done on the north side of Dublin by my colleagues the Minister, Deputy Burton, and former Deputy Seán Ryan who was ably succeeded by Deputy Brendan Ryan, who championed the need for proper planning and sustainable development, often in the face of criticism from developers and, in particular, elements within the Fianna Fáil Party who have not championed good planning and sustainable development over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I commend this excellent Bill and hope, as Deputy Humphreys said, that if for technical reasons it cannot be accepted today, the issue will come before the House again and we can ensure there is proper regulation of cremation.  It is in the interests of already excellent providers to ensure there is best practice in the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_695">I thank my colleague, Deputy Broughan, for raising this issue.  I take the response of the Minister of State on board, namely, that the Government cannot support the Bill.  I support the substantive issues proposed in it.  I am delighted the Minister of State said the issues will be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">As everybody knows, this is an emotive issue.  I am from a rural constituency where anyone who wants to be cremated has to drive to Dublin.  I would like that situation to change.  As Deputy Humphreys said, the only two certainties in life are death and taxes.  Death is something we will all have to deal with at one time or another.  I thank Deputy Broughan for his hard work.  The Bill has revealed that there are difficulties in this country with regard to funerals, burials, cremations and afterlife care.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I was quite amazed to find this area is not on a statutory footing.  Local authorities have responsibility for graveyards and graveyard maintenance.  We have come a long way from a situation where benevolent farmers gave fields to villages to be used as burial plots.  I was quite surprised to find there are currently no barriers to entry and no licensing of an industry responsible for the burial and cremation of up to 30,000 people a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I did not think Deputy Broughan advocated a move away from local authorities, but perhaps he can clarify that in his summation.  There are up to 600 funeral directors in Ireland, of which fewer than 100 operate full time.  Many operate other businesses.  People who were interviewed by the forum quote problems like funeral directors not having enough staff and incidents of neglect, misconduct and, perhaps more worryingly, unqualified people carrying out specific technical and important duties like embalming.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The varying degrees in standards in practice and facilities tend to have a negative impact on grieving families as their needs are not met.  At a time such as the passing of a loved one it is simply not good enough to have below par services which cost a substantial amount of money.  There was also evidence of invoices which had no itemisations outlined on them and ambiguous invoices being issued.  There were reports of hospital and mortuary staff being petitioned by funeral companies to encourage business.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">While historically it has not been a very popular choice, there has been an increase in those seeking cremation as an end of life option.  There does not seem to be any regulation of the area.  As Deputy Broughan pointed out, if somebody can obtain planning permission he or she can open a crematorium.  I talked to some local authority staff to find out their policy on cremation, burial grounds and how we will deal with this situation in the future.  They said they did not have a policy and they were unsure if it was a planning matter.  They felt it was more of an environmental matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">It is a matter for planning and environment departments.  Local authorities did not think there was such criteria and said they did not have a defined policy on this issue because there was no national policy.  Perhaps it is time that we decided on a national policy.  I was startled to find that previous Governments had a lack of policy on this issue.  Local authorities have environmental SPCs.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Perhaps the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government could send a directive to local authorities to instruct them that this is another area for which we need to devise a policy so we can proceed with clarity in future.  I support the substantive issues raised in the Bill and I congratulate Deputy Broughan.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_703">I thank the Minister of State and the Acting Chairman for being here as well as our other colleagues, Deputy Ó Feargháil, Deputy Brian Stanley, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and my party colleagues, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, Deputy Pat Nulty and Deputy Ann Phelan for taking part in the debate on this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I brought forward the Bill to try to start a wider debate and to bring to the attention of colleagues in the House the lacunae and the significant gaps I have found in legislation in this area, especially in the case of crematoriums.  My meetings with stakeholders brought home to me the difficulties.  I could not believe there was no law for crematoriums.  The Minister of State indicated he would keep the matter under review but this is an important and highly sensitive aspect of our lives and those of our families.  Yet, there is no relevant law in this State.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State, the Minister responsible, Deputy Phil Hogan, and our other colleagues in Government to bring forward legislation to address the matter, or simply to take the legislation in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and implement it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Earlier I quoted extensively from the Forum on End of Life in Ireland, an outstanding body made up of all stakeholders in this area.  Ms Angela Edghill of the forum contacted Members this morning by e-mail stating the forum is keen to see a wider holistic legislative response to the issues involved in this area since the funeral, cremation and embalming service industries are among the least regulated businesses in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Since publishing the Bill in 2011 I have accepted the issues relating to section 3, which deals with the functions of a cremation regulatory authority.  In my 20 years in the House as a member of the Labour Party I have invigilated hundreds of Bills including dozens dealing with the setting up of new bodies.  I am well aware of the important sections which would require a vote relating to functions of any proposed body.  The Minister of State indicated that the areas of sanctions and penalties and full administration are not addressed.  I accept the point made about staff.  I envisage a small staff of perhaps between four and six people and that stakeholders would be involved on the board.  Section 3 needs to be expanded to include the invigilation of the funeral directors industry as well as the provision and maintenance of burial grounds and crematoriums.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Almost all of my colleagues have referred to the role of local authorities.  I enjoyed being a member of Dublin City Council for many years and I continue to liaise closely with the city council and Fingal County Council, the two councils covering the area I represent in the Dáil.  I have always believed in increasing the powers of councils.  I envisage a continued role for councils because they are the effective owners of many burial grounds.  As the Minister of State and others suggested, they have a role through their environment departments in maintaining historic burial grounds.  The role of local authorities is paramount.  I thought deeply about this when I was studying the establishment of an authority and I deliberated on whether the local authority route or reform of the Local Government Act were appropriate methodologies to address these matters.  However, my experience of several recent applications has raised some issues.  I made a submission on behalf of Dublin North-East and Dublin North constituents some weeks ago related to a major new private development which is directly on the flight path of and close to the main runway of Dublin Airport.  At present the local authorities do not have the expertise or legislative clout to address adequately such proposals, especially in respect of long-term maintenance.  I quoted Councillor Peter Coyle on this issue several times.  One may produce a proposal but for graveyards, the most holy of places for our deceased, one must include plans for 40, 50 and 60 years into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Some years ago I studied history at third level.  I remember examining graveyards from the 17th century in Wexford, my ancestral county, parts of the midlands and other parts of Ireland.  I was always struck by how carefully people from as far back as the 17th and 18th century tried to preserve these memorials in such a way that someone studying the area 200 years later could study adequately the history of their native place or surrounding districts.  I envisage the local authorities being heavily involved even if we go down the route proposed, that is, through the Department or the HSE.  One proposal involves a unit in one of these bodies to bring an overarching approach to the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The Minister of State referred to the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878.  I learned from my colleague, Councillor Peter Coyle, that section 174 of the Act forbids the location of a cemetery less than 100 yards from a dwelling house.  It is not possible to propose a cemetery within 100 yards of a dwelling house.  This is the law as it stands.  However, there is no such restriction on a crematorium.  Let us consider urban crematoriums.  Urban or town public representatives could be faced with a proposal for a crematorium close to residential accommodation.  These are some of the proposals our councillor colleagues in the local authorities are trying to grapple with.  I believe profoundly that we need a comprehensive licensing and legislation system for the sustainable operation and management of cemeteries and crematoriums.  While researching the area I noticed there is a plethora of applications for cemeteries, for green graveyards and crematoriums throughout the country, including in South Tipperary, Wicklow and County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Bill started life as an effort to bring in some rules.  I was hoping the Minister responsible, Deputy Phil Hogan, would introduce a statutory instrument to the House to deal with the invigilation of crematoriums.  Between 12% to 15% of people who die in the country are cremated.  I referred to comparable statistics in other jurisdictions throughout the world.  All the indications are that the numbers will increase here.  At present any private operator can set up a crematorium once they have general planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The Minister of State referred to EPA approval.  Air quality emissions is one of the key issues that has not been addressed and that the local authorities find difficult to address.  The Forum on End of Life in Ireland has stated that annual emissions of mercury from dental fillings in crematoriums in the European Union are between two and five tonnes.  The UK Federation Of Burial and Cremation Authorities estimates that approximately 16% of all UK mercury emissions are from crematoriums.  This figure may rise to 25% by 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">One of our most important cemeteries, Mount Jermone cemetery in Harold's Cross, has installed a new filtration system and a new crematory furnace.  The staff have indicated that they are now compliant with the latest EU environmental legislation.  Mount Jermone cemetery is home to 250,000 of our predecessors.  Between it and Glasnevin, some 1.5 million people who lived in this city and region over centuries have their final resting place.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">My colleagues and I have stressed the importance of the long-term maintenance of graveyards.  I have several examples in my constituency of Dublin North-East which relate specifically to drainage issues.  These are Balgriffin, a major cemetery in the heart of my constituency run by Fingal County Council; Dardistown, which forms part of the Glasnevin Trust; and the very historic cemetery at St. Mary's Abbey in Howth.  A former Labour Party councillor, Ms Anne Carter, raised the major flooding and drainage problems at Balgriffin and Dardistown on several occasions in Dublin City Council.  Again, there did not seem to be any prescription in regard to drainage, which is just as vital as air emissions in cemeteries.  Relatives of deceased persons buried at Balgriffin have been very upset to see new graves completely waterlogged as a result of flooding of the nearby river.  These drainage issues have not been dealt with either by Fingal County Council or the Glasnevin Trust.  Before Christmas last year bad weather led to major flooding on the Howth Peninsula, resulting in a whole section of the graveyard at St. Mary's Abbey being washed down and several coffins of recently deceased persons being opened due to the disturbance of the earth.  Fingal County Council is doing very important work in restoring the walls and graves.  These three examples from my constituency show that local authorities must be given stronger powers in this area or else consideration should be given to establishing an overarching authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">An issue I did not have time to address in my opening statement is the assessment of future burial needs.  The current economic crisis has placed a question mark over the ambitious predictions for the State's population growth in the coming decades.  Unfortunately, the equivalent number of people in a full Croke Park on all-Ireland day left the country last year, despite the Government's best efforts to address the crisis.  The recent census figures showed that half of the approximately 78,000 people who left our shores last year were native Irish people.  As such, the projections for a population of 6 million plus by the end of the decade commencing in 2020 may not come to fruition.  We must all hope the Government will be successful in addressing the macroeconomic situation, notwithstanding my opposition to some of its policies, and that the population will continue to rise.  In that context, there is great concern among communities, particularly in the greater Dublin area but also in towns throughout the country, that it will be increasingly difficult for bereaved families to access a burial plot at a reasonable distance from their home.  Sligo County Council prepared a very interesting burial ground policy for the period from 2006 to 2010, something which all local authorities, if they have not done so already, should replicate.  Sligo County Council's survey in 2005 showed that in ten key burial grounds in the county, space was either limited or non-existent.  Part of the work of a regulatory authority such as the one I have proposed in the Bill would be to plan for future needs in an holistic way across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">My Labour Party colleagues, Deputies Robert Dowds and Eamonn Maloney, and others referred to the increasing cost of burial plots and charges for the opening of graves, as recently covered in the media.  For instance, South Dublin County Council recently hiked the cost of plots from €1,200 to €1,800, while prices are also to rise in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Deputy Dowds highlighted the incredible prices being charged in some Dublin cemeteries, with one Dublin family paying €6,000 for a plot in Palmerstown.  Cremation with an urn now costs between €596 and €626 at Glasnevin, with such fees formerly generally running at approximately €500.  The cost of cremation and being placed in a column-bearing wall is now €1,296.  This is another area in which administrative oversight could be assumed by a burial regulatory authority.  I mentioned in my opening contribution that the Forum on End of Life in Ireland is anxious that all undertakers and funeral directors be subject to a full licensing and training programme, as their own association has recommended.  While we all acknowledge the great work done by firms throughout the country, all such operators should be subject to national legislation.  I accept the point made by the Minister of State in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I take the opportunity to refer briefly to green cemeteries and associated new technologies, to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred.  A recent proposal for a green cemetery in County Galway referred to minimal development being necessary because the green infrastructure was already in place.  However, that is not really acceptable in the long term.  I have in mind the new graveyard on Mount Leinster, for example, in which several people I knew have been laid to rest.  This, too, requires long-term care and maintenance.  In the case of the various new developments such as promession and other chemical disposal methods involving liquid nitrogen and so on, as the author of a recent article in <i>The Economist</i> observed, all such new technologies require associated legal frameworks.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Reference was made to a burial regulatory authority being just another quango.  I dislike quangos as much as anybody else, but the Minister of State might have noticed that what is proposed in the Bill is based on the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  Under previous Administrations, I consistently urged the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to introduce such a body.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, finally signed the relevant order in recent days and the authority is being established.  However, the horse has already bolted.  Action was not taken when it was needed most, in 2003 or 2004.  I acknowledge that this was directly and absolutely the fault of Fianna Fáil in government.  However, it now falls to the Minister of State to take on board the issues I am seeking to address by way of this legislation.  He has said he will keep the matter under review.  I hope the Department will examine these proposals and the points made by colleagues and come forward with a plan to legislate.  We are available for discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">These Friday sessions have been very valuable in facilitating Members to bring forward useful legislative proposals.  I contributed to the debate on Deputy Mattie McGrath's Bill some weeks ago.  It would be helpful if Departments engaged to a greater degree with Deputies in bringing forward Private Members' Bills by identifying the gaps in the legislation and suggesting how it could be made better by the insertion of X, Y or Z.  Such co-operation would help to make Bills more Dáil-proof.  Having Friday sittings is a great innovation and the Government deserves to be commended for their introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">On the issue at hand, I reiterate that all of the stakeholders, particularly the Forum on End of Life in Ireland, the Glasnevin Trust and other operators, impressed on me the urgent requirement for legislation on cemeteries and crematoria.  I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, to examine our proposals.</p>
