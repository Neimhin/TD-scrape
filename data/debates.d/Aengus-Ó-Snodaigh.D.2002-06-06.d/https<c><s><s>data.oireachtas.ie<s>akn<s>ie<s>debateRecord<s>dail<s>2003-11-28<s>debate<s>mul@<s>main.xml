        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. M. Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003. In recent years, the cost of insurance has become a major issue of concern. It was realised that something had to be done, especially about the cost of motor insurance for young drivers and the rising cost of employers' liability and public liability insurance. The cost of insurance was one of the main issues raised during the last general election campaign. The Bill before the House is an attempt to deal with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">In October 2002, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, announced a programme of fundamental insurance reform which reflected commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government. The programme contained a comprehensive set of measures designed to reduce insurance costs and improve the functioning of the insurance market. A key measure of this reform was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending the preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing. I am delighted that the legislation is before the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Our compensation culture, which encourages litigation for personal injury damages, has led to spiralling insurance costs. The system for delivering damages is too expensive. Both businesses and consumers are overburdened when insuring against potential claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">Many issues have been raised in regard to insurance costs in the course of the debatel. Fraudulent claims have been mentioned frequently. I accept that many claims going before the courts are genuine. However, fraudulent claims have been a contributory factor to the high cost of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Rising premiums have had a negative effect on businesses and jobs. The cost of insurance tops the Small Firms Association's list of obstacles to business. Some 19% of respondents ranked it as their main problem and 83% considered it a business problem. Insurance costs increased by an average 52% to May 2003, but many companies have had increases in the region of 70%. Commercial liability insurance now costs an estimated €2 billion annually. Insurance fraud is estimated to cost over €100 million a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Litigation costs are estimated to increase insurance costs by more than one third. A newspaper report yesterday indicated that there had been a striking decline in the number of personal injuries cases initiated in the High Court and the Circuit Court. This was attributed to the effectiveness of the advertisement campaign focused on fraudulent claims. The campaign by the Irish Insurance Federation to root out fraudulent claims has been successful. The abolition of no foal, no fee advertising by solicitors has also been a contributory factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">In 2001 just over 19,000 High Court writs were issued, of which 80% related to personal injuries cases. In 2002, this fell to 16,400. The number of High Court writs issued to date in 2003 is down to 12,253. A similar decline in new proceedings was also evident in the Circuit Court. Judges have also adopted a more balanced approach to the concept of duty of care. This involves the acts and omissions that are to be considered negligent, and who is liable to pay compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Increased awareness on the part of employers in regard to health and safety has resulted in fewer employer liability claims. Since the introduction of the penalty points system fewer motor accidents have occurred and this has also contributed to a decrease in personal injuries claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board is expected to have a strong consumer focus and also to bring a balance of expertise to bear on what has been a difficult aspect of the insurance market. Its primary focus will be on the development of a pragmatic and workable system for handling insurance claims for the benefit of claimants and policy holders in general. The interim board concentrated on building relationships with the industry and other proprietary work to enable the statutory board to begin its operations immediately the legislation was passed. The PIAB is not designed to reduce levels of compensation. Its function is to reduce the cost of delivering it.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has estimated the board will operate under an annual budget of around €8 million. Once it has begun hearing cases, it will employ approximately 100 staff and will deal with 227,000 cases annually. The chairman of the PIAB told the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that 300 doctors had applied to act as independent medical assessors on behalf of the board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill will place the board on a statutory footing. The board's objective will be to assess compensation at current levels more expediently while eliminating the excessive litigation overhead.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">This Bill is before the House because of the high cost of insurance over the years. In my own area I have heard many cases of people receiving €60,000, €80,000 or a couple of hundred thousand in compensation. When major awards are made, there is always a question of whether they are fraudulent. It is not before time to introduce this legislation. All the research which has been done since 1998 when the report on motor insurance was published has shown the legal profession in a particularly bad light. There are many questions to be asked about the contribution of medical professionals to the cost of claims. It behoves claimants and professionals acting on their behalf to ensure that the best possible standards apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will offer speedier assessment which will benefit genuine claimants. Research shows that Irish claimants wait six times longer than their UK counterparts for negotiations on claims to commence. One of the major provisions of this Bill relates to the book of quantum. A book outlining the average awards for specific personal injuries will be compiled and published as a guideline to general damages. It should help parties to reach reasonable negotiated settlements without recourse to either the board or the courts. If parties do not accept the outcome of the PIAB assessment, they may reject the award. The claimant will be issued with a release certificate to enable him or her to commence proceedings within six months if it is decided to pursue a case further.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Previous settlements in the form of insurance payments or any other form of compensation, will be taken into account when awards are made. The costs of the board will be covered by fees levied on respondents on a case-by-case basis reflective of the actual complexity and work involved. Claimants will pay a small, refundable fee which must accompany their application for assessment if they have not been able to secure a satisfactory settlement directly. Claims will initially be made in the usual way against the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">A great deal of work has been done by various parties. We must commend the work which has been done by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. It has made a notable contribution to the insurance debate. Under the chairmanship of Deputy Cassidy, the committee has published an interim report outlining the significant work it has performed in a very short space of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Sections 39 to 43 of the Bill make provisions in respect of the legal status of the PIAB's order to pay. An order to pay will have the same status as a court decree. Some of the people who have contacted me to discuss the Bill have asked if we are moving the issue of insurance compensation away from the courts. They have asked about the legal status of this Bill's provisions. The order to pay will have the same status as a court order. That payments will be made to a claimant on foot of the order to cover costs is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">To sell the legislation to the wider world, we must ensure that we are not merely establishing another body. We must ensure that when the board commences its operations we see a gradual reduction in insurance costs. The cost of insurance to young drivers, employers, etc., must be reflective of the cost of claims. Right up to 2003, many stories have been told about the excessive cost of insurance, particularly for young drivers whose premia were three times more expensive than the purchase price of their vehicles. The example of a sub-contractor in the building trade was outlined to me. In 2001, his insurance cost was £1,400 but in 2002 the least expensive quote he could find was €10,000. Today, the contractor's premium is in the region of €16,000 to €17,000. Many health and safety regulations have been introduced to deal with the building industry. There is less likelihood of an accident on any building site now than there was three or four years ago, but that has not been reflected in the levels of premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I commend the Bill to the House. It is my hope that through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board we will see a massive improvement in cover for every motorist, employer and self-employed business person. I commend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the work she has done on this issue. She has shown a great deal of commitment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. While I welcome the publication of the Public Injuries Assessment Board Bill, I must ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment why it has taken so long to get to this point. If one looks back at the history of this legislation, one will see that my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, published a report as Minister of State in 1997. The report recommended the establishment of a board similar to the one which is the subject of the Bill before the House. The board was to be modelled on the Employment Appeals Tribunal. It was intended to deal with insurance claims which were uncontested and could therefore be addressed outside the courts system. Why have the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government dragged their feet for so long in bringing us to the point at which we can discuss this Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_19">There has long been a great need to address the problem of the cost of insurance across society and the economy. I would have expected a greater sense of urgency in view of the extent to which insurance costs have affected other areas for which the Minister has responsibility. Industry is significantly affected in terms of underlying running costs. We have seen companies fold due to the cost of insurance. I am acquainted with the joint owner of a company which had to close its business about a year ago on account of the spiralling cost of insurance. Fortunately the person is now doing well in another area.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The cost of high insurance to the economy and society is huge. Many voluntary and community organisations cannot operate because of the cost of insurance. In places where a local national school might have been available to community organisations for activities some years ago, the organisations are now being refused permission to use the school because of the cost of insurance and the fear that somebody will make a claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Motor insurance, particularly the cost of insurance for young drivers, is an area which has been highlighted. The motor insurance advisory body, under Dorothea Dowling, published an interim report in March 2001 which illustrated that the claims of the insurance industry that young drivers were costly and should pay high premiums were false. For drivers of 23 years of age premiums exceeded claims by up to £255 per policy while female drivers aged 19 to 20 years delivered a profit of £730 each to insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Will the Minister inform us whether this aspect has been addressed? Where insurance companies were clearly making considerable extra profits, is she satisfied that there is now real competition in the industry with respect to insurance paid by young drivers? Is the industry being properly monitored in terms of the kinds of profits insurance companies continue to make from insuring young drivers. It is evident that insurance companies still make huge profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Fraudulent claims are an issue about which I wish to make a point. The attitude of society is that if people can make a quick buck or euro, they should take the chance and do so. It is part of our "mé féin" culture which I suggest is probably driven by the policies of the Minister's party where the profit motive and the individual appear to be the core of what matters. People have lost their sense of solidarity. Many of them have given up on the belief that we are all in this together and should not cause other people's premiums to rise by making fraudulent claims. This attitude transfers to other areas also. People who win a lot of money invest their money abroad. People avoid tax because they do not feel they should contribute to the general pot to provide for schools, hospitals etc. We need to address the broad morality of this issue to return to the kind of social solidarity which appears to have been thrown out the window under the policies and ethos of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The Labour Party welcomes this legislation. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, addressed the issue yesterday and both he and Deputy Lynch have played an active part on the committee which has done a great deal of work in this area. I call on the Minister, as the political leader in the area, to bring a sense of urgency to this huge issue which is causing much distress across the country. Some 42% of compensation costs go to the legal profession. The legal free zone provided by this board will create an opportunity to remove some of those costs and this is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The establishment of the board seems to be a sensible and straightforward approach to the area of non-contested claims. The decisions will largely be made on the basis of paperwork and reports without the necessity for people to go in and argue their case. Where there is agreement among the parties on liability, it is only a matter of deciding on what the award should be. This is a sensible way to approach the issue. The sooner the board is up and running, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It should be noted that the board will not be a major cost to the Exchequer. Cost of initial implementation is estimated at €2 million, a small amount of money considering the amount at stake in terms of the economic and social life of the country. That is all the more reason we must ask why this and other actions recommended by the MIAB have not been initiated – most of the large number of proposals made by it have not yet been addressed. Once the board is established it is intended that the fees levied on respondents will pay for the operation of the PIAB. This points further to the necessity to ask why it is taking so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">The initial remit of the board will relate to employers' liability and will commence in January. This will be followed in 2004 by general liability and motor accident insurance. Will the Minister ensure that the board carries through with this timeframe? While employers' liability is a large part of the equation, and is of serious concern to the Department, general liability and motor accidents are of concern to the public. A growing number of motorists cannot afford insurance premiums and take the risk of driving without insurance. We condemn that because serious problems are caused for people involved in accidents with uninsured drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">One hope is that this measure, in bringing some motor accident cases under the auspices of the PIAB, will reduce premiums and costs. I hope we see reductions quickly. How will the Minister monitor insurance companies to ensure they do not absorb savings where cases are settled more cheaply under the PIAB? It is crucial that this money returns to those who pay premiums rather than into the pockets of the insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">As education spokesperson for my party, I wish to raise the specific issue of insurance for schools. All Deputies received a letter recently from George O'Callaghan on behalf of the joint managerial body of secondary schools, excepting vocational and community schools. Many of the schools are non-fee paying and have serious financial problems. The letter informed us that insurance costs for secondary schools have doubled in the past five years. The JMB made a pre-budget submission seeking an extra €50 in capitation grant per pupil to pay for insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">Information I got from the JMB gave an example of a school where in two years insurance increased by €100 per student. Insurance was based on the number of pupils in the school and the premium doubled to €60,000, which equated to €100 extra per student. Schools get a set capitation grant and have no other way of raising funds to pay insurance fees apart from fundraising through cake sales, sponsored walks etc. The point was made that this cost is beyond the control of schools. The only way they can raise the funds is through fundraising, but parents are already hard-pressed for contributions, particularly in the less well off schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I would not shed too many tears for the richer fee-paying schools, but I am concerned about ordinary secondary schools that are trying to find an extra €50 or €100 per pupil to meet their insurance costs. Will the Minister redouble her efforts in this urgent issue? I do not know whether many schools will be covered by the PIAB and therefore benefit from reduced costs. Schools believe they should contest some cases. A person may be injured at a school, for example, but there may be no evidence to suggest that the school was at fault. I presume that many cases will still have to go to the courts, but it is to be hoped that some problems will be addressed under the PIAB structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I have outlined my main concerns about the Bill. I stress the huge costs in this regard. I do not know if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has assessed the costs for industry and those who create and try to maintain jobs. Many small indigenous companies have problems with the cost of insurance because they have low turnovers. Such companies, which may be competing against industries in the Far East and other places where costs are lower, have great difficulties in maintaining their staffing levels. I do not know if insurance factors contributed to the difficulties at Dairygold in recent days, but they contributed to job losses in recent years at smaller firms in the Limerick region and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">This is a small measure, but I welcome it nonetheless. I urge that the Bill be implemented as soon as possible. We should keep to the timetable, especially in respect of the plans for next year. Developments in this area should be monitored to ensure that insurance companies do not cream off the profits that accrue. The other MIAB recommendations should be implemented as soon as possible. The sense of urgency has been sadly lacking in this issue and many others the Government has faced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnEllis" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_34">Like most other Members, I welcome the Bill. This legislation has been threatened for some time. The decision taken by the Government is to be welcomed by everybody affected by insurance costs, such as litigants or those who pay public liability insurance. All Deputies are aware that excess costs have been associated with small claims. Legal fees have outweighed the value of claims in many cases. We welcome the fact that, under the new system, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will deal with small claims in which the question of liability does not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">All public representatives have received representations from the various legal societies and associations in our constituencies. It is natural that people who feel threatened should make representations to us. However, many of the fears expressed are not well-founded. I accept that some of the legal profession's concerns about the Personal Injuries Assessment Board may have some merit, but many of them are not shared by ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Not long after it was elected in 1997, the previous Government decided that something had to be done to deal with insurance claims. We are aware of the sort of claims that have been made. The significant reduction in the past 12 months in the number of claims being made in the courts has resulted from the fact that spurious claims are being contested. The insurance companies have a great deal for which to answer because, over the years, they did not contest many claims made against them. An unfortunate policyholder who reports a claim may not hear anything about it until he or she opens the next renewal bill. Only then would he or she discover that his or her insurance costs had greatly increased. When one telephones the company in such circumstances, one may be told that the claim one made has been settled. It is terrible that one might not have been aware of the development until that point. Insurance companies find in many cases that it is easier to pay a claim rather than to contest it.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Private individuals who carry their own insurance and contest every case have proved that a level of abuse has taken place in respect of insurance claims, especially personal injuries claims. It is clear that many such claims are bogus, to put it mildly. On the other hand, some reasonably genuine cases may not have taken the same route as that being taken by professional litigants. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should try to put together a dossier of those who have been involved in claims in the past ten or 15 years. Such a system would quickly show the names of those who have made many similar claims in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Many personal injury claims never get to court. There are more settlements on the steps of the Four Courts and other courthouses than there are in court. When we examine the figures, we see that just 10% of cases are decided on by a judge. This proves to me that there is much scope for negotiation about the settlement of claims. The Bill will provide for such negotiation by establishing the PIAB to fill a vacuum that has existed for some time. It will help to bring about speedier settlement of small claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I have some concerns about the representation of those who will appear before the PIAB. We all accept that medical reports are fine as doctors will do their best to give a true account of a person's injuries, but there is a danger that some people may end up suffering at a later stage as a result of what was initially a minor injury. We cannot, however, deal with this problem in the context of this Bill. There needs to be a form of redress if a person's problems can be proved to have resulted from a small injury that may have occurred years previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I do not have a great problem with the time limitations provided for in the Bill. That people have such a long time to make a claim means that injured parties and those who may be negligent can be left in limbo for some time. This is not in the best interests of either party. I welcome the fact that claims must be made within a specified period. I hope payments will be made quickly and efficiently when cases are settled after everything has been considered. The public will reach a harsh judgment if payments are not made within a short time of agreement being reached. We know that the question of negligence does not arise under the provisions of this Bill. Cases that will be dealt with by the PIAB will be those in which liability has been accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">It is unclear who will be responsible for making claims. An injured party will be able to make a claim directly through the PIAB. Who will advise him or her about filling in the claim form and various other documents, however? I hope we will not see the emergence of a new type of unqualified consultant to advise those making claims to the PIAB. It might be easier if a set fee of, for example, €100 or €200, was paid to members of the legal profession in respect of claims to the PIAB because I am fearful that people might set themselves up as advisers in respect of PIAB claims. I would not like to see that happen and I am sure the Minister will see that it does not arise because it is not in the best interest of those making claims or those who want the PIAB to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">It is open to people to have recourse to the courts if they are unhappy with the PIAB claim settlement. I am worried about this because solicitors may well send their clients to the PIAB and if the settlement is unsatisfactory, they will go to court with the result that costs will be carried forward since the judicial system will nearly always find in favour of the injured party. I am not saying a person should be penalised for not accepting his or her award from the PIAB by being awarded a smaller amount when he or she goes to court, but this aspect of the Bill needs to be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">I hope something can be done to prevent this type of scenario arising. It might be better if people, rather than being allowed to go to the Circuit Court after their PIAB settlement offer, are sent to the District Court which has limited jurisdiction in regard to claims. The limit set for the PIAB is equal to that at Circuit Court level. This may make many people feel they are better off going to court and we will need to safeguard against that. We do not have the right to remove citizens' rights to seek redress through the courts but I hope some formula can be put in place to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">The delays in dealing with cases has caused tremendous annoyance to injured parties and those who are responsible and have accepted liability. It is wrong that it takes two or three years to settle agreed claims. I hope there will be a minimum time to have all cases settled from the moment papers are lodged with the PIAB and that respondents have a limited time in which to reply to all queries raised by the other party. In many cases, issues can be dragged out needlessly and people get less from their settlements than they expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Some system with a fixed cost needs to be put in place to enable applicants complete necessary documentation. A solicitor told me that his advice to clients would be to go to the PIAB and if they are unhappy with what they are offered, he would take the matter to the courts. The legal profession obviously sees an opportunity of shadowing claims to the PIAB and this must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The limitation period of one year is a bit short, although we should not allow it to be too long. It is imperative that notice is given within two to three months of a pending claim. If someone fears there may be further injury as a result of the accident, he or she may be entitled to apply to have time before the claim is dealt with to see what the long-term effects of such injuries might be. This needs to be controlled, but common sense should prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The representation in High Court cases dealing with compensation frequently runs to two senior and two junior counsel on each side as well as two solicitors, consultants, doctors and so on, meaning that the estimated cost of a day in the High Court between legal representation and expert witnesses is about €20,000. It is unreal that a doctor or a consultant has to spend a day in court when his or her written or sworn statement should be sufficient. I hope this can be examined by the legal profession and the court system in regard to High Court claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The number of claims over €38,000 is small, amounting to just 4% or 5% of the claims made each year. This underlines the fact that there is an opportunity to deal as quickly as possible with the other 95% of cases within the Circuit Court limit of €38,000. The PIAB will be seen as a starting place by some but it will be seen by reasonable people as a place to deal with their claims as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">The Bill will be judged on how effective the PIAB is when it is up and running. If it does not give an efficient, fast service, we will have major problems persuading people that is the road to take. There is no doubt that time limits should be placed on every stage in the processing of paperwork. If we do not, some people may drag out claims and others, who want to finalise them as quickly as possible, may find that the other side will decide to drag it out. No one wants to see that happen. With the PIAB, there is a move away from the old confrontational approach to claims. There is now an opportunity for personal injuries cases, in which liability has been admitted, to be dealt with in an efficient way. I hope this will be done as quickly as possible in regard to all litigation up to a certain level.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">It is imperative we do something to cut the cost of litigation in personal injury claims. In many cases, the legal costs can be 40% to 50% of the award, on top of what the litigant receives. In some cases, the figure can be 100%. We have all heard the horror stories of cases in which people were granted awards but only received a fraction of them because legal agreements had been entered into before the claims were processed.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">The future advancement of the PIAB method of settlement will be judged on how it works initially. If it works efficiently, other insurance claimants and litigants will be prepared to use a similar system. The Minister is being optimistic in regard to the number of personnel required to run the system. That system will prove far more cost-effective than that which is in place at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">I hope that as a result of this progressive step, the cost of insurance will decrease. We have seen the change that has occurred in the area of motor insurance in the past 12 months. The Minister for Transport and the Government are to be complimented in respect of the penalty points system. When one considers the reductions in the number of road deaths, serious injuries and accidents and the improvement in the way people drive, one can see that where determination is brought to bear the problem of road carnage can be tackled quite effectively. The insurance companies have not, however, decided to pass on to ordinary motorists the savings they are making on claims, the number of which has decreased. I hope that a mechanism will be put in place which will ensure that savings made by insurance companies as a result of Government action and that of the general public will be passed on. The phone-in relating to spurious claims has made those involved in making such claims have second thoughts.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">If members of the public do not see savings in their insurance premiums, be they for public liability, employers' liability, motor, or any other form of insurance, they will become disenchanted with the entire system. We have already seen the effect of insurance claims on employment. In certain industrial sectors, many companies were being forced out of business by rising insurance costs. We must continue to tackle the issue of such costs on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">I welcome the report compiled by Deputy Cassidy and the committee of which he is Chairman. The recommendations contained in that and similar reports should be implemented as quickly as possible. We must ensure that this happens so we can rid ourselves of the compensation culture that had taken hold in Ireland. In implementing the recommendations, however, we must ensure that a balance is achieved and that a situation does not arise where people with genuine claims would be afraid to make them because of a fear they might fail. There could be a serious consequential loss to a person, and his or her family, who takes a genuine case which is subsequently thrown out or lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">I welcome the Bill. I hope that some of the concerns I have expressed in respect of it will be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_59">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. As previous speakers have stated, the question of insurance, which is a matter of concern to people throughout the country, needs to be dealt with urgently. The fact that insurance premiums have doubled in the past two years has given rise to serious difficulties, particularly for small businesses, self-employed people and car owners. Most Members have been approached in recent years by those who run small businesses and self-employed people who indicated that there had been significant increases in the cost of premia. They indicated that but for the costs associated with insurance they would have been able to expand their businesses. This is a major problem and it has proved difficult to solve. There is no doubt that fundamental change is needed in the industry and in terms of the cost of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The Bill is not a panacea for curing all the ills of the insurance industry or bringing about reductions in premia. We should not give the public the impression that it can achieve these things. It has been argued that 40% of the cost of claims relates to legal expenses and that, therefore, if we create a lawyer-free zone or remove legal involvement completely from claims, premia will be automatically reduced by up to 40%. That is not correct and we should not give the impression that it is correct. I am not stating that said impression is being given, but people might infer, from some Members' contributions, that there will be significant reductions in premia. There is no guarantee in the Bill that premia will be reduced. Representatives of the insurance industry who appeared before the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business would not give a guarantee that premia would be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Insurance companies are interested in making profits for themselves and their shareholders. Despite a great deal of publicity to the contrary, they are quite profitable organisations and they made something of the order of €183 million in profits last year. They have been very good at using every avenue to ensure that the cost of premia are maintained at a high level and have used mechanisms such as loading, accounting devices and the smokescreen of the events of 11 September. The latter has been used by insurance companies to maintain or even increase the cost of premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">One of the results of the enactment of this legislation will be higher premia. There is no doubt that any costs incurred by insurance companies in respect of the operation of the PIAB will be passed on to customers. In my view, the Bill contains an in-built increase in premia. In the 1980s, insurance companies carried out a campaign to have juries in compensation claim cases abolished and stated that there would be significant reductions in the cost of claims and premia as a result. This did not happen and the cost of claims doubled. In the interim, the costs of insurance premia have gone through the roof.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The Bill does nothing to change the position <i>vis-à-vis</i>the cost of car insurance for young drivers. We need to deal with this problem as a matter of urgency. Young drivers are incurring significant costs in terms of their car insurance. I am aware of one individual who was quoted €5,600 per annum for insurance and quotes of €2,500 to €3,000 are routine. In many areas there is little or no public transport but young people have to get to work. In Dublin alone, there are of the order of 80,000 people who drive to work each day. That issue will not be dealt with under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">There is also a perception that the legislation is a creature of the insurance companies and that every person who makes a claim is a fraudster. Claims are made that are not genuine and a number of high profile fraudulent claims have been taken. In addition, a number of individuals have made multiple claims against various public utilities, which have proven to be fraudulent. However, the vast majority of claimants are genuine and should be dealt with as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">I welcome the legislation and I hope that, at least, it will ensure claims are dealt with expeditiously and awards are paid quickly. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business recommended that the board should be established immediately. A mechanism should be provided so that claims, which are not disputed in terms of liability, are processed quickly. The legislation offers the possibility that claimants will receive compensation due to them earlier than is the case currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">Everybody accepts, in principle, that the 2% Government levy on insurance premia should be abolished and I urge the Minister to take that step and give a lead in terms of reducing insurance costs. Insurance companies derive significant profits in Ireland, much more, for instance, than they earn from their business in England and there should be leeway for reductions in premia costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Under the PIAB process, an insurance company or other respondent can say at the end of the process they do not accept the decision and they can return to the beginning and contest liability in the courts. That is a flaw in the legislation because it is likely, as Senator Maurice Hayes pointed out in the Seanad, that insurance companies will deliberately flush out the costs to them of cases and then contest them in the courts. There is a danger that if claimants are sucked into the process believing liability will not be contested, by the time it becomes clear the case will be contested, it will be too late for the claimant to collate the expert advice he or she might need to make his or her case. The Minister should insert a provision whereby, if liability is not accepted by an insurance company at the beginning of the process, it cannot subsequently walk away from the decision of the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The resourcing of the board is an issue. It is estimated that 10,000 employer liability cases are taken each year and it will be difficult for the board to process that number of claims. A limit should be put on the time it takes to process a claim, otherwise the process will be hampered.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">I am also worried about the membership of the board. Insurance companies are represented and there may be a constitutional issue because claimants are not. Such companies have legal, actuarial and engineering advice available to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_70">I welcome the Bill. Members of various political parties have called in recent years for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. However, this legislation is the first step in facing up to the difficulties experienced by individuals, companies and the State as a result of spiralling insurance costs. Action to encourage competition within the industry and to tackle bogus claims is still awaited but it is on the Minister's agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">It is widely accepted litigation costs add, on average, in excess of 40% to the costs of compensation claims and this has contributed to the high cost of insurance and the cost of claims against the self-insured sector and the State. Spiralling insurance costs have led to a reduction in our competitiveness as a country and a number of businesses have been forced to close.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Insurance costs in the tourism sector are six times higher than in other European member states. This was highlighted in the recent report, New Horizons for Irish Tourism. The report stated that one of the major disadvantages faced by small businesses in the tourism sector is insurance costs, which adds to their cost base. The industry is accused of being overpriced and uncompetitive but insurance costs are not appreciated by people. Last year, insurance for most tourism providers and products increased by 50%, while over the past three years insurance premia have increased by more than 300% on average through no fault of the providers. Most of them have not had claims against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Reductions in insurance costs in the tourism sector would be welcome. If the Bill contributes to that, it must be welcomed. Tourists say Ireland is pricy but the cost of insurance is one of the reasons for the increase in prices. This cost must be added to the cost of services provided, otherwise people will go out of business. Hopefully, by eliminating the need for litigation costs where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation to the benefit of all consumers. The board will offer a lower cost and speedier means of finalising genuine personal injury claims than the current legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">ISME made a presentation recently to an Oireachtas committee, in which it pointed out the catastrophic impact of escalating insurance costs on the small business sector. The Minister meets the organisation on a regular basis and will be aware of its concerns. ISME stated that 100 companies have closed with the loss of 3,000 jobs in the tourism, engineering, construction and chemical industries. Many companies have been forced to self-insure or trade without insurance, while others are forced out of existence on a daily basis because of high insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">One encouraging note is that the number of cases appears to be on the decline. Some local authorities such as Tralee Urban Council, for example, named those who had brought successful claims against them. As a result, the number of claims in Tralee has reduced considerably. I believe a more universal application of that approach would result in a similar reduction in other areas. I note from a recent report in a national newspaper that there has been a marked fall-off in the number of personal injuries cases initiated in the High Court and Circuit Court due to the increased focus on fraudulent claims. It also indicated that judges were becoming more circumspect and the campaign by the Insurance Federation of Ireland to rule out fraudulent claims was having a significant impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">When combined with the media spotlight on insurance costs, all of those factors are making people less inclined to take questionable legal actions. The experience in Tralee, of which I expect the Minister is aware, certainly had that impact. The general reduction in the number of claims being taken indicates that people are having second thoughts about taking claims, having regard to the fact that it is not as easy as before to be successful. At a recent conference, a solicitor pointed out that there were over 19,000 High Court cases in 2001 and approximately 80% of all writs related to personal injury cases. By 2002, the number of High Court writs was down to 16,400 and, up to November of this year, there were just 12,253 writs. It is very unlikely that there will be another 4,000 by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Clearly, therefore, the number of writs has been considerably reduced already. That can be attributed to the reasons to which I have referred. It indicates that people are becoming less litigious and I believe that, in many instances, solicitors are probably not encouraging people to take that route.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I wish to mention a few concerns which members of the legal profession have brought to my attention and to which I hope the Minister will respond. The general impression is that the reforms she has proposed are being resisted by the legal profession – that is not an understatement. It is being said that such resistance is due to the negative impact of the reforms on the earnings of the legal profession. However, I believe members of that profession are genuinely concerned about the balance of rights as between individuals and insurance companies and are concerned that this Bill may not provide that balance. I believe the legal profession would welcome a Bill which would deal fairly and properly with the fraudulently exaggerated elements of "compo" culture in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The PIAB Bill has to be read in conjunction with the proposed new civil liability and courts Bill, only the heads of which have been published at this stage. That Bill is specifically designed to tackle exaggerated and fraudulent claims. Both of those Bills should be taken together, in a balanced way, to ensure a fair balance between genuine plaintiffs and the insurance industry. The concerns I have mentioned will, no doubt, be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">A further concern has been expressed about difficulties arising from the fact that the PIAB will not be bound to give any reasons for its decisions and it is not clear whether claimants will be provided with relevant documents submitted by insurance companies and will be allowed to comment on them. A further difficulty is that no reports will be issued to the media and the public will have no means of judging the operation of the board, other than on the basis of statistics which, presumably, will be produced a year or two later. I ask the Minister to address that issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_83">I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Department officials on the work which has gone into the production of this Bill. This may not have been the easiest of Bills to put together and it occurs to me that it may have involved jumping through some legislative hoops to get it all to fit together. However, the end product is a definite triumph, not just for the Minister's commitment but also with regard to the promises made by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Clearly, significant benefits will come from this Bill which will have far-reaching implications for everybody, young and old. It may well prove to be one of the most significant Bills to have passed through the Oireachtas since the formation of this Government in June 2002. All of us are aware of serious concerns throughout the country with regard to the cost of insurance. Those concerns have been well set out already in this debate and I do not need to repeat them.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The issues dealt with in this Bill are far-ranging and complex. It is to this Government's credit that it has put them together in such a cohesive manner in such a short space of time. Despite some criticism last night to the effect that the Bill has been in preparation since the former Deputy Des O'Malley was the Minister dealing with it, I am quite pleased that so much work has been done so quickly. It would not have been surprising if it had taken longer to put this Bill together, but we have been able to produce the finished product in a relatively short period of time. The Government's commitments and promises are being delivered in this area in terms of reducing the price of insurance. That is precisely what this Bill and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will do. Not only will it put a stop to the problem of rising insurance costs, but Irish consumers should see their premiums reduced in the very near future, which can only be described as a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">As Members are aware, the cost of insurance is a very definite problem. Businesses which are struggling to keep their costs low and maintain their competitiveness are seriously affected by the problem of high insurance prices. Those of us in the business sector are well aware of the significant increase in overhead costs, the feeling that the situation is out of control and the concern that there is relatively little return. Drivers are having to pay huge sums simply to get on the road. In some cases, these sums are even discouraging people from paying their car insurance, as indicated by court reports – an action which is, of course, illegal. The high cost of insurance is a problem which affects everybody. That is the reason the solution offered by this Bill is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Putting the PIAB in place is an essential first step to solving this problem. Once that has been achieved, we should see the situation alter dramatically in the very near future. By assessing compensation claims in an efficient and consistent manner, this board will significantly reduce the cost of claims. As we have so often been told by the insurance companies, it is the cost of claims that has driven up insurance costs. Accordingly, it is only logical that once the cost of claims comes down, the price of insurance should follow suit. The insurance companies will no longer be able to claim that it is the cost of litigation that is driving up premiums. In most cases, litigation costs should no longer be a factor in the situation. We were told that legal bills were adding 40% to the cost of insurance. If the cost of claims is reduced by most of that 40%, it is only right that the cost of premiums should also be reduced correspondingly. It is a simple formula. As the cost of compensation decreases, the cost of insurance should also decrease. Cutting the cost of compensation is precisely what this Bill will do by streamlining the process. Questions will have to be asked if we do not see reductions in insurance premiums close to the amount envisaged.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_94">I am pleased to congratulate the Tánaiste on recognising and being prepared to address the difficulties ahead. Given that it takes six times as long to commence the negotiations on claims as it does in Britain, it is obvious that we need to address that delay. The Bill will have an impact in that regard. The operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will allow for a shortening of the compensation process and that should go a long way towards reducing overhead costs. When the board is established, I hope that disgraceful statistic will no longer represent the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">The Government is playing its part to reduce the cost of insurance throughout society, not only through the introduction of this Bill but through the successful implementation of the penalty points system, which has already significantly contributed to cutting down the number of deaths on our roads. I am pleased to note that the Government will introduce the civil liability and courts Bill, which should help further to speed up the litigation process and to cut significantly the number of false claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The ball is definitely back in the court of the insurance companies. Lowering prices will be their responsibility and the field has been cleared for that. That is the least they owe to the people who have subscribed to their companies by way of insurance premia over the years. The current level of insurance costs is not acceptable. The high cost of insurance is affecting our competitiveness and putting jobs at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The cost of commercial liability insurance cover is estimated at €2 billion annually. Insurance companies cannot be allowed simply to convert their savings into extra profits. It is important that pressure is maintained to ensure they reduce their prices to a fair level rather than squeeze every last cent from policy holders. They have a responsiblity not only to business people but to other citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">From running a small business, I am aware of the exorbitant cost of public liability insurance, the importance of ensuring that one always has such cover and the continuing concern of ensuring that one is well covered. Insurance companies continue to cream profits at the expense of citizens and the State. I expect insurance companies will begin to tell us again that the cost of insurance has decreased. They quoted a figure of 20% in that regard in the past eight or nine months, but they always fail to mention that insurance premia have increased by 150% during the past year or 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">It will also be interesting to observe how insurance companies can continue to justify the exorbitant prices they charge young motorists for cover. The cost of their premiums should also significantly decrease following the enactment of this legisation. Coming from a midland county, I am aware of the number of young people who regularly complain about the high cost of motor insurance. Many of them make the point that they cannot afford to pay the premiums. This causes them great inconvenience in getting to and from their places of work and study. The cost of motor insurance is causing many young people to move from County Laois to live in the capital. Others have been forced into a corner and they have no choice but to pay the premium. The insurance companies apparently continue to ignore young people's legitimate concern about high insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Members have met many deputations and, on their behalf, have brought forward concerns about the difficulties facing young people in getting to their places of work or study and pointed out that for them a car is a neccessity. Even though many people have cars, they have to put aside a great part of their salary to enable them to travel to work, and the largest segment of that cost is the insurance premium. These problems need to be addressd soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Insurance companies and the Irish Insurance Federation must ensure a reduction in premium costs across all insurance sectors. It is up to them to accept their responsiblity in tackling the threat posed to our competitiveness by the high cost of insurance. It is important they should recognise that. They need to ensure that premiums are reduced and maintain them at a reasonable level. If they do not achieve that, the threat to our competitiveness will put jobs at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I hope insurance companies will avail of the opportunity afforded by the Bill to reduce the premia they charge before the Government is forced to take further action. A token reduction in premia will not be enough and, if one is offered, the nonsense of insurance companies claiming they are working with Government will be seen through. A wholesale reduction in premiums should be made immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this legislation, which delivers on one of the many promises she has made. I welcome the Bill and I look forward to the postive outcomes that will emerge from its enactment.</p>

          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_104">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. It has been obvious for some time that the cost of obtaining insurance, of whatever type, has rocketed. Constituents, in a personal capacity or as representatives of their own businesses, have repeatedly told of enormous increases in the premium levels compared to a few years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">How often have Members heard motorists, especially young motorists, tell of how much they have been quoted for car insurance? Recently a young man, with a clean driving record, told me he had received a quote in excess of €5,000 for car insurance. The point must be made that it is young people living in rural Ireland who are most dependent on cars for transport to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Despite all the diffiicluties of living in Dublin, with the major infrastructural works currently in process, there is still a public transport system in place and it is operating well. DART, taxis and buses are all readily available. Contrast that with the position of a young man or women living in rural Ireland, whose place of employment may be 20 or 30 miles from where he or she lives, yet the only form of transport is either a car or bus and, unfortunately, buses only run between the major centres of population. For many young people in rural Ireland, it is an economic necessity to have a car, yet with the increasing levels of insurance premiums being sought by the motor insurance companies, more and more young people cannot afford it. This is having a devastating effect on the economic life of rural Ireland, to say nothing of the blight on the social fabric.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Motor insurance is only one aspect of the increasing cost of insurance. Public liability insurance and employer's liablity insurance are two other areas where problems arise. In Sligo, there are many instances where community facilities, such as playgrounds, cannot be built or operated because of the horrendous cost of insurance that the community would have to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Government, in An Agreed Programme for Government published in June 2002, gave a commitment that there would be a fundamental reform of the insurance market. Much work has gone on since then and today we are seeing the first fruits of that reform in the form of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The costs insurance are multifactorial, but without doubt the huge increase in personal injury claims associated with the horrendous costs of litigation have contributed in no small way. Our legal system is adversarially based and, as a result, a large element of any claim settled is absorbed in legal fees. It has been estimated that as much as 30% to 40% of any claim is due to the legal element.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will operate from a completely different basis. Instead of being adversarial it will be inquisitorial. This system is already in place in the United Kingdom and has seen a dramatic fall in the number of cases of personal injury that go to court. A book of quantum will be prepared and published, which will operate as a guideline for damages that may be paid for various categories of injuries. I believe strongly that it is necessary for this list of injury payments to be published in advance of the board starting to adjudicate on claims. There must be some allowance for similar injuries which occur in different situations to be taken into account. For example, a health young man with uncomplicated leg fracture may take a much shorter time to recover than a 55 year old with similar injury.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Will the Minister clarify the provisions in the Bill regarding oral hearings? These will not be considered or conducted by the board. All the board's deliberations will be based on submitted evidence of injury in a medical report. Since most claimants will do so only once and since the defendants – the insurance industry – will be constantly involved in this process, it is important that the rights of the claimant are fully protected. It must not develop into a David versus Goliath situation and, in that regard, the medical report is all important. To help claimants have as much of a level playing field as possible, the board should issue the claimant with a detailed letter outlining the necessity for a comprehensive medical report, including x-rays and other tests needed. It is not fair on any individual to expect them to submit professional documents to support their case without good guidelines when the defendants have the full weight of their medical and legal experts preparing their documents behind them.</p>

          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_113">I say this not in opposition to this timely Bill, which I warmly welcome, but in defence of the rights of the ordinary man and women who will, in most cases, be submitting his or her case to the board for the first and, hopefully, the only time.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">This Bill is part and parcel of a comprehensive insurance reform package and is closely linked with the civil liability and courts Bill which is due to come before the House. The requirement to notify a claim within two months of the injury is too short a time, particularly in cases of more serious injury. I will illustrate this point with a case with which I am personally familiar. A young man sustained horrific injuries in an accident, through no fault of his own. He spent three months in hospital and a further period learning to walk again. During this time, he resolutely focused on his recovery and did not entertain any idea of not returning to his previous employment. His employers were supportive of him and kept his job open. Two and a half years after his accident, it became apparent that he would not be able to return to work which initiated the onset of severe depression. Legal proceedings then ensued and his case was settled, amicably, for €500,000. For the first year after his accident, this young man was not focused on litigation or injury claims but recovery. This highlights how a time limit of two months for submitting a claim to the board is too short. I ask the Minister to consider extending the limit to one or even two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Likewise, once a claim is made, the board is not under a time constraint to publish its findings. In the interests of fairness and transparency, the PIAB should be obliged to issue its findings within a specified timeframe, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so, such as if a claimant's medical condition has not fully responded in that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">There is the issue of who should provide the medical report in claims. In the Seanad, there was some discussion as to whether it should be registered medical practitioners or others. The ideal person to issue the medical report on behalf of the claimant is the family doctor, as he or she knows the person in his or her entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">I welcome the Bill and commend the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, for her great work on insurance reform. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_118">I must begin with a declaration of interest. <i>Mea culpa,</i> I am a lawyer. That puts me to the back of the temple of public opinion. As a politician-lawyer, it puts me outside the door altogether. However, my declaration is one of non-interest because I am now a legal consultant and not involved in active practice. If this Bill impacts on lawyers' incomes, it does not matter a toss to me. I am looking at how this Bill will impact on the many thousands of accident victims. The danger is that the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, through this Bill, will trample on the constitutional rights of accident victims, unless it is amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Article 34 of the Constitution prescribes that justice must be administered in courts established by law, by judges appointed under the Constitution and, in general, must be administered in public. There are specific provisions that allow the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature by people who are not judges. However, the exercise of such powers must be in accordance with the principles of natural justice and fair procedures. Under the Bill, injured claimants will now be obliged to present their claims personally to the proposed board, which will operate in secret and deny them the right to independent advice, assistance or representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The Bill makes provision for vulnerable parties, but these are wholly inadequate. The claim, therefore, that the PIAB's priority will be to implement fair procedures in accordance with the principles of natural justice is wholly without merit. On this score, methinks the Tánaiste doth protest too much, though she understands my point on this. I have no doubt that the approach adopted in the Bill will lead to constitutional challenges, particularly in cases where amounts are accepted without any independent advice or assistance, only to be found inadequate at a later stage. Where will this leave the board and the claimant? The intransigence of the Minister in accepting the argument for reasonable amendments will affect what could be a decent Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The second flaw in the Bill is of a more practical nature. The establishment of the PIAB is unlikely to lead to substantial reductions in insurance premia. Last year, with the establishment of an interim board, in a headline article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> the Minister stated there would be a 31% decrease in insurance costs. However, the latest target reduction from the insurance industry is far below that figure. The chief executive of the Irish Insurance Federation, Mr. Michael Kemp, stated the reduction will be 7.6% when he was giving evidence to an Oireachtas committee. There is no guarantee of any significant reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Some commentators suggest that the PIAB will add another unnecessary layer of expensive bureaucracy to the system and lead to an increase in insurance costs. I do not believe that will happen. However, the Des Peelo report suggested it could. The Minister has refused to countenance an independent cost benefit analysis of the entire process. The jury is still out on this issue. On balance, the Bill, if amended to ensure that the legal and constitutional rights of genuine claimants are not restricted, will not do any harm and might even do some good, particularly with small claims. However, if the Government persists in bulldozing the Bill through unattended, it will be demonstrating that it is in the pockets of big business and the insurance companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I have drawn blood. I want the Bill amended to ensure that victims can be in the same position as insurance companies, not in the David and Goliath position as referred to by Deputy Devins.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Lawyers, the Progressive Democrats, the insurance lobby, big business and medical consultants represent vested interests. For example, changes should be made to the way medical consultants operate. Given their 30 hour per week public service contract and huge private incomes, changes have been indicated. However, this does not mean that, if I have a serious illness, I should be prevented from or penalised for going to a consultant. The first action I would take is to go to a consultant.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">However, this is what is happening in this case. Effectively lawyers are being excluded from the stage. While this may cost lawyers some money, in many instances it will effectively cost claimants considerably more. This Bill is presented in such a way as to indicate that claimants will get the full amount of their entitlements through this board. Who is to say what is the full amount? Who is to advise them? Where is the independent advice? Who represents the victim in all this? There is no such representation on the interim board that has been established. Big business is represented by the chairperson, Dorothea Dowling. IBEC is also represented.</p>

Insurance companies will have their in-house lawyers, external lawyers, medical consultants, actuaries and engineers. No expense will be spared as far as they are concerned.

Six years later that unfortunate person had to come to me to try to find a way for her claim to be processed. The Bill is formulated in the same way. No time limit is involved.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_199">I am telling the Minister that there is a problem with the time limit, in particular where the respondent is entitled, having decided not to pay the award, to raise the liability issue again. That is a huge problem in so far as the time limit is concerned. The evidence may not be available to the claimant or his or her advisers in going to court from the point of view of proving liability at that stage. It is another huge difficulty with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I mentioned the diminishing expectations as regards reductions in premiums. It is ironic that already there is a reduction in premiums, apart from any Government action, particularly on the road traffic side. This has nothing to do with Government action. It is occurring long before this Bill will become operational. We have not seen it on the employers' liability side as yet, but it is already in existence, partly because of the law of diminishing returns. With insurance premiums going up by as much as 300% over a number of years the insurance companies found that the law of diminishing returns was taking effect. The other main reason given to me for the reduction in premiums is that judges never crossed the euro bridge. Where they awarded £100,000 in the past they now give €100,000. That, in effect, is a reduction of 20% in awards. Other factors such as the abolition of no foal, no fee advertising have contributed, but the figures show a reduction in the number of writs issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I saw an article written by solicitor Emer Gilvarry the other day in which she quoted that the figure for the High Court where 80% of cases relate to personal injuries is down from over 19,000 in 2001 to 16,400 in 2002 and is likely to be less than 15,000 in the current year. That shows there is already a reduction in that area. It has nothing to do with the PIAB or any Government action.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">If pressure can be put on the insurance companies, that is great. I have no confidence, however, that the insurance companies will react to the formation of this board by reducing their premiums. I come back to the basic point, if savings are to be made, they will be achieved at the expense of claimants because of the way this Bill is structured. That is wrong. I would be happy with the Bill if that was not the outcome. I have no problem about savings on the legal front. However, the imposition of a <i>de facto</i> inequality between the claimant and the insurance company is unjust and wrong. That is being achieved by effectively ensuring as far as possible that the claimant does not have independent legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I accept that under the Bill there is no prohibition on getting legal advice – the contrary is the case – but it will be at the expense of the claimant. That is contrary to the existing system and in net terms it means that the amount received by the claimant will be less than he or she is properly and fully entitled to. That is the fatal defect in this Bill. If the Minister had an open mind on this issue it would be possible to improve the Bill without unduly increasing the cost. It would turn a Bill that is unjust and unfair into a good Bill. I am concerned that the Minister has refused at all times to maintain an open mind as regards this Bill and to accept reasoned amendment. If that attitude persists we will end up with a Bill that will not achieve the desired purpose and could result in substantial inequity and injustice in so far as claimants are concerned.</p>

          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_206">I welcome the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003. For a long time improvements have been sought in this area within this House and indeed outside. Our constituents make the case strongly to us that there is need for an insurance reform programme. This Bill constitutes an important element of that. I think virtually everyone will have been surprised by the findings in the report that litigation costs account for in excess of 40% in cases of this nature. High insurance costs threaten jobs, particularly in the case of small manufacturers who are charged extraordinary premiums, some of which have risen by as much as 400% over the past five or six years. It threatens competitiveness, which in general has been tackled successfully by industry and the Government. However, this is one of the areas where it has been difficult to maintain competitiveness. Ultimately it threatens the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Concerns have been expressed on behalf of the legal fraternity. Given that 40% of compensation has gone to lawyers heretofore, there are, clearly, income and employment implications. No one should be surprised at lawyers seeking to defend their patch in this regard. However, we could as a nation, employ our legal resources much better. The cost of training a solicitor or barrister is substantial and is borne in great part by the State. The need for much stricter regulation and better practice within a plethora of agencies and areas of public and private enterprise has been indicated in recent times. It is something that could be fruitfully examined. The concept of an alternative to the courts system has been considered over decades. The view has been expressed in this Chamber and elsewhere that there were substantial legal and constitutional obstacles – some of them were outlined by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The principal obstacles have been successfully addressed in this legislation. Besides the surprise that more than 40% of the cost of cases goes to the legal profession, people are also somewhat taken aback that less than 10% of cases eventually find their way into the courts. Despite that, in excess of 70% of cases involve barristers, as against 4% in England. That is a considerable surprise for anyone who looks at this area for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The provision in section 44 seems to provide for an interim payment to cover medical and other expenses. It is not clear how it is meant to operate. From the way it is written it is implied that the PIAB has the right to make a charge against the respondent. In a great many cases, however, medical expenses and bank overdraft costs, due to unavoidable expenditure in replacement labour costs or whatever, are major considerations. Currently there are enormous delays and there will still be hold-ups as people await medical reports etc. It is hugely important that the legislation sets out the right of access to an interim payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Section 3 provides that the PIAB will start with employers' liability claims. I am not sure how it then progresses to public liability and motor accident claims. Perhaps the Minister will explain that. Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of insurance costs for schools. That is something that, I believe, has been raised with all Deputies, as indeed has the issue regarding voluntary and sporting organisations. My fellow principals frequently complained that claims were made which they considered spurious in some instances, only to discover some considerable time later that the claim had been settled by the insurance companies without the school authorities being informed. This caused extreme anger in cases where school staff believed the claim would not have been sustainable in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Certain action could be beneficial in this area. For example, the vast majority of parents of children attending schools would be perfectly happy with a system which met basic medical costs only. Very often these are not provided for and parents sometimes have a genuine complaint that no effort has been made to meet medical expenses arising from accidents. It is worth examining a formal system for meeting basic, genuine medical expenses, to which people would sign up and be bound. Arising from such a system, it would be essential to require insurance premiums to reflect the drastically reduced exposure of schools to claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The Independent Insurance Company entered the Irish market some years ago on foot of European Union regulations allowing outside companies to enter other markets. The company collected millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of pounds in the pre-euro days in this market. When it subsequently collapsed, its United Kingdom clients were indemnified, whereas customers here who had paid full insurance premiums had to pay the cost of ongoing claims or, in some cases, went out of business because they could not afford to pay them. This also meant that claimants incurred losses because no redress was available to them when the company collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">If we want competition in the market – EU regulations already allow companies to enter the market – at minimum we must regulate insurance companies and provide a safety net in the event that such circumstances arise again. To the best of my knowledge, the position today is as pertained when the Independent Insurance Company collapsed. During the Presidency we will have an opportunity to insist that proper EU regulation and control is enforced to cover circumstances in which companies from one member state enter markets in other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Nearly every Deputy will have been approached by young drivers who find the cost of motor insurance a major burden, especially if they need a car to get to work which is often the case, specifically in rural areas. We must acknowledge that considerable progress has been made in this area in the past year or thereabouts, but only on foot of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report published in 2001. Insurance companies have begun to look at initiatives to reduce costs, such as on passing the driving test or, in the case of one company, successful completion of special training. In the latter case, drivers receive a considerable decrease in their insurance premium.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The establishment of the PIAB arises from a commitment in the programme for Government. Its role is confined to claims in which legal issues are not disputed. I presume in the case of the respondent, the insurance company, this judgment will be made on foot of legal advice. I hope it will not become a mechanism to facilitate fraudulent claims, with insurance companies regarding the PIAB route as the cheapest option, regardless of liability. This would be similar to the experience I have just outlined with regard to schools. I am not certain this possibility is balanced by forcing the companies, once they have accepted liability before the PIAB, to subsequently accept liability in the court – if my reading of the Bill is correct, the opposite is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I welcome the provision which allows the PIAB to protect vulnerable claimants. While the <i>modus operandi</i>is again not clear, it is an important provision. The provision in section 7 to allow claimants the right to employ legal advice is important and addresses the potential difficulties outlined by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_217">I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this Bill, which is, in some respects, long overdue. One wonders at times why it is has taken so long to introduce this legislation and, in this respect, I pay tribute to the Minister and the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, for the determined manner with which they grasped and pursued this issue. The House should also compliment the Chairman and members of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business for the recent wide-ranging debate they have managed to promote on the insurance issue. One cannot allow the occasion pass without paying a deserved tribute to Dr. Dorothea Dowling for her almost missionary zeal in pursuing this agenda. I am sure she will not rest until all the recommendations in all the relevant reports have been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">There is no doubt that we have been bedevilled in recent years by what is known colloquially as the compo culture. Those of us who have served on local authorities have experienced at first hand the cost such claims impose on local authorities. The Bill, although it is only a beginning in that it is confined to employers' liability, is nevertheless wide-ranging. The two local authorities Deputies know best are Dublin City Council, on which Deputy Finian McGrath and I have served, and Fingal County Council. While checking the figures, I found that to the end of October this year, Dublin City Council had paid out €6.078 million to settle 722 claims. In 2002, it settled 1,358 claims at a cost of €8.51 million and, while not comparing like with like because of an issue which arose with regard to taxis, in 2001 the city council settled 1,713 claims at a cost of €7.9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Similarly, this year, to the end of October, 234 claims have cost Fingal County Council €1.75 million. In 2002, the cost to the council of 437 claims was €1.2 million, while the equivalent figures for 2001 were 401 and €1.5 million. The amount of money spent on settling claims has been extraordinary. We should consider playgrounds, community centres, swimming pools and footpaths which could have been provided if we did not have to pay such phenomenal costs. A few years ago, 60% of all claims against local authorities were related to flooding in flats or damage to property, for example, collapsed roofs and so forth, while 40% were personal injuries claims. The reverse is now the case, with 60% of claims being for personal injuries and 40% related to property.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">To be fair to the public utilities in Dublin, they have tried reasonably successfully to co-ordinate their approach and have managed to ward off some of the more determined litigants, although they are still paying catch-up. It is for this reason that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will bring renewed coherence and cohesion to the insurance and claims issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Deputy Killeen mentioned the cost of insurance to schools. Some Deputies have had first-hand experience of the enormous costs to schools of settling claims. Another issue that needs to be examined is that all schools are insured by one insurance company. As a former vice-principal of a school who was at the receiving end of letters making claims, my experience is that this company would settle in nine out of ten cases without reference to the school. The income of many schools in disadvantaged areas where enrolments are dropping and costs are extremely high has been almost exhausted by the cost of insurance settlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Small businesses are in a similar position and, unfortunately, we are all aware of many small builders, shopkeepers and so forth who can no longer afford the cost of exorbitant insurance premiums. The most recent group to have been in touch with me includes organisers of youth organisations and sports clubs. The costs are such that it is almost impossible for football clubs, sports clubs and youth clubs to function. No one is taking any risks. It is almost unheard of that anything other than the absolute number of people who are supposed to travel in a minibus will be allowed to do so. In Dublin city we have long since abandoned the development of adventure playgrounds because of the inability of the local authority to obtain insurance cover. We have all been criticised by the skateboard fraternity for not facilitating it. Even the private sector has been unable to provide sufficient insurance cover for these people as a result of the high cost of litigation. We have all heard from the insurance industry about the costs it has incurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Another group with whom many of us in the city have had contact, including I am sure the Minister, are taxi and hackney drivers. This sector appears to be crucified by the insurance industry. A small accident can result in their premiums being increased by anything up to 300% or 400%, without any reference to the drivers or owners of the plate. I know a number of drivers who have gone out of business and onto the unemployment register because of the high cost of insurance. It is for that reason I welcome the Bill. I welcome the book of quantum. This exists informally in local authorities at present. The fact that 40% of the costs in these settlements are legal costs highlights the need for this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I am concerned about people who have a problem with form filling. Many people who genuinely do not seek huge amounts of compensation find it difficult to fill out forms because of literacy and other problems. No matter how user-friendly companies are, people should not be told they can get the form on the website. We are not all computer literate, particularly elderly people. The other issue that must be borne in mind is the danger of what used to be ambulance-chasing solicitors now becoming the new generation of consultants assisting, at no small charge, in filling out these forms. This has happened in recent weeks in regard to the sports capital programme. Some of us will have received letters from people advertising their services helping community groups to fill out application forms for a sports capital grant. One of the fees being charged amounted to a modest €1,500, which would pauperise a club. Imagine the difficulties this would create for individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Another aspect is the cost of medical letters. The cost of a medical letter can amount to anything up to €250. Equally, one can no longer walk into a doctor's surgery and expect to be provided with a letter. I have been approached by people who have been waiting for three weeks to two months for a letter. If one goes to a reputable consultant, one could wait for at least that length, if not longer. These areas must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">As other Deputies said, the overall objective of the Bill ought to be a reduction in insurance costs across the board. There is anecdotal evidence that there is a tendency towards a reduction in insurance premiums so far. However, it needs to be pursued with vigour. I would welcome a greater degree of compulsion on insurance companies to pass on reductions to customers because we have all been involved in trying to help young motorcyclists and others who find the cost of insurance prohibitive. We must pay tribute to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, for his tenacity in pursuing the penalty points system. It is making a difference but all insurance companies do not appear to believe they ought to reduce their premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I do not expect insurance companies to act as charities or to exist entirely for the benefit of the community. However, they make enormous profits. The profits in this country are completely out of line with the level of profits elsewhere. I would welcome greater competition in the insurance industry. I would also welcome the introduction of any mechanism to drive down the cost of insurance. I am sure the PIAB will contribute towards this.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I welcome the proposal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce the civil liability and courts Bill to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims. Certainly there is some evidence that this is happening. I was heartened in my discussions with some officials in Dublin City Council who have managed through co-operating with the other public utilities to drive down the numbers of claims made. Between a quarter and one third of claims made against Dublin City Council do not relate to the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">There is another aspect which might be examined. I am referring to an initiative similar to that introduced by the Mayor of New York, namely, a call centre for reporting false claims against public utilities. I am aware that Dublin City Council is considering this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I welcome the Bill and look forward to its early enactment.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I am sure all of us would welcome any measure which seeks to introduce a fairer system in regard to insurance and, as a consequence, possibly a cheaper system. There are times when Irish society appears not just to be polarised but gridlocked. One of the key issues for this economy is competition and regulatory policy. These are crucial issues in a modern economy to stop the kind of rip-off practices many consumers and small business people experience in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">There are powerful vested interests involved in insurance. As Deputy Carey pointed out, the insurance companies make enormous profits. These profits are not always transparently assessable because of the complicated nature of the insurance companies' accounts, but they have done very well. The other vested interests are lawyers and, more recently to an increasing extent, doctors who act as expert witnesses in insurance cases. Approximately 40% of all insurance claim costs relate to professional fees, mostly lawyers and professional witnesses' fees. These people have fine homes in Dublin, and second and third homes in this country and outside the jurisdiction, which were obtained on the back of the "compo" culture. In this regard one often thinks of an individual, perhaps on a low income, who has pursued an inflated or fraudulent claim. Such people, however, have willing partners assisting them to make claims in the legal and, sometimes, the medical profession. It is important that we acknowledge this.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Consumers and small business people operate in an environment which is often unregulated and very expensive and when something goes wrong they are often left with no recourse. Insurance companies have grown fat on premia, as have lawyers, and this has developed our claims industry. The consumer of insurance services, whether the individual householder or a business owner, are to be pitied given the sky-high level of premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">All Deputies can give examples of businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones, which have been almost driven to the wall because of the unbelievable level of inflation in insurance costs. A successful small video company in my constituency had hopes of expanding but its insurance premium increased by some 4,000% in one year. Inevitably, its expansion plans had to be put on hold and, in order to limit the amount of insurance it had to pay, it let go one of the company's five employees. Every Deputy could repeat such a story.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Another major problem is the discrimination against young male drivers. We know that young male drivers, particularly late at night if they have been drinking, are a danger to themselves and other road users. Nonetheless, not every young man is an irresponsible driver or drinker. Due to the dispersed nature of housing development, most young men need transport, especially those who operate as carpenters, plumbers, mechanics and so on. They need to be able to drive and to have a clear insurance certificate. Many parents pay extraordinarily high insurance costs to allow young people to drive, especially their sons. This is essential from a business point of view because of our limited public transport services. All other European countries provide adequate public transport in towns and cities, especially trains, from early morning to late at night. This is not an option here because of the appallingly poor transport system we have developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">There is also a growing insurance problem for schools and community centres. Once they engage in dialogue with insurers about any kind of activity, whether it is a political meeting or a leisure activity for children, the cost per head for insurance becomes extraordinarily high. It costs an additional premium of up to €100 to cover some community centres in my constituency for the potential insurance liability of holding a political meeting. Many people operate without insurance. They chose to become self-insured because they cannot support the cost burden it imposes on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Deputy Carey referred to local councils in Dublin. I was elected to Dublin County Council in 1991. One of the first issues I raised in that forum was the lack of children's playgrounds. At that time, a case had been taken by a journalist who rode a bike in an area of a park reserved for children. His claim against Dublin County Council was successful. As a result, the children of Dublin city and the new county council areas of South Dublin, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal have been unable to establish local neighbourhood playgrounds due to high insurance costs based on potential claims. Today's initiative will not address that difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Many people – including members of the Government who have been in office for the past seven years – have chosen not to address the issue of children's playgrounds in urban areas. It suits them to say they cannot do it for reasons of insurance. It also suits public officials to blame a lack of initiative in many areas on the high cost of insurance. A strong case exists for a constitutional amendment to redefine reasonable duties of care and the balance between a reasonable exercise of care by a local authority or another public body and the requirement of individuals not to be grossly negligent in their use of public facilities. This is particularly an issue for the farming community in the context of strangers accessing farm land.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">What has happened in the insurance industry has had a tremendously negative effect on many areas of life. The economic argument in regard to loss of competitiveness, higher prices and the rip-off involved in insurance costs, are the key economic ones. However, we have not sufficiently counted the cost in terms of quality of life, the effects of insurance industry practices and the lack of Government action thereon. This extends to children not having access to playgrounds or having the freedom to run around and, perhaps, risk some slight injury in the rough and tumble of play. In many schools, traditional play is severely curtailed by teachers because of the insurance risk involved due to a lack of definition of the exercise of reasonable care and personal negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Why has this modest initiative taken the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, seven years? I heard her speak on the "Marian Finucane" show earlier in the week. She said she did not want to leave her current ministry until she had pushed the PIAB reform through, as though it was some great reform. I remind her that, when the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, was Minister of State in the same Department, he drew up a prototype for this legislation which was signed off and ready for implementation.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">It was the Labour Party's experience that the insurance companies mounted an enormous lobby a number of years ago to get rid of jury trials in cases involving compensation. The Deputies opposite will remember we were told that, if non-jury trials were introduced, the process would be speedier and more efficient as there would be less requirement for lawyers. Despite the fact that juries disappeared, the lawyers multiplied like the loaves and fishes until we found ourselves in the ridiculous circumstances of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Members on all sides have pointed out a number of critical issues in respect of making applications to the new board. There is a draft document on applications which is supposed to be user friendly. Everybody knows this is a legal area and that lawyers will be leaning over people's shoulders offering to rescue the poor individual who cannot fill in a form. It is essential that the Minister and Minister of State do not restrict assessment of the document to their Department. It should be circulated to community centres to establish how easy it is for people with limited reading skills to read it.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">What is at issue is a huge change of culture. We want people who have relatively small claims to feel confident that the new board will deal fairly with them. If the board is not seen to deal fairly, speedily and resolutely with reasonable claims from its first day of operation, it will falter and people will turn to the lawyers. Even if it means waiting a considerable period, they will take their cases to a solicitor instead. The legal profession will be only too happy to accommodate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Inevitably, there will be cases in which the medical damage resulting from an accident is not immediately apparent. It will be necessary for the board to promote a culture of fairness through its mission statement. The parties on both sides in the case of a claim must have confidence that the board will deal fairly with them. The publication of the book of quantum is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We must ensure from now on that where is a defect in public property, a fire-brigade method of addressing it as rapidly as possible is in place. Every Member of this House can refer to instances of collapsed walls. In my constituency, a wall adjoining a cemetery was knocked down by the cemetery JCB. The rest of the wall may now be unstable. It can take weeks to get the council to attend to a problem. If there is an injury to a child or adult in the meantime, who will be liable? Both sides of the wall are public property in one way or another. We must have a rapid reaction to defects in public property which, if they injure people, will certainly give rise to claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">An issue which was never tackled when Senator O'Rourke was the Minister dealing with the privatisation of Eircom was the right of the succeeding generation of utility companies to dig up the roads as often as they wished without co-ordination. We still have to tie this down because it is a significant cause of accidents in the Dublin area. There is a serious lack of regulations on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">My colleague, Deputy Pat Carey, specifically referred, in the context of the insurance debate, to the need for skateboard facilities. Everyone in the region understands the case he has made. I have been campaigning in the Tallaght area for a skateboard facility which is badly needed. The initiative came to me from a group of young people in Killinarden in Tallaght and it is important that we support them. I have worked to persuade South Dublin County Council to bring forward proposals for a skateboard facility. We have been hampered hugely by the insurance industry. I noticed the capital sports grant advertisements over the previous weekend. That is to the great credit of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. I will be calling on South Dublin County Council to make a meaningful application to ensure that a skateboard facility is provided for the young people in my community.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Since my election to this House to represent the people of Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue, I have, like my colleagues, supported the Government's actions to ensure the cost of insurance is reduced. It must be brought down from the unsustainably high levels which have closed businesses, cost jobs and increased the number of uninsured drivers on our roads. On many occasions businessmen, young people and parents have come to my weekly clinics to make their frustrations known.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The Government's response to this issue has been speedy and co-ordinated. A range of measures have been or will be introduced. These include the penalty points introduced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, greater enforcement by gardaí, the insurance industry's fraud report line, the impending civil liability and courts Bill from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, which includes a number of measures to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims within the courts system, and this Bill from the Tánaiste which provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of the body to be known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The establishment of the PIAB is a key part of the Government's insurance reform programme. Its objective to tackle the delivery costs of speedier compensation to genuine claimants while reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses is welcome and should be supported. I have always admired the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and I hope he takes note of this view.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Within the insurance industry litigation costs can be in excess of 40% of the cost of compensation claims. One has only to read the papers to appreciate the level of legal costs incurred in the tribunal industry. Legal costs have contributed to the high cost of insurance and to the cost of claims against the growing self-insured sector, especially the State. The media tell that story well.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The increase in insurance costs is a threat to our economy, job security and the country's competitive edge in the European and world marketplace. I support the basis of the Bill whereby, by eliminating the need for litigation costs where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivery of compensation to the benefit of all consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will offer a lower cost and speedier means of finalising genuine personal injury claims than the current litigation system. I welcome that the board will commence operation early in the new year with employers' liability claims before encompassing public liability and motor accidents in mid-2004. The Tánaiste stated that, under the current legal system, fewer than 10% of claims reach an oral hearing in court. The 90% of claims settled without a trial are considered to carry an excessive litigation overhead. These figures must act as a major catalyst to the PIAB to assess compensation at current levels more quickly while eliminating the excessive litigation overhead.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">As Deputy Harney said, the PIAB is not being set up to reduce the level of awards to genuine claimants. It should give claimants confidence in the process to know that the PIAB will always communicate directly with claimants in order that they know how their cases are progressing through each stage of the assessment. I agree with the procedures to be adopted where assessment of general damages for pain and suffering will be based primarily on medical reports from the claimant's treating doctor. In some cases the claimant will be examined by a member of the independent medical panel established by the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">A book of quantum – I wish we did not choose to copy United Kingdom descriptions all the time – will be compiled and published as a guideline to general damages for various categories of injuries. Parties can use it to satisfy themselves as to the reasonableness of PIAB awards. The existence of the guide should also assist parties in reaching negotiated settlements without recourse to litigation. The existence of a similar book in England contributes to only 4% of cases involving barristers compared with their involvement in 70% of personal injury cases here.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">In contrast to the current adversarial system of personal injury litigation, the approach adopted by assessors in the PIAB will be of a different inquisition type and will result in the board getting to the facts of the extent of the allowable claim and ensuring the claimant gets that to which he or she is entitled, no more and no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The costs of the board will be covered by fees levied on respondents on a case by case basis, at a standard minimum rate plus any outlay incurred for expert opinion in more complex cases. These fees will be set with a view to the board breaking even financially. PIAB fees payable by insured defendants will be covered by their insurance policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Colleagues have shared information with regard to their areas. South Dublin County Council, based in Tallaght, informs me that 270 new claims were lodged with it this year while, over the past two years, 339 claims were settled, costing in excess of €2 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the Bill and support the work on vital issues which the PIAB will address. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I welcome the Bill to the House and commend the Government on its courage in bringing it to this stage. I congratulate the Tánaiste, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, on the great work they have done in addressing the serious issue of the insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I pay a special tribute to Deputy Treacy who, as former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, carried the can for this industry for a number of years. I had experience as Leader of the Seanad of the difficulties he experienced at the time. I remember the day he appointed Dorothea Dowling, which was probably one of the best decisions he made as a Minister of State. The 750 page report of the MIAB, which she chaired voluntarily for five years, speaks for itself. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business endorsed that report <i>en bloc.</i>Nobody could have done so much work or been more committed in a voluntary capacity than Dorothea Dowling and her committee. I look forward with confidence to her being chair of this new board, the PIAB, and to its speedy implementation. We are fortunate to have Ms Dowling and I thank the Minister of State for his foresight in convincing her to take the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe contributed earlier and expressed various views. All fair-minded people would agree that, in the system being proposed, the claimant is awarded the party costs for the adversarial aspect. The claimant also pays the solicitors their day-to-day costs. The PIAB has an adversarial aspect where claimants can seek independent legal advice if they think they are in a position to get more. They will be responsible for their solicitors' costs. We often see examples of cases where this occurs in the media. In some cases it is alleged that legal people get percentages above their actual costs in cases where awards are won.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Whether on the Government or Opposition benches, we know the greatest challenge facing us in this area is employment in small family businesses and small and medium industry. These small and medium-sized family industries are the backbone of the country and have given us the Celtic tiger. The difficulty experienced by these businesses with insurance is an outrage. All of us who employ people know that after wage costs, the most expensive item on the expenditure sheet is insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has held 12 public hearings on the issue of insurance. Some 17 delegations from all sectors of the industry, such as brokers, the legal profession, customers and clients, attended the meetings. The committee was told that insurance charges have increased by between 100% and 350% in the past four years. The Government cannot stand by and allow the increases, which are neither acceptable nor sustainable, to continue. If this Bill had not been brought before the House to control the increases in insurance costs, tens of thousands of people would be laid off. It would be inconceivable to allow so many people to become unemployed. Great efforts have been made by this generation and previous generations. The insurance costs of some family businesses, which have been handed down over the decades and have track records that are second to none, are going through the roof. In that light, I commend the Government's efforts to bring this Bill before the House for its approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Deputy O'Connor has mentioned that just 4% of cases go to court in the UK, whereas 70% of them go to court in Ireland. Why does it take six times longer to get to court in Ireland than it does in other jurisdictions? The average compensation payment for a whiplash injury is €2,500 in the UK, but it is €10,000 in Ireland. Such statistics have been brought to the attention of the joint committee. Although 90% of motor insurance policyholders have been receiving a no claims bonus for ten years, 10% of their claims relate to uninsured vehicles. Some 80,000 uninsured vehicles are roaming around the country. Decent people who have a no claims bonus have to pay an additional 10% because others are driving without insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I have the great distinction of chairing the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. During the committee's insurance hearings, contributions were made by Deputies Callanan, Tony Dempsey, Hogan, Howlin, Conor Lenihan, Lynch, McHugh, Murphy, Nolan and Wilkinson – Deputy Wilkinson is present in the Chamber this afternoon. The Deputies worked with Senators Coghlan, Hanafin, Leyden and Ross. I commend the consultants who assisted the committee in preparing its interim report in a record time of five weeks. The first of the interim report's 40 recommendations is that those who breach the compulsory motor insurance obligations should face new sanctions and, in particular, uninsured vehicles should be confiscated.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It is right that the Bill before the House should prioritise employer's liability. We have been told by the industry that it is dealing with this difficulty and that premiums are reducing. The Alliance for Insurance Reform informed the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business last week of the case of a young couple in County Monaghan. The people involved, who were setting up a business, were given a quote of €75,000. When they were advised by their bank to try to get another quote, the same broker reduced the sum to €61,000 five days later. Three weeks later, when the bank decided it needed its name on the policy for collateral reasons, the couple checked the policy in minute detail. They discovered that the premium being charged by the insurer was €50,000. When they asked the broker to explain this, he printed out a break-down of the costs, the details of which were forwarded to the joint committee. The insurance company was to receive €50,000, a further 18% was to be paid in commission to the broker in Dublin who placed the insurance with the insurer and 3.5% was to be given to the small broker in County Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The couple in question were familiar with the insurance company, which was charging €50,000, because it is a wholly-owned Irish company. When they consulted the company, it was so appalled that it reduced its premium to €45,000. In effect, the insurance costs being demanded of a couple which was trying to start up a business in rural Ireland decreased from €75,000 to €45,000 over the space of four weeks. This case is typical of the difficulties that are being experienced. I do not wish to elaborate much further in this regard because the joint committee has published its report, which is based on hard evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The brokers of Ireland have acted in a decent manner, generally speaking, over the years. They have carried the can for generations. I recall that certain brokers acted as bankers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, when there was a flight of the earls. They paid the premiums to allow family businesses and small businesses to continue. I am trying to be fair to the brokers. The brokers that are ripping people off at present are not doing credit to their industry. They should be investigated by the brokerage industry and dealt with accordingly. The joint committee has passed on a complaint to the Competition Authority because the products of a major insurer in this country were not being passed on by three major brokers to clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The Bill before the House will introduce regulations and a degree of common sense to this sector of the insurance market. It will give everyone a fair reward for an injury. All Deputies agree that if someone is unfortunate enough to have an injury, they should receive a just award. We want such people to be given such an award directly. We do not want the moneys to be passed indirectly to others who did not suffer. It seems to be the case that the latter group of people are receiving almost as much as those who are involved in accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business look forward with great interest to 10 and 11 December, when the Committee Stage debate on this Bill will take place. I compliment everybody associated with the Bill. I could speak on this matter for an hour, but I will conclude by saying that Members of the Oireachtas on all sides of the House have waited for this Bill. I am not making any form of political point. Those who showed the courage to bring this Bill forward to where it is today deserve to be commended. This Bill will protect those who create industry and jobs, as well as those who protect people who are unfortunate enough to be injured.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_312">In introducing the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 in the Seanad, the Minister, Deputy Harney, said that "its objective is to tackle the delivery cost of speedier compensation to genuine claimants while reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses alike." It is unfortunate that she did not go on to make an attempt to quantify this aspiration. I am afraid that she has left a huge gap in the presentation of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The Government, by giving no guarantees, is telling us that it is taking a shot in the dark. It hopes that the outcome of this legislation will be a reduction in costs so that ordinary people and small businesses will not continue to be at the mercy of the insurance industry to such a great extent. We cannot afford to hold our breath while waiting for sharply reduced insurance costs, unfortunately. This is especially true when one considers the Government's poor record in respect of challenging vested business interests and tackling the exploitation and outrageous profiteering of some such interests. I am afraid that the Government's record on some of these business interests does not give us an enormous amount of hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">For six and a half years, the Government allowed developers and land speculators to profiteer at will at huge cost and suffering to ordinary working people, particularly young people. The cost of housing is still a disaster some six and a half years after the Government came into power and no serious successful attempts have been made to tackle that small minority of society whose racketeering has put a basic human right beyond the reach of so many people. Similarly, there has been a complete failure to tackle the drinks industry and other powerful retail industries in regard to the rip-off culture and practices that exist within them. While I was preparing notes for this debate, it occurred to me that the initials for the Republic of Ireland, ROI, are suitable initials for "rip-off Ireland", a culture which the Government has endorsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The Tánaiste, in particular, must carry the guilt in this regard. She has told us to shop around in answer to complaints from consumer bodies and ordinary people about the huge rip-offs and profiteering evident in certain sectors of retail and industry. However, the unfortunate working man and woman are trying fulfil their working and family lives. They are working extra hours to pay for expensive mortgages as a result of the Government's failure to curb house prices. Must these people also drag themselves from shop to shop spending time they do not have in the hope they will find someone with more of a conscience than another? This is an ineffective and ludicrous position which the Tánaiste advanced on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Nowhere else is this more evident than in the continued bleeding of young drivers by insurance companies. The Motor Insurance Justice Action Group, which lobbied on behalf of young drivers, has done excellent work in recent years in bringing the extent and nature of this rip-off to public attention and putting the Government under some pressure on the issue. Unfortunately, the issue has not been resolved and there are still huge problems with young people being victimised by the insurance industry, irrespective of their records and sense of responsibility, which many have. It has come out in the wash in the past year or so that the insurance companies make substantial profits from most categories of drivers, including most categories of young drivers. However, it is still the case that young people who need a car for work in many cases are faced with €3,000, €4,000 and €5,000 a year demands from insurance companies. This is an abject failure of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Some Fianna Fáil Deputies have waxed eloquent about the crippling cost of insurance to small businesses, which is true. However, the Government has not taken the situation in hand by moving to stop the profiteering at the expense of small business, let alone the community centres and other voluntary groups which are being crippled by public liability insurance. That notwithstanding, the Government can move quickly against sections of our society when their actions displease the Government, and it throws decent PAYE taxpayers into prison within days of making peaceful protests about unjust stealth taxes. The Tánaiste also waxed eloquent about the alleged anarchy these people were causing. However, the real anarchy which is being caused by the powerful vested business interests, including the insurance industry, does not merit anything like the same condemnation from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Much has been made of the litigation costs of the current insurance system. This applies equally to the legal profession and the medical and engineering professions, where exorbitant fees are demanded and, simply for being on standby, can be commanded. The Government has, for many years, failed to take any action against a section of barristers who have been able to write their own demands for payment without let or hindrance, no matter what cost was involved. As a result of the Government's failure to resolve a just fees regime in the courts, it is now forced to resolve the problem through the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">We should give the Government proposal the benefit of the doubt since it could not be worse than what exists. There are problems with the details of the Bill in that an unfair advantage to the insurance companies is written into it and the restrictions placed on claimants having certain legal assistance is unfair considering the insurance companies will have huge legal expertise behind them. It is not a question of wanting €5,000 a day barristers. Rather, one could have legal advisers with strictly restricted levels of fees. The possibility is also there for insurance companies to renege completely on a determination with which they disagree and to drag the claimant back to the courts, which is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The insurance industry should be in public ownership as an essential industry for society and should be run on the basis of the needs of the public, rather than for the maximisation of profits for multinational corporations. The board is not one which is in the best interest of ordinary people. It should be a completely independent board rather than one which features established big-business interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Mar focal scor, dúirt An Tánaiste gur cheart go mbeadh cúiteamh do éilitheoirí níos saoire ná mar atá i láthair na huaire.

          <p eId="para_322">I was going to begin by acknowledging the presence of the Tánaiste, who, in a welcome development, was here for the first couple of hours of proceedings this morning. My party's spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment was somewhat perturbed when he noticed that she was not one of the main speakers at the start of the debate. I accept, however, that there may have been factors involved which led to her not being present. With respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, who is present, it is a matter of even greater concern that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not have a rota in place to ensure that one of its two Ministers of State is here for the entire Second Stage debate.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_324">Given that this Bill is meant to be flagship legislation, the way it is being dealt with says something about the way the Government views the proceedings of the House, particularly on Fridays, and the value it places on Members' contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Having said that, I welcome this legislation. The explanatory memorandum states: "The Board will be charged with the making of assessments, without the need for legal proceedings to be brought." Those words indicate the degree of political pressure the Government must be feeling from particular vested interests involved in the area of insurance claims and those who, technically and actually, benefit from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The title "Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill" might indicate that the legislation is aimed solely at the individual. I would argue, however, that the effect of proper reform in the area of insurance will be a collective benefit. In the area of public liability, there is no doubt that those who suffer most are those, who through their own time and effort, provide social services that the Government is unwilling or unable to properly resource. Anyone involved in community or voluntary work will be aware that a great deal of time and effort is unnecessarily expended on fundraising for exorbitant premia that are subsequently used to bolster the services offered by community and voluntary groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">If I am disappointed about any aspect of the Bill, it is that it is another piece in the jigsaw in this area. However, the Government is unwilling to articulate what is its wider policy in respect of the said area. There is no doubt that a detailed policy is required in respect of insurance reform. Previous legislation abolished juries from court cases involving insurance claims. We now know that claims from the insurance industry that the latter would reduce the number of claims proved incorrect. I am concerned that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board might suffer a similar fate unless it is properly supported by further legislation and adequate resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The naked profiteering that occurs in the insurance industry, both on the part of the insurance companies and those who make tremendous living from processing insurance claims through legal mechanisms, is matched to some extent by anecdotal evidence of a compensation culture. Fraudulent claims are made by a small minority of people. Everyone would know of a family, the different members of which would share a neck brace or set of crutches depending on which one of them was making a compensation claim at a given time. False and malicious claims clog up the system and delay the genuine claims of people who should rightly expect immediate redress and monetary recompense.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The type of mirror image that exists between those who make false and malicious claims and the profiteering engaged in by some members of the legal profession and the insurance companies is a reflection of the individualisation of society. Ours is a mé féin society, which the Progressive Democrats have played no small part in creating. In recent interviews, the Minister has indicated that she is tired of the position she currently holds and that she wants to move on. This legislation appears to be her parting shot. If that is the case, we have a responsibility to point out that the flaws which exist in society in respect of the insurance issue are due in no small part to that credo of individualisation under which those who can do better by ripping off the system tend to do so. In general terms, however, I believe that the House will favour the establishment of a mechanism which will avoid much of the unnecessary cost and profiteering found in the system at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Spokespersons for the insurance industry, through the Irish Insurance Federation, have referred to the difficult times it has experienced in the past. However, one strange aspect of the industry is the extent to which it makes profits. I do not refer here merely to overall profits. The Irish insurance industry seems unique in that it makes profits on its underwriting, which is a relatively modern phenomenon. The theory behind insurance is that a profit is rarely, if ever, made on underwriting because the idea is to amass large sums of money which, if properly invested, generate profits. In Ireland, however, insurance companies seem to demand the right that premiums themselves must outweigh the payments made at any given time. They have a right, therefore, to make a profit that seems not to exist in other jurisdictions. I would argue that this is because the political systems and those who support the industries in those countries are not strong enough or do not allow such behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The Green Party is generally supportive of what is being suggested in the legislation. On Committee Stage, our spokesperson will seek to introduce a number of amendments. We will be pressing the Government and whoever has responsibility for carrying forward this agenda in the future – it obviously will not be the current Minister – to ensure that a more all-encompassing policy on insurance reform comes into being. This piece of the jigsaw only tackles a small part of the overall problem. If we are successful in ultimately solving the insurance conundrum, those who will benefit will be communities and society in general. I do not believe that the Government has a will to introduce the type of reforms to allow this to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">I commend the Government on placing the issue of insurance costs under the spotlight. The huge increase in insurance premiums has become a burden, not just to motorists but also to business people and consumers in general. I pay tribute to the Minister and the Ministers of State for working hard to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Two of the major contributing factors to the recent reduction in insurance costs have been, in the case of motor insurance, the penalty points system and the huge decrease in the number of accidents it has brought about and, on the industrial side, the work of the Health and Safety Authority. These are positive developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Before proceeding I must declare an interest in that I have been a practising member of the Bar since 1985. I have participated in the profession largely in the area of civil litigation, torts, or civil wrongs, and obtaining compensation for people who have been injured in accidents of various types.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I have worked for people who have suffered injuries and for insurance companies which have been obliged to defend cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">It is important to state that what we are discussing here is the tort system. A tort is defined as a civil wrong. When people come before the courts seeking compensation, they are the victims of a civil wrong. They come before the courts, as they are fully entitled to do, seeking redress for a civil wrong. The major instrument the courts can use to redress civil wrongs is that of awarding compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">People have different views on compensation but I am critical of the insurance industry. Many years ago the industry advocated the abolition of juries in compensation cases. When this was done there was not a substantial decrease in the compensation awarded by judges sitting alone. The establishment of the PIAB is an attempt to reduce insurance premiums but I am not sure it will work. The insurance industry has stated it cannot guarantee that the operation of the board will reduce premiums.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMulcahyFF" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_343">We may well be. In the absence of a promise from the insurance industry, which should be forthcoming, the board should be abolished if it does not work because its only rationale is to reduce insurance premiums. The insurance industry has a case to answer and it should give a guarantee that premiums will reduce over time, otherwise this body should not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Insurance premiums will not substantially decline as a result of the establishment of this body. As Deputy Cassidy stated, tens of thousands of uninsured vehicles are on our roads currently. Tackling that problem would reduce premiums but the PIAB will not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">One solution to the problem could be to increase the jurisdiction of the courts. The District Court has jurisdiction up to €6,300, the Circuit Court up to €38,000, while the High Court has unlimited jurisdiction. The costs awarded in the District Court are small. This issue was raised a number of years ago. Why not increase the jurisdiction of the District Court to €10,000, €15,000 or even €20,000 and that of the Circuit Court to €80,000 or even €100,000? The vast majority of personal injury awards amount to between €3,000 and €20,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I have two concerns about the legislation. The first is that there will not be oral hearings. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, in a previous guise, served as Minister of State at the Department of Labour. That Department established the Employment Appeals Tribunal, a non-adversarial and informal body which has worked effectively. However, the tribunal holds oral hearings at which aggrieved workers are given the opportunity to make their case to an adjudicating panel, which can make awards. The submission of written details to the PIAB may mean some people are over compensated while others under compensated. One cannot better an individual appearing before a judge or judges to state his or her case, following which the evidence is weighed up and an award is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">My second concern relates to legal costs. People involved in accidents will have to attend a solicitor to be advised about their rights under the PIAB legislation. Many citizens cannot read or write, for example, and they will require assistance to make an application. When they receive their awards, they will require legal advice to ascertain whether the awards are reasonable and acceptable. Such legal advice is costly and the claimants will have to pay for the advice out of their awards from the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">That breaches a fundamental principle of tort compensation, which is that the wrongdoer should pay. By making the claimant pay for legal advice out of his or her award, the tortfeasor, or wrongdoer, will be let off the hook in terms of legal costs. It is not practical or fair that people should enter this process without legal advice. That is not in the interest of the average citizen or people on whom a wrong has been visited. This issue should be examined on Committee Stage so that claimants can be awarded reasonable legal costs from the PIAB fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Many cases taken to the Employment Appeal Tribunal are not appealed to the Circuit Court because the claimants are normally advised by a solicitor. If many cases proceed without legal advice under the PIAB process and such advice is given only following the making of the award, many people will ignore the award by the PIAB and litigate their cases through the courts, which will do away with the rationale for the legislation. The Bill is unnecessary, unfair to injured parties and legally problematic.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I refer to two other legal issues. When an award is made, it must be enforced and, therefore, legal advice will be required. Second, until recently, one had to initiate a personal injury claim within three years of the incident under the Statute of Limitations but that has been amended to one year. Will the institution of a claim under the PIAB process stop the clock ticking with regard to the Statute of Limitations? The Bill states awards must be granted within nine months of a claim being made, but if the Statute of Limitations expires during that period, will a claimant be statute barred from taking a claim?</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I fully support what the Minister is trying to achieve. If the board reduces premiums and processes cases more quickly and efficiently, I am all for it but I ask the insurance industry where is the beef. The industry promised us that when juries were abolished premiums would reduce but they did not. The industry has said there is no guarantee premiums will reduce under the PIAB process. If there is no such guarantee, why is another layer of bureaucracy being added to the system? Cases are currently heard in the District Court and the Circuit Court within six months of claims being taken and there is a nine month provision in the legislation. I would support this structure if the correct guarantees were in place and the insurance industry delivered on what it has promised. Thus far, the industry has failed to keep its part of the bargain and, therefore, the jury is out on whether this structure is necessary.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wilkinson</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I am delighted we have reached a stage in the insurance debate where the matter is actually being debated in this House. Over the past three years in particular, the hike in insurance premiums has been both unfair and unjustified. I welcome the decision to publish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003. When enacted it will provide for the establishment of the PIAB on a statutory footing. That will reduce the cost of delivering compensation by eliminating the need for expensive legal fees and providing a speedier means of finalising personal injury assessments for genuine claimants, in comparison to the current court based system.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The PIAB is not being set up to cut the level of awards to claimants. Litigation costs add in excess of 40% to the cost of compensation and that has contributed to the high cost of insurance in this country. By eliminating the need for litigation costs, where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation. Independent research has shown that claimants in Ireland wait six times longer than in the UK for negotiations to commence on personal injury claims. There has, for some time, been a public demand for an alternative to the existing litigation system. I am pleased the Government is now providing that alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I am confident that when the PIAB is up and running, further cuts in insurance premia will ensue. Undoubtedly, the road safety measures introduced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, will also help. It has been stated that it is because of the compensation culture in this country that many more insurance companies are not getting involved in the Irish market. There has been much talk of cartels in the insurance business but the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am a member, has not been given any evidence of that. However, it is true that many insurance companies do not cover all kinds of risks and perhaps, therefore, cartels exist under another guise.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">On its return to office in June 2002, the Government set out a comprehensive programme to reform the insurance market and a clear path for the achievement of reform. Since then, the Government has given high priority to insurance reform in its legislative programme. I am pleased the Government is delivering on its commitment in regard to the PIAB. As a result of this and other Government initiatives, such as those of the Minister for Transport, which are already bearing fruit, further significant cuts in insurance premia are likely.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The establishment of the PIAB will, undoubtedly, save lives and protect jobs. I especially endorse the provisions on motor insurance. Uninsured drivers add 10% to the insurance premiums of honest motorists. The proposal to confiscate the cars of those who drive without insurance, as set out in the interim report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, must be acted upon. The report also recommended new legislation to regulate driving schools and deal with licensing of young drivers in particular. There has been appalling carnage among younger drivers and that shocking loss of life must be stopped. It is encouraging to note the substantial reduction in the number of fatalities and serious injuries on our roads, but a great deal still remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">In the context of jobs, insurance premiums are the main cost facing businesses. Personal injuries and the compensation culture are a major factor. The establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board should result in the removal of legal costs from the compensation process. Cutting the cost of business insurance will help competitiveness and save jobs. The civil liability and courts Bill must also be introduced as a matter of urgency. I particularly welcome the proposal that people who make false claims could be charged with perjury.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Oireachtas committee report on insurance, to which I referred, is not the end of the process. That all-party committee, which is under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Cassidy, will continue to be vigilant in monitoring the insurance industry in all our interests. We are determined to ensure that the price of insurance will fall. Rising premiums have, naturally, had a bad economic effect on business and jobs. According to the Small Firms Association's list of obstacles encountered by businesses, insurance costs are public enemy No. 1, having been ranked by 19% of respondents as their main problem and by 83% as a business problem. Insurance costs over the year to May 2003 increased by an average of 52%, but many companies had increases in the region of 70%.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_367">I welcome this important Bill but I have some serious reservations about it. The chief executive of Allianz said recently that he could not see the price of insurance coming down as a result of the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. I am concerned that a claimant who goes before the PIAB will not have legal representation, but the insurance company against which such a claimant is making a claim will have legal representation. Some Deputies opposite also raised this point. It is important that claimants should have legal representation. The board and the insurance company concerned would be familiar with dealing with insurance claims, but a claimant might not.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The high cost of insurance was one of the Minister's bugbears and she promised that when she came into office she would try to reduce it. I hope this Bill, when enacted, will help to achieve that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_369">Many organisations made representations to the committee dealing with recommendations to solve the problem of the high cost of insurance. The committee tried to take on board the points put forward in most of the submissions. Many submissions were made by people with vested interests, particularly the legal profession. That profession put forward two reasonably good points which must be taken into consideration. One is the ability of some people to submit proper claims to the PIAB without the assistance of some legal advice or support from a family solicitor. The other point is that insurance companies can accept liability at the PIAB stage but later refute it if not satisfied with the settlement reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">It is important to demonstrate from the start that the PIAB is about delivering compensation in a fair and cost effective manner to claimants who genuinely need to be compensated. The legal fees of a plaintiff are covered in a case that is successful in court, but a person who considers he or she needs the advice of, say, a family solicitor, will be immediately out of pocket. In an exchange between Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and the Minister on this issue, I understood the Minister to say that in those circumstances the respondent would be responsible for the claimant's legal fees. That needs to be properly clarified because I cannot find anything in the Bill to indicate that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, pointed out yesterday that it has been alleged that respondents will contest a case going to assessment with the intention of rejecting the award and fighting liability in court. This is an issue of concern. While he maintained it makes no financial or tactical sense for respondents to waste fees on the PIAB and then incur litigation costs, some respondents with the necessary resources may use these tactics. With regard to the establishment of the PIAB, the Minister of State indicated yesterday that the priority would be to implement fair procedures, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, in such a document only process.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Questions have been raised about the possibility of legal challenges to the Bill because of the constitutional rights of claimants. Many people have commented on this and the legal profession has been insistent that there could be problems in this regard and that justice and fair play would not be seen to be achieved if the Bill, as it stands, is implemented. Deputies Hogan and Howlin pointed out that they consider this to be a problem, but they were confident that amendments introduced on Committee Stage could address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">As the PIAB is the central plank in the strategy to bring down insurance costs, it is essential that it works properly. We cannot risk a return to high premia or a continuation of premia at current levels. They have had a devastating effect on our society and economy. Thousands of jobs have been lost and our competitiveness as a nation is being affected. Our young people are being disadvantaged from a social and work point of view. Communities, social groups, sports organisations and event organisers have failed to maintain certain activities due to the high cost of insurance. The PIAB must do its utmost to demonstrate from the start that it provides a straightforward and just way of delivering compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Claimants should be allowed cover for legal costs to ensure that they can make a proper submission. Insurance companies should not be allowed to change their plea in terms of admitting liability if a case subsequently goes to court. With the insertion of amendments to address these two issues and the introduction of a reasonable book of quantum, I am confident the PIAB system can work.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Assuming that it will work in conjunction with other legislation, we still have to deal with and overcome the built in compensation culture that is prevalent in our society. There is no doubt that the legal profession has promoted this culture and must now pay the price. There is also no doubt that the ordinary citizen was encouraged to claim if an insurance company was the target. The attitude that it is only an insurance company which is being hit must be challenged. Every case in which compensation is paid affects every citizen. People pay for it in the cost of car insurance, home insurance, public liability insurance and employer's liability insurance. It is the ordinary citizen who pays for such compensation and who has been paying for the extraordinary fees charged by barristers, solicitors, engineers and doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The escalating cost of insurance has already cost many ordinary people their jobs. Our exports have been hit by its effect on competitiveness. The cost of living for every citizen has gone through the roof, as high insurance costs play a large role in every aspect of our lives. The end result is that the ordinary citizen is paying dearly for false claims and the excessive costs incurred in delivering compensation in genuine cases. It is one's neighbour, friend, son and daughter who is paying for compensation claims, not some magic fund as was generally believed in the past, from which insurance companies could drawdown and in respect of which people could make dubious gains. In addition to the new laws and procedures that will be introduced, we must get this message across. The insurance companies are only facilitating the passing of our money to people who need compensation as a result of having being injured, although admittedly they make a substantial profit in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">For this reason it is equally important that the business transactions of insurance companies are fully transparent. The controller of the financial services sector must have the proper powers to ensure that insurance companies are not manipulating their books to benefit their profit lines. The manipulation of reserves is difficult to follow, but the controller must ensure transparency. This is all the more important since all but one of the four major players in the insurance market here is Irish, the other three being controlled by foreign companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Having got the structures right and having put this board in place, it is important to keep in mind the competition issue. Fine Gael advocated recently that we are living a common market and therefore we should be able to source insurance at a competitive price anywhere within the European Union, but without competition in this market this system will not be a success.</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_379">I apologise for the absence of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, as she is unavailable for important reasons. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, is in Galway with the President. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, has just returned from Edinburgh. My presence here, and that of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, earlier, is as a result of our involvement with the Department in the previous Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">This pioneering legislation provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board whose objective is to tackle the delivery cost of speedier compensation to genuine claimants, while reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses alike. The PIAB will offer a lower cost and speedier means of finalising genuine personal injury claims than the current litigation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The establishment of the PIAB is in the public interest. The PIAB is not being set up to cut the level of awards to genuine claimants. Awards will remain at current levels. The role of the PIAB will be confined to claims where legal issues are not disputed by the respondent and there are no reservations about the genuineness of the claim. Exaggerated claims should be defended in the courts and new provisions will be introduced under the civil liability and courts Bill by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The PIAB is not designed to deny people's access to the courts or to their entitlement to seek independent legal advice. The priority for the PIAB will be to implement fair procedures in accordance with the principles of natural justice as they apply in this "documents only" procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Deputies Hogan and Howlin, and other Members, referred to the issue of legal representation. The claim that the PIAB will be unfair to unrepresented claimants is not true. This is not an adversarial system and representation will not be required. The PIAB will not conduct oral hearings. There are limited opportunities for respondents, or their insurers, to attack the claimant's claim once the case has been accepted as one appropriate for assessment of quantum only. The PIAB will avail of its own expertise, either on staff or from appointed independent consultants, to assess the validity of a claim and will not indulge in an adversarial process between competing parties' experts. The PIAB will always communicate directly with claimants to ensure they know exactly how their case is progressing through each stage of the assessment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Legal representation would effectively cut the claimant out of the communications loop and may expose the claimant to additional and unnecessary costs. The inquisitorial approach adopted by the PIAB will ensure the claimant gets what they are entitled to – no more, no less. This approach will be of assistance to claimants on many issues where they may currently seek legal advice even in assessment only cases which do not involve legal disputes.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">At the end of the PIAB process, the parties are entitled to reject the award if they consider they would secure a more favourable outcome through the court system. The PIAB will issue an authorisation for the claimant to proceed to litigation within a specified timeframe if he or she wishes to pursue the matter. From the planned effective date, all relevant non-litigation cases, which currently require the issuing of legal proceedings, will be subject to mandatory referral to the PIAB before they can proceed to adversarial litigation. If the respondent wishes to dispute legal issues or has reservations about the genuineness of the claim, the PIAB will immediately issue an authorisation for the claimant to proceed to litigation if he or she wishes to pursue the matter further.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The PIAB will endeavour to deal with assessments within specific time limits unlike the current litigation system where no such target dates are set for completion of cases. The PIAB will give genuine claimants a speedier settlement. A respondent's agreement to a claimant's submission for the PIAB assessment will not constitute an admission of liability nor can it be used in any other manner to prejudice legal arguments in subsequent court proceedings. Requiring a respondent to admit liability in advance of a PIAB assessment would effectively stymie the entire process because there would be no incentive for respondents to consent to the PIAB assessment process rather than going to the courts directly. This is what we are trying to prevent.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The PIAB will have the power to levy charges and will be a break-even operation without being a draw on the Exchequer. Funding of the PIAB will be primarily on a case by case fee, payable by the respondent as the most transparent and equitable distribution of costs. The board will make special provision for vulnerable parties and will take steps to ensure the application process is straightforward. The PIAB staff will provide assistance to either party where required and explain the consequences of a party either taking or not taking a step during the process. Cases involving claimants who lack full legal capacity will be subject to ruling by the court, such as persons under 18 years of age, persons of unsound mind or dependants after a fatal accident. In the case of a minor or a person of unsound mind, the PIAB will direct that they get legal advice with the costs borne by the respondent. In exceptional cases, the PIAB may direct the claimant to incur, most likely medical, expenses. Such expenses will be borne by the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Deputy Howlin referred to a lay person's guide to the PIAB. This document has since been updated in consultation with the National Adult Literacy Agency. In addition, the PIAB will have simple-to-use guides for claimants, respondents and treating doctors. This will greatly assist all parties in the PIAB process. The PIAB will also operate a helpline to assist parties throughout the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The board will consist of members representing the interests of employees, employers, consumers, insurers, as well as a chief executive. The board will also include members with relevant expertise such as that in the legal and medical field. The PIAB is not supposed to be a panacea for all the ills in the insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The establishment of the PIAB is one key element of the Government's insurance reform programme. Other vital elements in this programme include road safety initiatives and measures to deal with fraudulent and exaggerated claims. Taken as a package, these reform initiatives being undertaken will lead to a properly functioning market that will attract new entrants and provide the much needed competition to reduce premia further. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnnyBrady" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. J. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_393">I welcome this appropriate and progressive Bill and congratulate the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his Department on introducing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Until recently there was little or no effort made to assist disabled people to lead a normal life. Educational disability, intellectual or physical, has been neglected for far too long. It is important we give credit to the voluntary groups who have been fighting for the rights of people with special needs for many years. Voluntary groups have done a great deal of work in the background. When others ignored the needs of those with disabilities, it was the hard working members of voluntary organisations who worked tirelessly, highlighting the issues. These groups deserve recognition now that they have ensured that the voices of those with special needs are finally being heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The most important group that should be recognised are the parents of the disabled. It is the parents who provide for and ensure that these special children have everything they need from birth. It is not an easy task and I commend them for their dedication and unconditional love. An important aspect in this Bill is that the parents are recognised as central to the development of the child at every step in the process. When a child's education plan is drawn up, the parent will always be consulted. They are at the heart of the assessment and planning process. They are also vital in ensuring that those rights are always upheld at every stage of the child's education.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Bill gives parents the power to appeal to an independent appeals board against any statement or description they believe is inadequate to meet their child's needs or if they feel there has been a failure to implement their child's education plan. This aspect of the Bill is essential as it provides a bottom up approach to the provision of special needs education. It is essential the rights and entitlements of special needs students are not dictated to parents, who know their child's need better than anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The Bill pays tribute to the parents of the disabled, particularly young disabled people. The parent or parents must deal with this from the cradle to the grave. It is a lifelong service of dedication, not simply one involving eight or ten-hour days, five days a week. It is a 24-hour service provided by the parent seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">We must all acknowledge that successive Governments neglected this area for decades. While this debate took off in the 1980s it was not until the 1990s that any Government did anything about it. It is only now the Government is trying to right the wrongs of the past and make a concerted effort to do everything possible to provide for the needs of the disabled in this country. It was only in 1997 that there was an improvement in the response to children in need of special education.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In 1998 the Government created a funding programme that proactively responded to the requirements of students with special educational needs. We also saw all primary school children with special needs receive an automatic right to see those needs met that same year. As a result, the number of resource teachers in ordinary schools has increased from 104 to 2,300. The number of special needs assistants has also risen from fewer than 300 to almost 5,500 full and part-time positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">However, we still have a long way to go. Society must learn to change its attitude towards those with special needs. We must realise that they, like all of us, have aspirations and ambitions. We must recognise that all children, including those with special needs, have a right to realise those ambitions. We must also understand that children with special needs are fantastic people who will enrich the lives of the other children in their classes under an inclusive educational system.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I welcome the fact that the Bill is based on the principle of inclusive education for as many children with educational disabilities as is practicable. This principle has been Government policy for a long time. The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will turn this policy into real action with section 2 providing that a child with special needs will be educated in an inclusive setting unless it is not in the best interest of the child in question or the other children in the class. We must keep in mind that in many cases an inclusive educational environment will be extremely good for all children involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The most important element of this Bill is the fact that it provides a statutory guarantee of education services for people with a disability. For the first time in Ireland a statutory framework will be put in place in which the education of children with special needs can be guaranteed as a right enforceable by law. The education plan plays an essential role in the creation and development of this statutory framework. The education plan will ensure that all children with special needs have their disabilities identified, their needs assessed, goals decided upon to meet their needs and their progress monitored. This is a great approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">In the past, children with disabilities were offered no assistance when seeking education. On the contrary, children with disabilities were presumed stupid and incapable of receiving an education. Rather than being assisted they were excluded from education completely. Even in the recent past while marginal resources were given to children with disabilities, adequate attention was not given to special education.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I welcome this initiative. It is essential that we identify that every child with a special need is an individual. The education plan will ensure that this individuality is recognised. It will examine his or her level of disability as well as his or her individual needs. It is only through the structured implementation of a cohesive plan that we can be sure that children with special needs will receive the best education possible and the greatest opportunities available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I broadly welcome this significant legislation. It will without doubt, be met with challenges. There will be financial challenges, as the implementation of the policy will need serious funding. However, I urge the Minister for Finance to do his best to provide this funding. People with disability in Ireland have waited far too long for this type of provision and it must be implemented as quickly and as fully as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">It will create challenges for the Government, particularly for the Minister concerned. It will create huge challenges for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his successors. A great deal of money has been invested in this area in recent years. Future Deputies will have to deal with the growth in expenditure in this area. Perhaps the financial nature of this issue is secondary to the debate, but this problem has not yet been fully addressed. For too long children with disabilities have been ignored. They have not received the same opportunities as other children and have not received the same rights to education as other children. This legislation finally changes that. I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science for taking the courageous and giant step in creating such proactive legislation. I wholeheartedly commend it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">A more important landmark case was the O'Donoghue case, which also had its genesis in the Cork South-Central constituency. This case was taken by Marie O'Donoghue on behalf of her son, Paul, in the mid-1990s during the lifetime of the rainbow Government when Niamh Breathnach was the Minister for Education. That case was also contested by the Government right up to the steps of the Supreme Court where the State reached a settlement. The argument centred on the principle of education as a lifelong right for all in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Education is not about turning out automatons to benefit society economically. It is about enhancing the potential of each human being. The difficulty with education for people with disabilities, particularly for those with an intellectual disability, is that the State has constantly asked how this can be justified economically and how people can develop a capacity to justify economically their place in society. I fear this Bill with its age-related links perpetuates that thinking within the Government and the Civil Service. It is an attitude that needs to be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Ultimately the question arises as to why there should be a Bill for the education of persons with disabilities. The model adopted in the United States and in Scandinavia is that the scope of such legislation should be incorporated with general disabilities legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Swedish model being prime examples. This Government, for reasons best known to itself, has decided to adopt a divide and rule approach to different aspects of disabilities legislation. This is the opening shot while people wait, possibly in vain, for a more general rights-based disabilities Bill which many who live with disability expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Government has been reluctant to go down that road, however. Even where it has made initiatives since 1997, there is a question over the future use of resources. I have in mind the pilot project of the Cork applied behaviour analysis schools, CABAS, to help people living with autism within a specialised educational system to move eventually into mainstream education. It has proven to be a successful pilot project, yet the schools have not been given any indication whether the Government will continue to resource them even in the medium-term, regardless of the long-term policy as regards education.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Questions must be asked about the integrity of this Bill. As with all Government legislation it carries the ever-present <i>caveat,</i>“as resources allow”. Those who claim a huge gap exists between what the people expect and what successive Governments are prepared to deliver see this as the ultimate barrier in providing those resources and putting in place rights-based legislation for citizens who can number up to 10% of the population. It is one of the political riddles that between one in ten and one in eight people live with a disability, yet it is always at the bottom of political priorities. It is as if every political party has concluded that the lives of these people are unimportant and that they are not valued. In the past such groups have not organised themselves politically, but the potential exists for so many people to vote against the political parties and policies that have effectively made them second-class citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">Ba mhaith liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, mar tá sé thar am dúinn a bheith á phlé anseo. Tá sé os ár gcomhair faoi dheireadh agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann tabhairt faoi na fadhbanna atá ann. Sa deireadh thiar thall tá an cuma ar an scéal go bhfuil an Rialtas agus an Stát ag bogadh ón tslí scannalach inar casadh an Bille um Oideachas do Dhaoine faoi Mhíchumas 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The issue of resourcing will be crucial to the success of this Bill. There is a structural need to ensure a close working relationship between the Department of Health and Children and the proposed Council for Special Education so that it functions effectively and smoothly. A resource issue is involved. The other resource issue entails the necessary money and resources being made available. Will all the schools that require special needs teachers have them? When the legislation is in operation will there be an end to principals, teachers and parents lobbying Deputies for additional resources and finance for their schools to tackle the basic needs of pupils with disabilities denied to them over the years because of neglect? There has been a blatant disregard for the need of those in our society with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Is the Minister saying that the priorities of Government have changed and that the needs of the most disadvantaged will be addressed? I will reserve my judgment until I see this legislation in action and the long-awaited and long-delayed disabilities Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">A glaring omission from this Bill is the failure to refer to the tremendous work of the existing special needs schools. They have survived on shoe-string budgets for many years and are continually left waiting for promised funding. In some cases vital programmes and projects are curtailed and put on hold.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The people most affected when funding is not put in place are those in need, especially the children. People involved in the provision of education for persons with disabilities deserve full support and backing. They require disability legislation that tackles the problems they and their parents face in the effort to deliver and receive an education.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Is gá a dhéanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an ceart ó thús ag tuismitheoirí agus ag daltaí míchumasacha a bheith bainteach le gach uile cinneadh a déantar maidir leis an oideachas a bhfuil siad chun a fháil. Fé láthair ní gá dul i gcomhairle le dalta nó le tuismitheoirí nuair atá coimre bhliantúil á dhéanamh ar phlean oideachasúil an pháiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Cad faoi an idirdhealú a dhéanann an Bille idir dhaltaí míchumasacha a shroicheann aois a 17 i gcomparáid leo siúd nach bhfuil míchumas orthu? Déantar coimre orthu siúd a bhfuil míchumas orthu ach cad a tharlóidh dos na daltaí míchumasachas atá taobh thiar sa scoil de thairbhe an mhíchumais sin nuair a chríochnaíonn siad leis an oideachas foirmiúil, agus gan ach an chéad bhliain nó an dara bliain den mheánscoil déanta acu, in ainneoin go bhfuil dul chun cinn fós á dhéanamh acu. I gcás cuid des na daoine a bhfuilimid ag caint fúthu beidh siad in aois 30 sula shroiseann siad an chaighdeán a bhéadh ag páiste eile ag aois 18. De réir Airteagal 40 den mBunreacht, "Áirítear gurb ionann ina bpearsain daonna na saoránaigh uile i láthair an dlí.". An bhfuil an tAire cinnte go bhfuil an Bille seo bunreachtúil?</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Tá ceisteanna móra eile maidir leis an mbord achomharc. I welcome the appeals board but questions must be asked with regard to it. I will suggest amendments, which, I hope, the Minister will accept, to ensure that the appeals board is more reflective of society and is not packed with Fianna Fáil fundraisers or the like. Nothing in the legislation requires that the members of the appeals board have expertise in the field of education. I hope the Minister will consider this matter. Neither does the Bill does require that membership of the board reflect the fact that 50% of the population are women. There are also problems regarding the time limits for appeals. That contradiction needs to be sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Caithfimid déanamh cinnte de go ritear an Bille seo, an Bille is fearr gur féidir linn a rith.

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_429">Most Members receive almost daily representations from parents, schools and teachers on the issues raised in the Bill. Rights and supports for persons with disabilities or special educational needs are at crisis levels, as indicated by the number of representations we receive concerning the refusal to appoint special needs assistants or significant delays in appointing them, thereby denying persons with disabilities access to educational opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">In recent months, I have received representations from various sources in my constituency, including the local vocational educational schools which, on the commencement of the school year in September, had still not received approval for special needs assistants to support students in Clonmel and Cahir. I have also received representations from a parent, whose child was due to attend a special school in Cashel, but had been deprived of educational opportunities for nearly two months before the Department eventually approved the relevant special needs assistants.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The same position applies to secondary schools. Another constituent's child, who was due to sit her junior certificate examination, was refused admission by a school until support services, resources and special needs assistants, had been made available for the child. The child in question has still not returned to school. A family with whom I have been dealing for many years found it almost impossible to find a primary school for their child on moving house due to the difficulty in finding a special needs assistant. Although we eventually overcame this hurdle, the parent of the child in question, who is now in sixth class, recently contacted me to ask what could be done to ensure the local secondary school would be able to take the child next year because the school had informed her that the Department must approve special needs assistance before it will be able to admit her child. She was advised to make representations to her local representatives immediately to try to ensure that approval was given.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">That such circumstances should arise during the European Year of People with Disabilities and only months after the Special Olympics says a great deal. The House should commend the various voluntary organisations working in this sector, including NAMHI, the Irish Society for Autism, Down Syndrome Ireland and others, which placed this issue on the agenda in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">In introducing this Bill, the Government put the cart before the House. A rights-based disabilities Bill should have come before the House first. The legislation is fundamentally flawed and should, like the two previous Bills on this issue, be withdrawn and sent back to the drawing board. Unconditional, enforceable rights similar to those enjoyed by other pupils should be afforded in legislation to persons with learning disabilities. Although this Bill fails to do so, I accept that it will pass its various Stages in the House and will probably be enacted in some shape or form. I hope some of the proposals and recommendations made by Opposition Members will be taken into account and the legislation amended accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The Bill is neither focused on the educational needs of the individual learner, nor does it respect the rights of the family as primary educator and representative of the learner. It also ignores learners who are capable of representing themselves. While the word "parent" is widely used in the text of the legislation, the role of parents in their child's education is confined to acting as a petitioner on behalf of their child. In addition, although the Title contains the term "people with disabilities", the Bill's provisions are confined to children and exclude adults, who are persons in their own right and in many cases also have disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">An independent, ongoing assessment of the individual needs of each child is required to ensure he or she is provided with appropriate education. This is a constitutional right which must not be dictated by resources or the lack thereof. Instead, we must make sufficient resources available to ensure that people with disabilities have the same constitutional rights as others.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The legislation is flawed as it does not address the minimum requirements of people with disabilities, their parents and families. I call on the Minister to ensure the Government introduces true rights based rather than resource constrained legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Bill's apparent exclusion of people with dyslexia must also be addressed, although the Minister of State referred to this group. I was shocked to find that children with dyslexia are not covered by the legislation. This is unacceptable and must be changed, particularly given that some 15,000 to 16,000 children in the primary school system and a similar number in the secondary school system have dyslexia. This aspect of the Bill needs to be addressed. In addition, the legislation does not refer to other disabilities such as ADD and ADHD, which should also be covered by its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The legislation must become a rights based Bill, with adequate resources made available to ensure that people with disabilities are in a position to avail of these rights. I hope the Minister will take this position on board and table amendments to give effect to rights based legislation and address the question of resources.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnEllis" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_445">As with most Deputies, I welcome the Bill. It is the first real attempt to guarantee the rights of persons with disabilities to education. We are all aware of people who have suffered as a result of disabilities. While some of them have been successful and overcome their disabilities, others have not been able to cope because they did not receive the necessary assistance in time. The person who really stands out is Richard Branson who is dyslexic. Many would say that people who are dyslexic have other assets which compensate for their dyslexia.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">This is the first time a Bill has tackled the problem in a coherent way. It is meant to be a partnership between the education system, the local teaching system, parents and the health boards. What concerns me is the way in which the educational needs of people with disabilities are identified. Where there are potential problems, the needs of these people should be identified as early as possible. We are all aware of cases where parents have had to wait for a long time to have children assessed. In some instances they have had to wait two to three years. The damage which can be done to one's esteem in that period is frightening. Those who are helped on time have a much better chance of overcoming their disability than those are left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Some health boards have extremely long waiting lists. Deputy Healy referred to dyslexia. This is a problem in some schools where teachers are not prepared to accept that there is a problem and sometimes children are eight, nine or ten years of age before the parents are approached. In some cases parents notice the problems of the child at home and approach the teachers to have the assessments carried out, which is frightening. As I said previously, there should be an assessment of each child within the first year or two in national school. It might cause annoyance to some mothers to have their children assessed but I believe it should be done for the child's sake. In many cases parents are not prepared to accept their children have a problem. It can often be a greater problem to get parents and teachers to accept a problem exists than it is to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I recently witnessed another scenario where different psychologists who assessed a child came up with two totally different reports. This was terrible from the point of view of someone being able to make a decision on the needs of that child in school. The case is still ongoing in the Department because one psychologist has stated the child needs one type of help while the other states the child needs different help. That a child can be assessed and not receive the help proposed is something which needs to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Deputy Healy referred to the voluntary organisations which have made a tremendous contribution down through the years. Teachers are very often involved directly and indirectly in the voluntary sector in dealing with the educational needs of people with disabilities. He mentioned one group, ACLD, which has done tremendous work throughout the country in helping people with their reading and writing needs. However, it is no longer acceptable to have to depend on the voluntary sector and the kindness of teachers on Saturday morning to ensure people are helped.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The back-up available must be questioned. It was stated that the implementation of the Bill will require resources. All the legislation that goes through the House has a financial cost which people accept must be met. The money invested in educating people with learning difficulties will be recouped many times over. In many instances, if the problems teenagers and others have were tackled at an earlier stage we would not have some of the social problems that arise today.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Teaching methods must be considered in the context of the Bill. I am aware people have rights in regard to assessment and help needed. We all support the introduction of special needs assistance. I hope that where special needs assistance is required something will be done. This is another aspect of the education sector which needs to be supported. One cannot expect teachers of mainstream classes to be able to cope with all the needs of pupils with special needs. There is a need to do something about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">In some instances parents can be reluctant to send their children to school because they may not be too happy with the local teacher. This can also lead to educational disadvantage. However, one would need to be Job to solve that problem, as well as having his patience. All of us as public representatives continue to receive representations from parents of children with special needs. A co-ordinated approach must be adopted to deal with this issue. This is the first time during my time in politics that there has been a co-ordinated approach to the education of people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Many people with disabilities, including their families, are more than willing to make sacrifices to ensure children with special needs get more attention and perhaps more help than those who do not have problems. The care of children with both physical and mental disabilities must be considered in the context of the Bill. The sooner children with disabilities are introduced into mainstream education, the better they will be able to cope in society at a later stage and the less problems they will have mixing and going about with their friends. It is terrible to think that in this day and age pupils leave national school unable to read or write. This is a terrible reflection on the entire education system. One can well imagine how their self-esteem must suffer when they move into their teenage years not having the basic education or being able to read and write.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">If given the necessary help on time, each child can be brought up to a basic educational standard which will allow them to get by in life. It is much easier to provide that help when children are young than it is when they reach the age of 14, 15 or 16 years. At that stage they feel they have missed out, been left out of the system and passed over. No child either in this country or anywhere else in the world should feel he or she has been let down by the system. As legislators, we have a duty to ensure that the legislation we pass works. In doing so, we must accept that there is a duty of responsibility on teachers, parents and health boards to implement the proposals in the Bill. If it is dealt with in any other way, it will be a failure. If everyone decides to put their shoulder to the wheel and assess each child properly, I have no doubt the Bill's benefits will be reaped by those who would otherwise be left behind by the education system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_455">When Deputy McGrath and I began teaching – I am sure the Minister was in short pants at the time – we were governed by a document entitled Rules and Regulations for National Schools. Deputy McGrath will recall the document covered matters like the time one called the roll, the type of black ink one used, the number of minutes per week one spent at comhrá A, comhrá B and comhrá C and the time of the day one taught religion. There was nothing in the document about a child. One could have been teaching almost units of wood in desks. There was no reference by the Department to its responsibilities to provide adequate resources. It was all down to the school manager, the school principal and the classroom teacher as to what should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Some of us are also around long enough to remember INTO and ASTI conferences where we called for the introduction of an education Act. We were bedevilled by circular letters. Anyone who has been a principal or acting principal would know that it would be a case of woe betide if a circular letter was lost when a cigire came in looking for it. One could end up in a mórfhiosrú situation. I do not jest, I merely outline how things have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">When I began teaching, special education was, to put it politely, the Cinderella of the education system. I was in a 33 teacher school in Finglas which had one special class that was located in the darkest and most remote room in the school. Had it not been for pioneering work by some very dedicated teachers we would never have made progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Members will examine the minutiae of the Bill, and rightly so, but it is also important that we recognise the contribution of people like Páid McGee who runs the special education course in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and how much they have transformed our attitude to special education. Others I should mention include Declan Costello for his work in setting up St. Michael's House, Dr. Paul McQuaid in the Mater Hospital, the work of the St. John of God's centre in Blackrock, people like Sally Hogarty and her school in the Phoenix Park, the work of Cheeverstown House, Scoil Chiaráin, Eamon Ó Murchú and Valerie Monaghan and the School for the Deaf in Cabra. The list is endless. Peter Quinn was one of the first pioneering psychologists in Orwell Road who laid much of the groundwork in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Department of Education and Science's special education section was located in dark dreary prefabs at the back of the offices in Marlborough Street. Following a fire it was moved to a dark dreary building in Talbot Street. Staff in this section spent their time rightly worrying about the residential centres as the provision of special education for children in mainstream schools became increasingly depleted. Thankfully, times have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I compliment the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, who brought forward the Education Act and the present Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for introducing the Education (Welfare) Act and this Bill. These provisions, in tandem with future legislation, will help complete the implementation of the necessary changes in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">While the Bill before us has its critics, it is coherent legislation and a huge step forward. One can legitimately criticise the present delivery of services where there are no clear lines of responsibility and where existing provision is too diffuse. Pass the parcel is forever being played between the health boards and schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Some aspects of the Bill are especially commendable. Section 2 refers to the need to provide an integrated education for children. One would have thought this was a given but, unfortunately, this has not been the case. Education has been segmented over the years and it has become more so. It is important that the legislation brings coherence to the delivery of education to children with special needs in ordinary classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">There is a risk that the legislation could lead to an over-identification of children with learning difficulty with children with educational disabilities. Deputy Paul McGrath and I probably taught children of the same age. Children can easily become labelled in their early years, which is a great pity. The intervention that was often required in the past was not provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Other speakers have referred to the types of intervention that are necessary. I agree that there is a chronic lack of speech therapy services. Many children would have little difficulty if there was adequate provision of such services in the early days. If delivered on, the education plan envisaged in the Bill will address this problem. The need for early assessment has also been discussed. We are all aware of how long it takes to get an assessment done. The NEPS is a huge improvement and it is getting the work done on an incremental basis. Many problems could be addressed if reports were provided earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Reference was made to dyslexia. Most of us who were teachers know that the letters b and d get reversed, as do numbers 3 and 5. Individual intervention by a sensitive teacher helps most children to grow out of this habit, but if it is not spotted early, it grows. One of the benefits of the Bill is that schools must ensure that all practicable efforts are made to assist children not benefiting from a regular education programme. The stipulation that assessments must not take longer than three months is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Let us not forget about the resources that have already been invested in this area. It is not a question of playing catch-up as there has already been a significant increase in the level of resourcing. Learning support teachers have increased from approximately 1,300 in 1998 to approximately 1,500 at present. The budget is about €54 million. Resource teachers have increased from 104 in 1998 to 2,300 at the moment. Irrespective of party politics, that is a significant investment. The number of special needs assistants increased from 300 in 1998 to nearly 4,500 full-time and a further 1,264 part-time posts in the same period, with a budgetary provision of €100 million in 2003. I accept that the resources being invested may not be sufficiently targeted. The allocation for part-time tuition services increased from €12 million in 2002 to €19 million in 2003. This is an indication of the level of need, some of which may still be unaddressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Many of us with an involvement in education have for a long time called for the introduction of an education plan. The Minister is keen to have the involvement of parents in the development of education plans. The process would not be as worthwhile without their involvement. They need to be consulted and to take equal ownership of plans. Plans need to be monitored at classroom and school level. The setting up of the special education council will provide for their better monitoring. Goals and objectives for children need to be clearly set down.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I am sure Deputy Paul McGrath also remembers the days when the inspector came to schools and ticked off the achievement of objectives in a regimented way, based on whether the class was achieving certain things. Long division was introduced at the end of fourth class and at a certain stage the class should have been dividing by numbers less than 20. Those were the kind of goals we had in the past but this is no longer part of a modern education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The Bill provides for necessary intervention for children who find themselves in difficulty. Its other important focus is in regard to parents of children with disabilities who want their children enrolled in the local primary school. Things have also improved in that area. I remember when a child with a degenerative disease was enrolled in our primary school. The difficulties we experienced trying to have the school's front door widened to permit wheelchair access, to get the Department to respond to the need to provide a disabled person's toilet and to have the local authority dish the footpaths, constituted a typical example of government which was not joined up. With previous legislation and the forthcoming disability Bill, the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will provide for the coherent, cohesive delivery of services to young people and children with special needs.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_474">Previous speakers have referred to the merits of the Bill and the need to introduce it. It has not come before the House before its time. It has been long awaited and it is long overdue. Teachers and people who have been in public life for some time cannot but feel saddened to see a mother bring a young child before them on a Saturday morning to inquire about the possibility of placing the child in a particular school to improve his or her chances of obtaining an education. Apart altogether from the merits of this Bill, we must recognise the children themselves. They do not realise what is ahead of them when they are three, four or five years of age. They are in no way responsible for or capable of altering the route that lies ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">It is difficult and heartrending from an onlookers point of view. From the parent's point of view it is a particularly hard road to follow. I compliment and commend the parents who spend so much time and energy pursuing the objective of securing the rights and facilities to allow their children to learn. Education allows those children to participate in some way in society. We must also recognise the tremendous work done by the teachers who have provided services to these children and the great burden they have carried. There is a need for more teachers to shoulder the burden in the future. We must commend organisations like St. Raphael's special school in my constituency, KARE and St. John of God's which have given tremendous support to children and young adults with disabilities. They will continue to meet their educational needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I make a special appeal to the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children. Despite increased investment and the recognition by the Department of Education and Science of children with special needs, there is a more serious and glaring gap in the requirements than there was previously. Every Member has countless constituents who plead on a weekly basis for a place for a child with particular needs. Sometimes a place is sought in mainstream education and at other times it is sought in a special school. We should always do our best to answer such calls, from whichever direction they come, to play a part in lightening the burden for people with these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">There is an economic benefit to doing so. We have come across this year after year. If a child with special needs has access to a reasonable standard of education, he or she will become capable of competing in society and of gaining access to the circle which prohibited such children from participating fully in the past. Everything that can be done should be done to make that possible. Notwithstanding other economic requirements and the exigencies of budgets, I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children to recognise the needs of persons with disabilities at this time. If we invest in this area today, we will see a greater benefit tomorrow. Enabling people with disabilities to participate now will ensure that they can help themselves in future. Failure on the part of society to respond to their needs while they are still young will yield a negative dividend in the future. Other speakers have referred to the issue of rights which must certainly be borne in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">One must recognise all of the carers who have cared for children and young adults with special needs through the years and who continue to do so. Their dedication and herculean efforts are only slightly recognised through the provision of carer's allowance. The dedication of the carer must be witnessed to be fully appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">At this time, we should focus on the right of access to educational facilities for all children. I do not make a political point. The quality of the fabric of many schools is deplorable. It is a sad reflection on our society that we have children who are committed during their entire school lives to education in pre-fabricated structures. Teachers and children are confined to damp conditions. Society is not treating the new generation fairly. I cannot understand why we cannot recognise in time that as the population increases and there are more children around, schools must be provided. Financial provision should be made for these schools well in advance. I make these points in respect of mainstream and special schools which are deficient in terms of structures and facilities. I ask the Minister to bear those needs in mind, particularly as we approach the festive season.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Bill before us is fine. I hope it is given the financial backing which will be required to make its provisions effective. There is no point having legislation unless it is effective and the necessary procedures and funding are put in place. Otherwise, it is nothing more than a cosmetic exercise. It would be particularly wrong if future Ministers of whichever political hue were to say that persons with disabilities could not have what they needed because of economic cutbacks. There must be some degree of continuity and consistency in this particular area. If it is not forthcoming, this or any similar Bill is unlikely to benefit the people whose needs it was intended to address or society at large. I would be grateful if the Minister were to comment on the need for continuity and consistency in his reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Sinnott case was referred to earlier. It is regrettable that some people have to go to court to seek their rights. I will say no more about it because the issue has been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> over the past couple of years. It should not happen like that. Society should not force people into a situation where they must go to court to achieve what should be an ordinary, constitutional human right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_482">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister for allowing flexibility on time. Deputy Durkan referred to resources and while the Minister is here, I make a brief suggestion which his Department might consider. Now that a certain flexibility has been recognised in the EU regarding the Stability and Growth Pact, and noting the number of new schools awaiting construction, will the Department look at the possibility of PPPs for schools?</p>
          <p eId="para_483">PPPs have been in place for some second level schools and I believe they have been successful. In areas where primary schools will be built – three have been identified in my county – comments have been made that people would favour entering an agreement with the Department to provide the money to build a school through some kind of pay-back system which would extend over a number of years. What better type of system could there be than the local community becoming involved in providing its own school on a pay-back basis? This is something the Department should consider. If the Minister thinks there is merit in the idea, we could get accountants to draw up the type of financial arrangement necessary. This would benefit the schools. At present, due to the scarcity of resources and our adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, we do not have the flexibility to provide the money to the Department to build those schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I welcome the opportunity to contribute my tuppence worth on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. Will the Minister reconsider the Bill's title? The Minister's explanatory memorandum provides a better title – Education of Children with Special Educational Needs. This title would more readily reflect the contents of the Bill. I ask the Minister to reconsider the title before Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Deputy Carey reminisced about our teaching days and the difficulties we experienced as teachers. One of the first years I spent teaching, I had 44 boys in my classroom and it was rather difficult to cope in those times. I distinctly recall the advent of a new pupil to my class who travelled every day from the local psychiatric hospital where he was a resident. He was brought to school by a psychiatric nurse every morning, deposited at my door and I delivered him back into safe hands at 3.45 p.m. I had to cope with and try to do something with him along with the other 44 boys.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I agree with Deputy Carey that the cigire, when he visited schools, was not too interested in individuals. When he visited my class, he was not very interested in this young lad. I had fourth class at the time and the cigire was interested in long division. It is remarkable that something which was so important to the cigire at the time does not appear to exist now. Pupils now do it all on their calculators. The high priority we put on such matters has disappeared. I recall how important the spelling tests used to be. They too were high on the cigire's agenda. Nowadays there is no need for all that because computers have a spellcheck which removes the need to know one's spellings at all. How priorities have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">In my short time here the number of queries and clinic calls I receive on special needs matters has grown dramatically. Parents are conscious of the needs of their children and want the best for them and there is huge demand for a level of service which will achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I commend the staff of the Minister's special education section who work under extreme difficulties. They are probably short staffed and short of resources but they are always courteous and pleasant to deal with. I hope the Minister will be able to provide the extra resources they need to overcome the difficulties in the section. Thousands of applications are waiting to be processed but the section does not have the resources to do the work. Unless the Minister can provide these resources, the applications will lie there and children whose needs have been assessed will miss out. That is not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I wish to make a special plea on behalf of a particular group of people affected by the provisions of this Bill and how they are implemented, namely school principals. Deputy Carey has been there and done that. There are two classes of primary school principals, those in a school of more than eight teachers who are referred to as walking principals and those in schools of eight teachers or less. A walking principal has the full-time job of administering the school, which is a difficult task. The school is generally fairly big, in an urban area and the principal must cope with all the associated problems. Approximately 25% of primary school principals around the country are in that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I urge the Minister to consider the school where there are seven or eight teachers. The principal in such a school must teach a full day. These principals will probably be responsible for sixth class and for preparing the pupils for second level school. They may also have to face the difficulties associated with having some pupils with special needs. On top of all that, they have the responsibility of dealing with parents, difficult children, psychological reports etc. This Bill will impose a further raft of responsibilities on these principals who will end up having to cope with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">It is easy for me to say all this but I can suggest a solution which I ask the Minister to examine. It may be a revolutionary way of looking at matters but I saw it happening in another jurisdiction where it worked well. The solution is that where a principal is working in a school which does not warrant a walking principal, the Minister should introduce an entitlement of days allocated for delivering on the responsibilities of the principal. To cope with this, a part-time teacher must be brought in to allow the principal time off to cope with the responsibilities of the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">This Bill imposes huge responsibility on principals. Section 10 states that the principal must review the special plan that is in place at least once a year to establish if the pupil is achieving the goals specified in the education plan. How can principals do this if they have to teach classes full time? When will they get the chance to meet the child to review the education plan? How will they cope with it? What is the solution? One cannot keep a child back in the evening or bring him or her in on a Saturday. One cannot leave one's class to go to another. Where will principals find the time to do it? How can they ensure it will be done? Is it fair that the system will operate in this way? Will this provision be pushed aside without attention being given to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The establishment of education plans for children with special needs is extremely important. Such plans should be carried through in the best possible way. Somebody should oversee their carrying through. When will principals in schools with between three and seven teachers get a chance to review them? How will they do it? How will they be able to report back to parents? Principals are given such a responsibility in section 10 which states "the principal shall make a report to the parents of the child concerned and the relevant special educational needs organiser of the outcome of a review". When will they do it? The Bill also states principals are responsible for the implementation of plans for children with special needs. Not only must they review such plans at least once each year but they are also responsible for implementing them. How can they do this while carrying out their responsibilities at the same time?</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The Bill contains another beautiful provision in respect of what will happen if a pupil with special needs transfers from one school to another while an education plan is in place. In such circumstances, the principal of the first school is responsible for "ensuring that the second-mentioned school is capable of implementing that plan". I challenge the Minister to explain to the House how any principal can do this. If I were a principal, I would not like to have to assess if my neighbour's school down the road could cope with a pupil's education plan. I would not like to have to say, "I do not think you can because I do not think you are up to the standard and I do not think you will be able to do it." I agree with the Minister that somebody has to ensure the school to which a pupil is moving will live up to the standards of his or her previous school but it is a very onerous responsibility. I appreciate that the Minister is interested in continuity but I am concerned about the practicalities of the proposed system which gives responsibility to principals. The Minister knows that in rural areas the principal of one school may not be on speaking terms with his or her counterpart down the road.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">Principals and deputy principals have been told by their advisers that if the Bill is enacted in full, the workload in respect of special needs pupils which is already significant will increase greatly. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this advice. I hope he will take on board the suggestion that principals in smaller schools should have access to part-time teachers who could take on their class for a certain number of hours in a day or a week. This is necessary if principals are to fulfil their responsibilities and live up to the further responsibilities being given to them in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_498">I thank the Members who contributed to the debate on the Bill this afternoon and in recent weeks. Having followed it on the monitor and in the Official Report, I have been struck by the depth of the commitment of Members on all sides of the House to trying to ensure persons with disabilities or special needs are looked after well in the education system. Anybody who reads the transcripts of this debate in the future will be struck in a similar way. I thank all Deputies on all sides for their constructive approach to the Bill. I look forward to continuing the discussion on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I appreciate that I do not have much time to respond but I would like to refer to some of the significant issues of concern raised by Deputies. I would like to address a number of the points made today. The need to make available adequate resources for the provision of services, as envisaged in the Bill, has been a consistent theme in the debate. I restate my firm belief that section 12 provides a practical solution for their concerns. It takes into account the fact that funds for education services must be approved by the House. We have to remember that there is no such thing as an open-ended Estimate in any Department. This fact is recognised by section 12 which prioritises special education in the context of the Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Despite the fact that there has not been a legal onus on us to increase expenditure on special education, there have been dramatic increases since 1998. Huge improvements have been made in the services available. The national educational psychological service, for example, has expanded beyond recognition in recent years. Many more resource teachers, special needs teachers and special learning teachers have been provided. The amount of funding for facilities for young people with special needs in schools has increased. All areas of expenditure have increased exponentially. I have calculated that well over €1 billion has been specifically dedicated to special educational needs in the last five years. Well over €300 million is expended on an annual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Many Deputies mentioned the definition of "disability". Some have questioned the reason there has been a change from the definition contained in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002 which followed closely the definition in the Education Act. The new definition of "educational disability" is preferable because it is less medically focused than the definition included in the Education Act. It is broadly similar to the definition of "disability" contained in the National Disability Authority Act. The new definition is a good one because it concentrates on the effects of disability rather than the cause. This is more appropriate in an educational setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Many Deputies want assurances about the treatment of a certain group of children. I have stated in the past that children with particular conditions, such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD, will not be denied their right to receive an assessment and individual education plan where this is necessary to meet their needs. As a result of the concerns which have been expressed, I will discuss the matter with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure this is reflected in the definition of "educational disability".</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I know many people are seriously concerned about this and we have tried to allay their fears in that regard. I ask them to accept my bona fides and those of the Department. We are not trying to deprive anyone. I would like us to tease this out on Committee Stage in a non-political manner. I understand the temptation is there and, if I was on the Opposition benches, I would be doing the same but I would like such a debate because we have had it internally in the Department. I am convinced we have it at the moment. However, I am still open if there are fears and we will consult with the parliamentary counsel because Deputies have raised this question. Nonetheless, focusing on the educational needs rather than the disability and its causes is a better way of doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The Bill will give rights in law to children with special needs and their parents which build upon the rights enumerated in the Education Act and Article 42 of the Constitution. On this Bill becoming law, children with special educational needs will have a right to an assessment, the right to an individual education plan and the right to have the services they need to ensure they can use their abilities to their greatest potential. I am not sure if we have caught the spirit of this in the Bill but we have tried to ensure the Bill does not just refer to a person's disabilities – we should enumerate a person's abilities and play to those strengths, a point made by several Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The parents will have a right to be involved and consulted at every stage of their child's development, a right to appeal decisions of the National Council for Special Education or a health board to the Special Education Appeals Board. The Bill will put in place a mechanism which will ensure no child gets left behind and where every parent can hope to achieve an education for their child which will make the best use of their abilities. We will give all children the tools necessary to engage in society on the best possible terms by ensuring they have the same right to avail of, and benefit from, appropriate education as do their peers who do not have special needs. These rights are essential for ensuring justice, equality and compassion in education into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I fully accept the necessity for continuity and for joined-up Government and Civil Service thinking in regard to people with special needs, particularly between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. We have a long way to go on this. There are provisions in the Bill which we think will take us a distance along this route and it is another area on which we can focus on Committee Stage to see if we can strengthen the mechanisms. This is crucially important, a view most Deputies share.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The Title was raised by Deputies McGrath and Stanton. I am not hung up on the Titles of Bills. There may be a better, more positive one which we can give to the Bill and we can examine it on Committee Stage. Nevertheless, we will all agree that whatever the Title of the Bill, the delivery of the service under it will be much more important. If we can make the Title more positive, that is fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I thank Deputy McGrath for his kind remarks about the staff in the special education section. I know he is not at all biased by the fact that many of them are his constituents. I share his view. They would be the first people to admit that they have at times not been able to give the service they would want to give. I particularly acknowledge the pressure under which they work. We are trying to refocus their work and, on two occasions on which we have suggested different methods and changes in focus, they moved and adapted readily, which is making a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I accept that this Bill places an onus and responsibility on school principals. I am mindful of the fact that there are probably a few school principals among the Deputies opposite.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I was just about to mention benchmarking in a different context. Most principals discharge their onerous responsibilities well. They are paid an extra amount of money for the extra duties they do and they received extra money under benchmarking. If there is a failure among school principals at the moment, it is in not using the management structures they have in the schools and not ensuring that other people who have posts of responsibility discharge fully their functions. This is often because, out of the best possible motives, they feel they have to do this job themselves. If we are failing, and it is probably a failure on the part of the Department, it is in the need for further professional and management development of principals, which has been raised by the IPPN and the INTO.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I will refer to non-administrative or walking principals. The Hay report reflected that because we have so many small schools, the vast majority of which are under four teachers, we cannot give the principal of every school the full walking principal status and I do not think we should. However, principals should mobilise their management and their posts of responsibility better than they do. That would be some help to them, although I am not saying it would solve all their problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">There is a growing tendency among teachers to get posts of responsibility and the allowances which go with them and then feel they are entitled to time off to fulfil the responsibilities. I do not accept that argument. I may lose this and have done so in conciliation and arbitration, but as far as I am concerned, people get their post of responsibility money for the extra hours they have to put in and the extra responsibility they have. I do not see why somebody should get extra pay for taking on additional duties and then seek or be entitled to time off in respect of those duties. However, that is a matter for another day. I am sure the Deputies opposite who are teachers would like to discuss it with me at a later stage.</p>
