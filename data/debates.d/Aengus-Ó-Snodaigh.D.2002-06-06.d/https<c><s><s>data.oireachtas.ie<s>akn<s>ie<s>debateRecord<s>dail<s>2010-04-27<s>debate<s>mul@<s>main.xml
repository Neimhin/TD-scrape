            <p eId="para_5">Of the 164 civil servants serving in my Department, 31 have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme.  The breakdown by grade is, assistant principal, seven; higher executive officer, four; administrative officer, three; executive officer, five; staff officer, one; and clerical officer, 11.  Some 31 former members of staff have already been assigned to decentralised posts.  There are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis.  It is a matter for those Departments to which staff from my Department have decentralised to assign such staff to locations outside Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_8">What is the status of the 35 locations which are to be reviewed next year?  The Taoiseach is aware that on foot of a decentralisation implementation group report, authorisation was given for decentralisation to go ahead at certain locations, with other locations to be reviewed in 2011.  What is the status of that review?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_9">Detailed questions on policy positions and issues regarding individual locations should be referred to the Department of Finance, which handles this matter.  The general position is as outlined by Deputy Kenny.  There are locations which are being proceeded with.  It has been announced that other locations will be reviewed in 2011.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_10">In light of the manner in which the categories and numbers may stack up, does the Taoiseach believe that the 2011 review will result in any of these locations being approved?  Given the current constraints on spending, does he believe decentralisation will go ahead at those locations?  I would like to bring a symptom of this botched decentralisation plan to his attention.  The Office of Public Works has been relocated to Trim, County Meath.  I fully respect that.  Every weekday, a bus leaves Dublin Castle to bring OPW staff to work in Trim.  It brings them back to Dublin Castle in the evening.</p>

            <p eId="para_12">That adds two hours to the daily travel of staff.  The total cost of the development of the Trim site was €37.5 million.  The site cost €5 million and the construction of the OPW facility cost €32 million.  The OPW office in St. Stephen's Green has not yet been vacated because a large cohort of staff, including four of the six principal architects, do not want to relocate.  It was intended that a further 180 staff would move to Kanturk andClaremorris, although a final decision on the matter has been deferred until next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">Some staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will move into the OPW building in 2010, which will save €1.5 million.  At a time when we are all talking about environmental savings, etc., is the Taoiseach happy that a bus leaves Dublin Castle every morning to go up and down to Trim?  Does the Taoiseach consider that to be satisfactory?</p>

            <p eId="para_20">I am asking the Head of Government about the status of the 2011 review.  I have mentioned a symptom of bad planning in respect of decentralisation to County Meath.  I respect the staff of the Office of Public Works, who do a very good job in the work that they do.  I will mention another example.  The former Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, agreed that the Department should be relocated to Knock Airport.  Planning went ahead and was agreed.  An objection was made by An Bord Pleanála but it was knocked.  Knock, knock.  As a sort of medium-term solution, the Minister transferred the staff in question to Tubbercurry, in a warehouse that is unsuitable according to today's standards.  It then agreed that they should go to Charlestown.</p>

            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_18">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_22">Nothing has happened there.  There is a vacant building in Kiltimagh which was built for office purposes, where there are considerable savings to be made.  These are issues which we rarely have time to articulate in the House.  It seems as if the implementation review group needs to do a lot of work.  There are major anomalies and ill-thought out situations now becoming very obvious under the decentralisation programme.  In respect of that kind of situation, is the implementation group hearing observations about how things are not working and how they may be able to work better?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_23">I cannot comment on specific cases.  Before the decentralisation programme, a substantial amount of commuting was done by people who travelled long distances.  It is now very much offset by the fact that there are decentralised offices in other parts of the country.  People who have to come to Dublin or live here can now return to and work from home.  That greatly offsets any examples the Deputy may be able to provide about people who may have to travel in the other direction.  It has been a reality for many people in the public service, regardless of whether it is decentralised.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">I again point out that the property costs have been offset by savings and reallocations of property by the Office of Public Works to other schemes.  I understand, from the previous replies which have been given, that has been more than offset.  The Department of Finance can outline the exact information on all schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">The Western Development Commission did a study on the beneficial impact of decentralised offices in various parts of the country, in particular the west.  It noted the economic impact of relocation of the jobs to the western region as being positive and significant.  Public sector employees have taken up opportunities to relocate to the western region for quality of life issues, in particular the many benefits realised by easier commuting to work.  The western region offers many advantages in terms of cost savings and benefits from living within a close community, being closer to family and living in a rural location.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">The wider impacts in Tubbercurry were also deemed to be significant and the relocation of that Department has raised the profile of the area and encouraged new business.  Those who work in the general community development area would not agree with the Deputy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_20">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_27">I have a final point.  While I respect the findings of that report, without being parochial is a decision likely to be made in respect of the Charlestown position?  The former Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs made a decision to move the Department to Knock.  It was refused by the planning appeals board.  He did send them to Tubbercurry.  There is a limbo operating at the moment.  If the Taoiseach does not have the information now he might send it on to me.  Is a decision likely to be made in respect of the commitment given by the former Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in respect of the location in Charlestown?  Will it now go into the 2011 review?  The numbers——</p>

            <p eId="para_31">On the last occasion we had this round of questions I asked the Taoiseach if he could give any breakdown for the total number of people who have been decentralised to date, compared to those who had moved from Dublin to a location outside it, and those who had moved from one location outside Dublin to another.  On that occasion the Taoiseach undertook to make some inquiries.  Is he in a position to tell the House the breakdown of those two categories?</p>

            <p eId="para_43">The cost of the bus is not covered in the supplementary information either.  The ability to anticipate goes way beyond my expectations.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">It has been a feature of how the service has been, is and probably will be organised in the future where people commute long distances to hold down jobs in the public service.  Decentralisation has provided a welcome opportunity for many people, both those from Dublin who wished to return to the city or those who wished to go to a part of the country they had not inhabited in the past.  Everyone I have met at various times in whatever capacity has been happy with the relocations that took place.  The OPW has provided workplace environments comparable to any one would expect anywhere and it has, in many cases, improved the work environment for staff who had to operate in less suitable surroundings in the past, which is one of the reasons the decentralisation process was undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">In this phase of the programme, approximately 4,000 people will be relocated with 3,100 having been relocated so far.  Due to the change in the financial situation, a review is to take place regarding the remaining staff who were not in the process of being moved in this phase.  The review will take place in 2011.  Decentralisation has taken place to almost 40 locations to date.  Full completion of the projects under way and approved will result in approximately 4,000 moves overall.  The moves to Buncrana, County Donegal, and Trim, County Meath, are under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">The Wexford building for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been finished and the transfer of staff from the existing advance office in Wexford has commenced.  During this month, staff based in Dublin moved to Wexford.  It is expected that the Newbridge building for the Department of Defence will be completed by the end of May or early June and staff moves will commence shortly thereafter.  The project in Roscommon town has just commenced and it is hoped projects in Tipperary town, where a preferred tender has been selected, and Portlaoise will commence this year.  The total expenditure on the property aspects of the programme to the end of December last year was €338 million.  That amount is comprised of the cost of the sites, property acquisition, fit-out works and rent of approximately €330 million expended by the Office of Public Works, OPW, together with €7 million incurred directly in respect of property costs by other organisations.  Approximately €17.7 million has been spent to the end of last year on the cost of renting and fitting out properties in advance party locations.  Staff in such locations will remain in place or move to permanent accommodation under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">The property costs have been offset by savings in the reallocation of property by the OPW to other schemes at the end of 2008 valued in the region of €550 million.  Of that amount more than €350 million relates to the disposal of high-value sites at the height of the property market.  The potential for future receipts is more limited.  In addition, property valued at €75 million was transferred to the affordable homes partnership.  The OPW has also agreed joint venture development schemes with a value of approximately €125 million subject to volatility in the property market.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">As expected, non-property costs are being provided as more advance accommodation is in place, staff training is increased and the moves have taken place.  Total expenditure on non-property costs at the end of September 2009 for all decentralising organisations was approximately €15 million.  The spend to date on staffing costs according to the OPW on the property aspects of the programme was €12.6 million.  That is as much information as I have on that aspect of the matter.</p>

If I am correct, a ballpark figure for total cost to date is somewhere between €700 million and €750 million but perhaps I missed something.  The supplementary I asked was whether the Taoiseach could give a figure for total costs to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I do not have that sort of information.  The purpose of the decentralisation programme was to provide people with opportunities.  For some, it involves a change of location.  For others, it involves a change of Department.  In some cases it will involve moving from one Department to another within the city while others might have availed of promotional opportunities and moved down the country.  The bottom line is that over the period in question, 4,000 people will be relocated under the first phase of the decentralisation programme.  Currently, approximately 3,100 staff are <i>in situ</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">Noting that a review of the decentralisation programme is scheduled for next year, 2011, has there been an overall assessment of the success or otherwise of the relocations that have taken place since the programme was first announced by the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy?  If I recall correctly, there were two particular pillars behind the proposition; one was to aid the objective of offering a boost or an impetus to local economies in towns and cities elsewhere in the State than Dublin and, second, by the transfer of a significant number of public servants that there would be some impact in terms of congestion in the city of Dublin.  By transferring a significant number of public servants, there was to be some impact on congestion in the city of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">With regard to the success or otherwise under either measure, or any other measures that may have been highlighted but which I cannot recall, has there been any assessment made over the period in question?  If I interpreted the Taoiseach's reply correctly, he indicated that in the order of 4,000 relocations have taken place.  Have there been any relocations associated directly with his Department over the period in question?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_41">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_58">With regard to relocations pertaining to any area of my Department under the programme, there are 31 staff with applications in the central applications facility who are available to relocate, subject to the usual criteria.  There have been a number of reports.  The decentralisation implementation group has provided a series of reports updating the information on the progress being made, the issues that arise and the constraints and difficulties that have been encountered.  As the Deputy is aware, industrial relations issues arose that deferred the speedy implementation of the programme.  It was always a voluntary programme and issues must be dealt with as they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">As a result of the deteriorating financial situation generally in the country, a review was announced in terms of proceeding with the existing phase involving 4,000 relocations and considering the situation thereafter.  That review, to be conducted by the Department of Finance, will give us an opportunity in 2011 to determine the position at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">The original programme was highly ambitious and included State agencies.  Industrial relations problems arose but the State agency issues have been deferred until the review takes place.  There are many things happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">When talking about the benefits of the programme, one should note decentralisation can provide good-quality jobs for the regions.  Existing civil servants who wish to leave Dublin are facilitated to do so if they want to do so for career or other reasons.  There is a wider range of work and career opportunities for civil servants already working outside Dublin as a result of the programme.  Thus, there is greater choice and greater opportunities for promotion.  Present and future civil servants who aspire to senior management positions will no longer have to migrate necessarily to the capital although many will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The dispersal of jobs has obvious advantages in terms of securing a better regional balance.  It helps the economic and social development of chosen centres and their catchment areas and provides a further boost in the provision of infrastructure in the regions.  It can also attract other investments and services and act as an incentive to entrepreneurs to develop businesses in the regions, thus creating a positive domino effect.  Public service decentralisation offers some distinct benefits that other similarly sized investment projects might not deliver, such as the potential to become a national policy-making location.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">With regard to the decentralisation programme over the past couple of years, particularly over the past 18 months, one detects there is a slowing up in the roll-out of the proposals across the various Departments and State agencies.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether there are actual proposals, announced previously in this Chamber and elsewhere, that are currently suspended because of the current economic difficulties we are all facing?  If he is in a position to answer this, will he state whether there is a timeframe within which any of those suspended or deferred proposals may be considered for reassessment, re-introduction or reactivation?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_64">As I said earlier, moves to Buncrana and Trim are under way at present.  I have given the update on the Wexford situation and Newbridge, and the projects in Roscommon town, Tipperary town and Portlaoise are ongoing.  Advance teams were sent to two locations where the buildings were not yet ready.  Such advance teams are, in themselves, viable and may be augmented in the future as required if there is a demand or if this suits the manner in which the programme should be rolled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">State agencies account for about 2,300 or 20% of the programme in terms of numbers.  The pace has been slow here, with a number of inter-related factors serving to frustrate progress.  However, much progress has been made and many creative solutions have been found to ensure that decentralisation can proceed, and indeed to meet staff demand in terms of those who wish to relocate as soon as possible and are prepared to look positively at interim solutions pending the full programme being rolled out in their particular location.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">The first and pilot phase of the organisational review programme, ORP, involved the undertaking of comprehensive reviews of the capacities of three Departments, with particular reference to strategy, managing delivery and evaluation, and the production by them of follow-up action plans.  The Departments reviewed were Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">The first phase was completed in November 2008 with the publication of a composite report which was lodged in the Oireachtas Library.  The report includes the findings on each Department, the follow-up action plans prepared by them and a chapter on the challenges for the wider Civil Service arising from the research.  The second phase of reviews under the organisational review programme is now nearing completion.  This phase involves detailed examination of the capacities of four further Government organisations, the Department of Health and Children, the Central Statistics Office, the Property Registration Authority and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The review of Revenue is almost finalised and the other three reviews have been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">The current position is that the management boards of the Department of Health and Children, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority are working on follow-up action plans.  I expect that these plans, along with that from Revenue, will be completed in around four to six weeks.  A composite report, containing the findings on each organisation and their follow-up action plans, will be published shortly afterwards, following consideration by Government.  Regarding the third and next phase of reviews, preparatory work is already under way.  The capacities of another four Departments will be examined, namely, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Science, Foreign Affairs and my own Department.  I expect these reviews and the associated action plans to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">Regarding the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a review under the ORP has not yet been carried out.  Regarding a<b> </b>review of the Department of Finance, a decision has yet to be made on the organisations to be included in the fourth phase of ORP reviews which are due to commence at the end of this year.  Deputies can be assured that the ORP reviews constitute very thorough examinations of the capacities of Government Departments and offices.  They involve considerable stakeholder engagement and, in that regard, I would like to record my appreciation to those members of Oireachtas committees who took the time to meet the ORP review teams and provide them with valuable input.</p>

Would it not strike him as a serious situation if that actually is the case?  It is something that should not be tolerated in any Department let alone one as critical as the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">Can the Taoiseach confirm, as is reported, that the particular report concerning that Department finds confusion among staff as to its role and the lack of clarity around who its customers are, coupled with the feeling of being constantly under fire, are factors contributing to poor morale?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that this is part of the programme report on the Department?  How can it be that there is confusion among staff about the Department's role?  This is what the review programme report allegedly states.  Can the Taoiseach specify when this issue became known?  Did it coincide with the establishment of the HSE?  We have not yet seen the report; when will it be published?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this confusion must reflect the so-called policy — that is another debate entirely — of the Government and the Department, as espoused——</p>

If this cannot happen within the Department, can they be redeployed to some other area, or even to the HSE?  God forbid we add any more bureaucracy to that organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">Some of the findings of the report in question, which has not yet been published, featured in the media recently, although much of the contextual information and balancing comments did not appear in these articles, and other findings were not commented upon at all.  An operational review programme is a management tool to help assess the capacity of Departments and major offices to meet challenges over the coming years.  It can be used by Departments to help them improve their performance — in fact, this is the whole idea.  The report has been welcomed by the Secretary General and action plans are being prepared in response.  We will accept the critiques of aspects of the Department's work and see how they can be improved.  Having served in that Department myself, I acknowledge that the staff show much ability and commitment in dealing with a difficult agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">The report identifies areas in which improvement is required, and clarifying roles and responsibilities is an important aspect of this.  As in every field, it is important to have a clear objective and that management and staff are behind this.  The Department is now mainly in the business of policy formation, but when I was there, before the establishment of the HSE, it also had an operational role and was trying to deal with hospital services and every other aspect of the health service on a day-to-day basis through what was then a regionalised health board system.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">It must be objectively acknowledged there have been improvements, including the establishment of the National Hospitals Office and so on, and there has been an effort to pull things together to make a far more coherent and joined-up organisation.  This may be seen in terms of improvements in operational performance.  Of course there are service pressures and organisational problems.  When one can find the right people in the right place, one sees a different level of performance in some places compared to others.  That is not to say that everyone is starting from the same mark or that people have the same sets of problems but we all know the degree to which the health service is interactive between primary, secondary and tertiary care.  We need good local organisational efforts as well as a centralised approach that brings clarity to the policies and enables people to get on with the job as effectively as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Mention was made of managing delivery by agencies through stronger goals and output and performance measurement, as was more clearly defining customers and stakeholders and a closer alignment to serving them more appropriately.  It is not a question of the Department being unaware that it exists to serve the public; it is a matter of ensuring that the many agencies and organisations which are delivering health services have a proper relationship that maximises effectiveness and allows people to work as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">I do not think any review worth its salt would be able to give a clean bill of health to every organisation.  If it did, it might suffer from the criticism that it was not a very rigorous or robust exercise.  The review is seen as a management tool or a SWAT analysis which evaluates how services are being delivered, the extent to which the Department is fulfilling its role, its place in the delivery of services and, in this case, how one organises the services and how agencies meet their remits and responsibilities.  That is the purpose of an operational review programme.  Everyone in this House would rightly point to the need for periodic objective and robust exercises to assess how people are performing.</p>

In February, the Department of Health and Children indicated that it had been asked to prepare an action plan which was to be presented to the Government before the end of March or the beginning of April.  Has that plan been presented now that we are in the last week of April?  Will the reports of the four Departments and offices addressed by the organisational review programme be published as indicated and, if so, how soon does the Taoiseach expect their publication so that we can focus on some of the questions I raised earlier, including the serious issue of poor morale among staff in the Department of Health and Children?

Given that the report on the Department of Health and Children, which is pretty damning, was already published in <i>The Irish Times</i>, would he agree to simply publish the reports on that Department and the other three agencies considered in the first round rather than wait for the action plans to be drawn up?</p>

For that reason, it is best to await publication of the full reports and the associated action plans by the Departments, after consideration by the Government, so that people can see the full picture and what is being suggested as the response or how we will improve those areas that have been identified.  People can then have an informed discussion on that basis.</p>

As I stated in reply to Deputy Gilmore earlier, we should see the full report and response from the Department before coming to an informed view.  It is important that these rigorous and robust exercises point up issues that must be addressed.  I would expect the action plans to address any issues raised in terms of priorities in which the Department should engage and in what way it organises and gives the workloads to the various sections of the Departments, which can vary from time to time depending on what problems or issues arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">On the Department of Finance, the fourth review will come up at the end of the year in terms of deciding what Departments will be involved.

        [16854/10]

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_65">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_106">The objective of the one-stop shop commitment in the next generation broadband policy paper "Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland" is to facilitate telecommunications network operators in gaining access to ducting that exists along publicly-owned energy, transport and other infrastructure to help reduce the cost of fibre roll-out for backhaul networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Government policy is to make available all State-owned infrastructure on an open-access basis in so far as is possible.  I do not favour exclusive deals being done whereby one telecommunications company secures exclusive access to a particular State-owned network.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">An important step in delivering on this commitment is the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010, which provides that the National Roads Authority, NRA, is the single point of contact for access to ducts on motorways and other national roads.  This means that telecommunications service providers no longer must approach individual local authorities when seeking such access.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The legislation also allows the NRA to make a scheme, which will permit it to impose charges for the use of ducts subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport following consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Finance.  I am satisfied that this will provide an open and transparent way of setting access pricing for NRA infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">I understand the NRA has engaged expertise to assist in developing this new business and that it has been meeting with service providers as part of this process.  I very much welcome this development as it is an example of what I set out to achieve in facilitating open access to State-owned ducting.  Such open access is a clear policy objective of mine.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">The NRA model is a significant advance and I will seek to extend this approach to other suitable State-owned infrastructure.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_112">Not only am I surprised by the Minister's answer, but I am quite worried by it.  We have been waiting for nearly a year for a progress report on the promised one-stop shop for State-owned broadband services to facilitate those investing in broadband in Ireland and piggy-backing on investment the State has made, whether in fibre, in ducting or in whatever infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">The Minister has confirmed today that the NRA will be the one-stop shop and it will deal only with ducting infrastructure.  Is it the case that he has given up on the project of bringing together all the State-owned infrastructure?  He has now provided this information on the Department's website so it is clear to see who owns what.  The purpose was to achieve a co-ordinated approach so that people could use one portal to establish how they could use and benefit from State-owned infrastructure.  His reply to my question seems to imply the Minister has abandoned this concept, with the exception of the NRA dealing with the ducting infrastructure.  Is this the case?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_67" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_114">No.  It is a case of evolving what is being done in the NRA and applying it to other suitable infrastructure.  The NRA and the roads network is the most extensive network for rolling out open access fibre ducting so it is significant and important.  However, it is not the only measure which is being progressed and neither is it the only development related to State assets.  For example, there is significant deployment of fibre along the gas pipelines and electricity wires.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">The question as to whether the one-stop shop will include all State infrastructure, including what are now commercial entities operating within the commercial market, is a valid question.  We have to be careful.  In my view, it is better to develop those assets not currently in the commercial market and where there may not be a commercial business case for the agency to work with them and to provide the one-stop shop to ensure those non-utilised assets become available.  I do not believe it would be right to bring together every single piece of State infrastructure at this time — including those already operating within a commercial market — and to apply a common approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">This is the difficulty.  At this point and subject to ongoing negotiation with TIF, it would not be appropriate for us to bring every single piece of State ducting infrastructure together but in cases where the potential for ducting is not being utilised, we will try to make that available. We are dealing with a market and we must be careful that any State actions support investment rather than undermine it.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">The Minister is saying the one-stop shop now only applies to ducting.  Less than two months ago he stated that such a management system would facilitate the wider objective of promoting co-operation between different telecom providers for backhaul and wholesale services.  This now seems to be nonsense.  Am I correct in interpreting what the Minister is saying as being that the one-stop shop he refers to is solely confined to ducting and that the level of his ambition to date is asking the NRA to co-ordinate the marketing and use of ducting infrastructure which it has already constructed?</p>

         the reason the tender process for a postcode system has been suspended; if he has read the report on postcodes of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; if he will take on board the recommendation of that report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_127">An invitation to tender was issued on 29 January 2010 for consultants to assist in selecting a body to implement and maintain a postcode system.  The tender competition closed on 12 March 2010.  Subsequently, a technical issue arose relating to the consistency of the request for tenders with the requirements of the public procurement regulations.  The issue arose internally in the Department and was not raised by any of the outside interested parties.  Bidders were notified by letter of the cancellation of the tender and a notice to that effect was posted on the e-tenders website on 15 April 2010.  A request for tender will be re-issued by my Department this week.  The need to issue a new tender will have a limited impact on the timeline for the roll-out of the postcode system.  It remains my objective to roll out the system by the end of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">I have received and read the joint committee's report on postcodes, which is currently being reviewed by my Department.  The report makes a series of recommendations relating to the design and implementation of a national postcode system.  These include proposals for future-proofing of system design; the publication of a road map for implementation later this year; clarification of issues arising in relation to data protection; the promotion of postcode usage and the retention of familiar and well-used addresses.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">Consideration of the details of the report is currently ongoing in my Department.  This includes seeking clarification on legal issues raised by the joint committee.  I will be happy to reply to the committee in full, as requested, when this is complete.</p>

I was rapporteur for the committee and it was unanimously agreed to publish this report and recommend to the Minister that he adopt a particular approach.  I am a little unhappy at his response in terms of what he considers to be the issue raised in the report.  Will the Minister agree the key issue and the main recommendation is to have a unique identifier system compatible with GPS?  Such a system would have significant benefits across the board.  Will he state whether he plans to continue with this new tendering process with the old model of using a cluster of properties rather than using the unique identifier system?  I urge him to use the opportunity of this delay.  In his initial statement he said that it would be in early 2011 and now he refers to the end of 2011.  If this gives us a better system I am quite happy to go along with that.  However, the main point to be stressed — the Minister did not clarify it and I am concerned he is avoiding it — is whether he will pursue the unique identifier option.  Does he intend to talk to the Data Protection Commissioner as soon as possible in order to ensure the issue of data protection is cleared up?  Is he satisfied the approach he has adopted in the past of using the cluster of up to 50 houses, is appropriate to the needs of today?</p>

            <p eId="para_133">My understanding in earlier statements was that there was opposition.  I welcome political support across the House for a post code and a location code.  I have consistently said we must have both.  In reply to the Deputy's question, there has to be a system that provides a unique household identifier.  It might not be just a household but it could also include other street infrastructure which will require a code, such as locating a bus stop.  A location code is another example of the benefits of this system.  I have always planned to have a code which provides for an efficient postal service and also includes those location code characteristics.  In my discussions with a number of parties I have consistently examined how this can be achieved.  With the adoption of the post code model recommended by the body set up to suggest the model and by the use of additional digits it is possible to get such a locational code down to the building.  Over the past two years I have had a couple of meetings with the Data Protection Commissioner on exactly the issue raised in the joint committee report which I welcome.  The concerns originally expressed by the Data Protection Commissioner in 2006 regarding privacy are valid concerns.  These concerns can be addressed in a way that allows the development of a location code while at the same time maintaining privacy where appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">This sounds like a real mishmash.  Frankly, I would not support a proposal that adopts an old technology pretending it is a new technology.  Will the Minister accept the costs involved in having a clustering system, and maintaining it because of new build and old buildings being demolished, is a costly approach?</p>
            <p eId="para_135">If we can clear the data protection issue, the technology is available to have a unique-identifier system which would generate enormous benefits not least to Departments, but also to the emergency services and others.  It is all contained in the report which I do not need to restate.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">Will the Minister try not to straddle both sides on this matter?  I would have more respect for him if he said he was sticking with the cluster system.  While I may not agree with such a decision, at least it would be a position.  To have two systems, however, on top of each other is nonsensical.</p>

        <b>Deputy Simon Coveney</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         the plans he has in place to facilitate the roll out of commercial digital terrestrial television, DTT, should the consortium (details supplied) fail to reach agreement with RTE and the broadcasting regulator. 
        [16855/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_97" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_152">Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for RTE to develop a free-to-view digital broadcasting service as a replacement for the national analogue television service offering access to RTE 1, RTE 2, TV3 and TG4 and for the subsequent closure of the national analogue television service.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">The Act also provides opportunities for the development of a commercial digital terrestrial television, DTT, service.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, an independent regulatory authority, is required to provide for the development of commercial DTT services.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The BAI's predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, initiated a competition for a commercial DTT service provider.  The highest placed consortium withdrew from the process in April 2009.  As a result, negotiations commenced with the next placed bidder, OneVision, which are still ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">As stated in earlier replies to this question, I am not prepared to speculate or hypothesise on the outcome of what is a commercial licensing process which is a matter for the independent regulator, the BAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">I have made it clear to the authority that I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible so that clarity and certainty with regard to commercial DTT can be provided to broadcasters and viewers alike.  However, the legislation does not provide for a role for me, as Minister, in the competition process for a commercial DTT service.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">My priority, in accordance with national policy is to provide for the closure, in 2012, of the analogue free-to-view broadcasting service.  The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch-off across Europe and the Council of Ministers has asked member states to complete switch over by 2012 in so far as possible.  It is my intention that this switch off will be no later than the last quarter in 2012.  RTE is aware of this and is supportive of the deadline for analogue switch-off.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">In this regard, and in the continuing absence of commercial DTT, I recently signed an order, S.I. No. 85/2010, RTE (National Television Multiplex) Order, under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requiring RTE to launch a free-to-view DTT service to approximately 90% of the population by 31 October 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">The 2009 Act also requires RTE to provide the full national free-to-view digital service, capable of carrying RTE 1, RTE 2, TG4 and TV3, by the end of 2011, or such date as I may specify.  I have informed RTE the date for the provision of a national service is 31 December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_161">From a broadcaster perspective, the development of DTT services provides more for television viewers in terms of choice and services.  The RTE multiplex has sufficient space for eight to ten TV channels, radio channels and electronic programme guides and the legislation provides for RTE to exploit space on the multiplex for commercial purposes.  A second RTE multiplex, provided for under the 2009 Act, provides for RTE to roll out high definition, HD, services which will also be made available to TV viewers in Ireland on a free-to-view basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">More significantly, there are considerable economic benefits for Ireland resulting from the switch off of the analogue broadcast services and the consequent release and reuse of this valuable spectrum, which is known as the digital dividend.  The digital dividend is a clear enabler of economic and social growth.  By extrapolating from a recent European study, the value of the digital dividend to Ireland is expected to be between €2 billion and €10 billion, over 15 years.  In this regard, it is vital for Ireland's economic health that this spectrum is released as early as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">I raised this issue more than a year ago because I was concerned the tendering process to provide a commercial DTT service was collapsing, following the pull-out of Boxer which had won the competition.  I am not asking the Minister to interfere with the competitive tendering process.  However, will he recognise the tendering process put in place two years ago to ensure a commercial DTT operation and to facilitate the viability of a free-to-air service will not achieve this?</p>
            <p eId="para_164">It is my understanding the negotiations between OneVision and RTE have broken down.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">When does the Minister intend to intervene to put a new policy structure in place to get commercial DTT multiplexes up and running?

            <p eId="para_177">The first two preferred bidders in the tendering process established by the legislation are out of the game.  Will the Minister confirm he expects the BAI to move on to the third best bidder?  It may not have been a chosen operator at all but, because it was the last man standing, it could potentially be the next operator of commercial multiplexes.  That is not the way to roll out digital television.  The Minister needs to ask the BAI if it is satisfied that it has exhausted the tendering process set up by the previous Government and how it should deal with the matter as time is running out.  At what stage will the Minister have that meeting or will he continue to keep his head in the sand while the system collapses?</p>

            <p eId="para_178">I have had a series of meetings with all parties involved on the State side including the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Networks company and ComReg, which has had a role in this on the spectrum side.  At all stages I have done that on the basis of trying to get an outcome.  I regret that that outcome has not come quicker and that the negotiations have taken so long.  I have said that repeatedly in the House.  However, my response cannot be to get involved in the middle of what could be a difficult legal and commercial process.  That would only draw it out longer.  I have said to all parties at a certain point that when it comes down to the commercial negotiations it is up to the BAI, RTE and the other parties to work through that.  It would be wrong and improper if the Minister took on the negotiating position.  It must follow the legislative course and if that comes to an end, we will act but we have made it clear that regardless of that process the switch off will occur at the end of 2012.  That is certain, and that gives me confidence that we will get an outcome that will work.</p>

         the initiatives he plans to take to encourage mutable providers of electric transport charging infrastructure to facilitate competing solutions and implementation; the progress that has been made on setting up new memorandums of understanding with car manufactures in the same way that has been done with a company (details supplied).

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_113" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_183">The Government has set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which equates to around 225,000 vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">Electric vehicles are an increasingly realistic option to the challenge of reducing the transport sector's greenhouse gas emissions and reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  There is now very significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest internationally in Ireland's decision to be an early mover in this field.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test-bed, particularly in terms of network infrastructure development.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">In the European Union context, electric vehicles are now firmly on the EU energy policy agenda.  We agreed at the informal meeting of energy Ministers in Seville last January that electric vehicles technology and common standards should be progressed by the European Union as part of delivery of energy efficient and low carbon systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">Reflecting these discussions, the Commission is currently finalising a policy communication on green vehicles, which will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">The Energy Council of Ministers has also recently agreed to the inclusion of electric vehicles as a priority technology sector under the strategic energy technology plan.  ESB, through its membership of Eurelectric, is also playing a leading role in work by European utilities and car manufacturers to progress essential technical standardisation across Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">On 12 April last I signed an agreement with the Renault Nissan alliance and ESB which underpins Ireland as one of the European leaders in electric transport.  The agreement, building on the memorandum of understanding last year, includes the development of a national electric car charging infrastructure, the continued sharing of technical and market data between the parties and the early supply of electric cars into the Irish market by Renault and Nissan from next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">Under the agreement, ESB will roll out 1,500 charge points nationwide by December 2011.  The roll-out has already begun in Dublin and charging points will also be installed in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  ESB also plans to install 30 fast charge points across Ireland by the end of 2011, with nine expected to be set up by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">Progress has been made in discussions with other major motor manufacturers to make early production vehicles available to the Irish market and I expect that other agreements will be developed in the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">My Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and ESB Networks are also discussing the electric vehicle infrastructure network build out programme including cost recovery and access arrangements.  The potential emergence of other parties with an interest in providing infrastructure is an issue for consideration in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">There is general agreement to the principle that the infrastructure being provided by ESB Networks will be non-exclusive and it will be readily accessible by all electricity supply companies.  The infrastructure will need to be built on an open access basis to avoid needless duplication of charging points.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">We already have a number of incentives in place which demonstrate the Government's commitment to promoting electric vehicles in Ireland.  The VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the VRT reliefs of up to €2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles, which were due to end in December 2010, have been extended in the budget for a further two year period.  At the launch of the agreement last week, I announced the introduction of a grant scheme for up to 6,000 vehicles over a two year period from January 2011, which will provide grants of up to €5,000 for full battery electric vehicles and up to €2,500 for plug in hybrid electric vehicles.  The grant scheme will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and full details will be published well in advance of the scheme commencement date of January 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The support schemes are non-exclusive and will be open to any vehicle from any manufacturer which meets the qualifying criteria.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_196">I support what the Minister is trying to do in terms of making the transition from combustion engine cars to electric transport and mainstreaming that technology, and that mindset, to ensure people realise we can have normal family cars that are comfortable, powerful and safe but which are driven on batteries on the Irish electricity grid rather than by imported fossil fuels.  I question the Minister's approach, however, and want to ask him a number of direct questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">First, why is it the case that even though we have had a memorandum of understanding with Renault-Nissan, and ESB, for many months we do not have a second memorandum of understanding with any other car manufacturers, despite the fact that has been promised for over six months and that almost every car manufacturer on the globe is planning to roll out electric vehicles?  Why have we put in place a memorandum of understanding with one of them, Renault-Nissan, but not any others?</p>
            <p eId="para_198">The second question is more important.  I commend ESB for its involvement in this area but I am concerned that we are creating a monopoly here in what is probably the most exciting industry area that will develop rapidly in the next ten years whereby ESB is the only body providing charging infrastructure, and the technology around that technology, for electric cars.  Why is that the case?  Would the Minister consider issuing a global tender on behalf of the Government for expressions of interest in providing solutions to put in place an ambitious charging infrastructure to facilitate the complete transition he envisages in the next 20 years?  Why has he resisted that approach to try to get the best technology into Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_200">On the two questions, first, our intention is to bring in a number of different motor car companies to provide vehicles for this market as it evolves.  I believe further agreements will be signed with other companies.  I had a meeting with Mitsubishi recently and it seemed to me that we are close to signing an agreement with that company, among others.  The real success we have had is getting some of these leading companies to come here because, to be honest, there is a limited number of vehicles available in the world.  Our objective was to try to get some of them to develop the activity here first and the economic benefits that come with that in terms of the spin-off industries that will develop the charging points, the software systems, the payment systems and the management systems that will be needed to make this work.  We are open to dealing with other companies.  We have always made this a neutral development in that all car companies are welcome as long as the technology is compatible.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">The issue is the same on the grid.  We are not looking to restrict other companies in terms of developing charge point infrastructure.  It has to be a common design, however.  One action that is happening, and in fairness to ESB it has been leading it, is in regard to Eurelectric.  We are looking to get agreement across Europe, and in other parts of the world, on a common type charging infrastructure to ensure the cars come with a standard recharging mechanism.  One of the reasons for doing that is that it is non-restrictive.  It is not creating a monopoly.  It is opening up the market to other companies to provide similar infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">I hope the Minister will accept that I would welcome new memoranda of understanding with companies like Mitsubishi and, I hope, many others.  My main concern is regarding charging infrastructure.  The Minister said there is no obstacle to other potential operators of charging infrastructure as long as they all abide by the requirement for standard plugs and so on.  That is obvious.  We must have the same plug to allow us switch from one system to another but we should be encouraging a non-standardised approach towards clever charging systems tailored for different usages.  For example, the position of a TD who might drive 50,000 miles a year will be entirely different from that of an elderly person who drives to the shop three or four times a week.  We want to encourage competition and new solutions from companies like Better Place and another half dozen that currently provide interesting, exciting solutions in other parts of the world.  We want them all testing in Ireland and competing with ESB to ensure we get the best technology solutions for Irish consumers.  We are saying there is no obstacle to inviting that into Ireland but we are asking ESB to do the job.  I would like to see ESB tested and competed with to ensure we get the best possible solutions.  That will probably be through an ESB dominated charging grid but if we do not invite those other tenders we will not be able to get the benefits of competition.</p>

            <p eId="para_203">I agree with the Deputy.  I met with Shai Agassi of Better Place, one of the companies the Deputy mentioned, and said that we are open in that regard.  This is new technology but we are at the frontier.  We are the first country to put this out on a nationwide basis.  This is one of the locations to which people will come to try to test out these systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">In terms of the way this will develop and what ESB has agreed to, it is not exclusive to any one company to put in meters but in regard to its meters, we are saying it should be open to other suppliers also to use those charging points.  Even though ESB might put in an extra piece of infrastructure, it would be on an open access basis in that another supply company could come in and provide some of the innovation or charging flexibility the Deputy mentioned.  I believe the characteristics of this technology will work best when the network is more open and accessible to different technological solutions, be it a project like Better Place coming in with a battery changing system or a——</p>

This is a global call from Ireland that we are going to develop this technology and inviting companies to test different systems here because we believe we will achieve economic benefit on the back of this.</p>

        <b>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         if he is satisfied that Gate 3 can adequately deal with new wind farm proposals to get grid connection in a timely manner.

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_121" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_208">The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has statutory responsibility for grid connection offers and for oversight of EirGrid's grid connection process, including the Gate process for renewable energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">The CER decision on the Gate 3 round provides for connection offers for 4,000 MWs of renewable electricity capacity.  Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity, including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  The Gate 3 decisions, combined with the existing renewable capacity and projects currently being built and connected, point to the 40% target being met and even exceeded by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">Ireland's national renewable energy action plan, which is to be submitted to the EU Commission by next June, will set out the detailed projections and strategies to achieve the national target.  The plan is being developed in consultation with the renewable sector and all stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">The projects in Gate 3 were selected by the CER on a "first come, first served" criterion.  Grid connection offers for projects within the Gate 3 process began to issue in December last year and will continue to issue on a phased basis until mid-2011.  The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER.  Through public consultation and dedicated industry workshops, all industry stakeholders were given the opportunity of responding in advance to the proposed connection process.  To ensure the process operates efficiently and to keep the industry fully informed of developments, the CER has also established a Gate 3 liaison group involving EirGrid, ESB Networks and the renewable industry associations.  This is an important forum for information exchange, for the transparency of the Gate 3 process and to ensure delivery on time for all parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">There are undoubted challenges inherent in ensuring that connection offers under Gate 3 are matched by the timely building out of the distribution and transmission system.  I have made clear to EirGrid, ESB Networks, CER and the industry that addressing those challenges is a critical priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">On the Minister's reply, the term "on a first come, first served basis" is inappropriate at this particular time.  This is a wonderful area in which people are considering investing.  Many people are ready and willing to invest in this area.  Many of the projects in Gate 3 will probably never come to fruition.  I believe the Minister should be considering producing a strategic plan in regard to the locations where these investments should take place, taking account of wind speeds, proximity to the grid and affordability of the project.  In other words, projects must be ready to roll out.  It is in this respect we differ from the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">Is the Minister in control of policy or is CER dictating the trend in this regard?  We are not delivering to people who want to invest in this project.  If the Minister had money to invest at this particular time would he choose to invest in current wind energy projects, despite his having to wait seven years to get on a grid to obtain connection or would he consider buying out somebody currently on the waiting list, which is not satisfactory?  The Minister needs to take immediate action in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_218">We must constantly review procedures to ensure we are delivering on our target to provide more secure, cheap and clean energy supplies.  I take the point that we must constantly review the process.  We must also examine what has gone wrong in the past.  One of the reasons for our not developing as fast as we should was our stop-start policy.  The moratorium introduced in 2005-06 had a huge negative effect on the financing of some of these projects resulting in the delays that took place.  I am wary of adopting and then starting and stopping policy.  The approach we are taking is working.  I am told by EirGrid that an expected 500 MW of wind is due to connect this year.  This is what we need to do.  To my mind, we need to achieve 500 MWs year-in year-out for the next seven to eight years.  I would be reluctant to change policy on which there was consultation and in regard to which I spoke to the wind energy associations in terms of the advantages and disadvantages involved.  Like the Deputy, I, too, wonder if this "first come first served basis" is the right approach in terms of assessing which projects are in the Gate and which are not.  While the industry agrees there are difficulties with the approach it is by and large the best in terms of getting wind turbines or stations built.  There are real problems in getting Gate connections, planning permission and the financing required.  However, it is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Given the market is working and delivering at this time the 500 MW a year that we need and the Gate system allows us to at least plan the development of our grid, which is the crucial constraint, I ask that the Deputy support the current approach.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</from>
            <p eId="para_220">If policy is not working and is wrong then there is a need to change it.  Part of the Minister's argument in support of it working is that the industry is in the queue.  I inquired of EirGrid this morning the number of wind farm proposals for County Tipperary.  The response I got is interesting.  Of the 46 projects concerned, eight are already connected, 14 are in Gate 3 and 24 are in the queue.  I ask that the Minister investigate the 12 applications submitted with no project name included.  I am concerned that the Minister's policy may be leaving this open to speculation.  Is the regulator on top of his job?  We do not want happening here what happened in the financial industry.  The Minister is leaving this open to speculators, people who can apply and then sell on to others ready and willing to roll with a project but who would otherwise have to buy their place in Gate 3.  I ask that the Minister examine this element of speculation.</p>

I do not have any involvement with any one wind farm or developer.  It is best that this is approached on a scientific regulated basis, learning the lessons from some of the other industries.  We must ensure a proper regulated approach to this, which is what the CER is pursuing.

            <p eId="para_230">I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 63 and 75 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">The progressive introduction of electric vehicles into the road transport fleet is being promoted and supported in a number of ways in line with the Government target of 10% by 2020.  These include the agreement with Renault-Nissan together with anticipated further agreements with other car manufacturers, the roll-out of infrastructure by ESB networks and the VRT exemptions for electric vehicles together with the tax incentive for businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">The VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the VRT reliefs of up to €2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles, which were due to end in December 2010, have been extended for a further period of two years.  In addition, I recently announced the introduction of a grant scheme for up to 6,000 vehicles over a two year period commencing in January 2011.  Those purchasing a full battery electric vehicle will be grant aided by up to €5,000, depending on the price of the vehicle.  I also announced that grant aid of up to €2,500 is being provided for eligible plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">The electricity used in the on-street charging points comes from the grid and currently around 15% of this is produced from renewable energy.  The proportion of renewable electricity in the system and, by extension, being supplied to electric vehicles will increase year on year as progress is made towards the target of 40% for renewable energy in electricity by 2020.  The International Energy Agency recently forecast that approximately 30% of road transport vehicles will be electric by 2030.  Research, recently published in the Energy Policy Journal, has suggested that electric vehicles using electricity from the Irish grid would use 50% less energy per kilometre than fossil fuel powered vehicles and would result in similar CO<sub>2</sub> savings.  The research forecasts that savings of more than 70% greenhouse gas emissions per kilometre travelled will occur by 2020 as the level of renewables in the grid increases to meet the 40% target.</p>

            <p eId="para_234">We are back to electric transport again.  I refer to the Minister's target for 2020.  He plans to have approximately 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, some 10% of the car transport fleet.  Will the Minister outline to the House how he envisages the ramping up of the sales figures of electric vehicles between now and 2020?  The date is ten years away.  The Minister has already stated he plans to have between 3,000 and 5,000 electric vehicles on Irish roads by the end of 2012.  That leaves more than 190,000 vehicles remaining to be sold in eight years.  What is the plan or roadmap for the ramping up of sales of electric vehicles?  When do we begin to get into serious numbers, or is the Minister leaving that to the marketplace?</p>

            <p eId="para_239">Yes, but it is not providing a national network.  We must consider the proportion or the scale of the country.  I am satisfied that we will have approximately 2,000 vehicles next year.  At that stage, we will have the crucial test bed in place that will allow us to learn how it will work and how to make it work.  There are risks attached and there will be difficulties but by learning by doing, we will benefit from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_240">Some people asked how we can be certain that this technology will work rather than the range of other technological solutions.  One way is to look to every international car company.  They are now going electric.  The entire Japanese motor industry, most of the American motor industry and large chunks of the European motor industry maintain this is the way they see it going.  I do not believe it is such a great risk for a country such as Ireland, which has a very large renewable resource into which we can tap and which has a small scale and a smart grid system.  We have everything to gain.</p>

Generally speaking, we welcome the fact that there is now an incentive to buy an electric car and no one will take that away from the Minister.  However, as Deputy Coveney pointed out, there is still a mountain to climb in terms of meeting targets.  Will the Minister consider what has been described as a very attractive incentive, that is, to permit electric cars to travel in bus lanes?  This would create a tremendous stimulus for the acquisition of electric cars.</p>

The Minister should consider how we can use existing cars rather than building up a great stock of used cars that must be jettisoned to buy new electric cars.  I do not know how far this technology can go but I would be interested to hear the Minister's views in respect of the conversion of petrol-fuelled cars and whether possibilities exist in this regard.</p>

They will look no different except that they will not have an exhaust running out the back and they will be blessedly quiet.  If one sees a car whizzing up in a bus lane, one does not know whether it is electric.  We cannot allow them in bus lanes.  The bus lanes are working.  Let us extend the network, but they are for buses, taxis and emergency vehicles.</p>

His second business shared the storage space with the Dodge brothers who went on to form another car company.

Has he considered the fleets of cars that are available to State-owned companies?  The use of such cars would be an ambitious way of increasing the use of electric transport.  An Post's delivery systems are very predictable, particularly in urban areas.  Has the Minister spoken to representatives of An Post about the replacement of its fleet with electric cars, which could be charged at a central location?  I have spoken to An Post about this idea, which seems sensible to me.  In the case of Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus, what is being done to try to switch to carbon-neutral transport, for example using gas or electricity?  To what extent is the State showing leadership, with regard to the fleet it controls, to give the public confidence in electric transport?</p>

            <p eId="para_271">Yes it is, in a number of different ways.  Last year, we provided grants to a number of companies through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Celtic Linen in County Wexford, for example, was given a grant for a ten-tonne electric vehicle, to be used to transport linen.  We have working examples of how this system works — how charging happens, for example.  We are doing it and we are supporting it.  As I understand it, the ESB is seeking to purchase a fleet of vehicles for its own use to help it to learn by doing.  I will continue to recommend to An Post, Bord Gáis and a range of other companies that they should look at alternative transport solutions in their own fleets.  If we build a volume of vehicles to make it happen, we can test how it is happening and sell that expertise to the rest of the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">The late James Dillon, who led my party in a distinguished fashion for a number of years, used to say that politics is a vocation that draws people into stormy waters as well as calm.  This is true.  Everybody who serves in this House, for any party or none, understands that.  This profession has taken a beating on many fronts — some justified and some not.  I have never accepted that it is unconstitutional for the Government to legislate to put an end to the payment of ministerial pensions to people who continue to serve in the Oireachtas.  Prior to last year's budget, Fine Gael proposed as part of its pre-budget submission that legislation should be introduced to end the receipt of legitimate ministerial pensions by all serving Members of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance refused to divulge to me the legal advice that was given by the Attorney General in this regard.  I understand it relates to the principle of legitimate expectation.  In July of last year, the Government brought a Bill through the Oireachtas giving effect to a new law whereby from the first day of the next Dáil, no Member with ministerial experience who is entitled to a ministerial pension shall receive such a pension.  The Government followed that by reducing the scale of the pensions paid to people who formerly served as Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Today, the Fine Gael Party has published a Bill that would immediately terminate the payment of ministerial pensions to serving Members of the Oireachtas.  My challenge to the Taoiseach is to accept the Fine Gael Bill and thereby put an end to this practice for once and for all, in the interests of all concerned.  The relentless pursuit of individuals could then finally be dealt.  If this proposal is not accepted, I intend to place our Bill before the Dáil during next week's Private Members' business so that it can be voted on by Fianna Fáil and Green Party Deputies on the Government side.  I ask the Taoiseach to accept this Bill as a means of bringing an end to this practice.  I want him to understand that if the Government votes it down, all of those Fine Gael Members who are legally entitled to draw ministerial pensions will voluntarily give up such pensions, or give them to charity.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">As Deputy Kenny said, we legislated on this matter when it arose last year.  The issues that arose on that occasion related to an entitlement under existing law, regarding a pension being seen a property right.  We are advised that as property rights are protected under the Constitution, any reduction or removal of pensions by legislation has to be proportionate.  The reductions which have been imposed on other groups are of relevance in determining what is proportionate.  That is the advice we received from the Attorney General.  As the Deputy knows, it is the convention not to publish advice but that is the essence of it.  The pension entitlement for former Ministers who are serving Members of the Oireachtas will be abolished from the date of the next election.  That is the existing position.  We were advised that this position is consistent with the law and is what was possible.  Therefore, unlike the last election, persons who are deciding whether to contest the next election will not have a legitimate expectation that they will continue to receive a ministerial pension while in receipt of an Oireachtas salary.  A similar approach was taken in 1992 when changes to the receipt of ministerial pensions for Oireachtas Members did not take effect until after a general election had intervened.  One can presume the same legal issue arose then.  I have not seen or studied any proposal from Fine Gael on this matter.  I can have it examined but the position we have outlined is based on the advice of the Attorney General and, as the Deputy knows, the Government has to abide by that advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">This is not 1992; it cannot be and it is not business as usual.  I have received legal advice on the Bill published by Fine Gael today which states that it is constitutional to pass the Bill now and end this practice for everybody who is currently so entitled.  It can be done immediately.  The members of Fine Gael are willing to give up voluntarily those pensions if Fianna Fáil does not accept the Bill which I have put forward, which will also deal with members of Fianna Fáil.  There are some strong reports that the reason there is reluctance about this issue is that some members of Fianna Fáil who have considerable ministerial experience are in receipt of significant pensions.  In any event, this is a matter which is not of 1992.  This is 2010.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Yes.  The public at large is very angry about the mismanagement of the public finances.  This is an issue which has been around for some time.  It is unfair to have a situation where some do and some do not surrender their pensions.  My view and that of my party is that the Government can legislate for this in the same way as the Taoiseach said property rights were affected in 1992.  They will also be affected after the next election.  All the members of my party who are so affected are prepared to give up voluntarily ministerial pensions.  I understand the members of the Labour Party who are entitled to these legitimate pensions are voluntarily prepared to give them up.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to speak in the House, call in the members of his party and arrive at a similar position if he is still reluctant to introduce the legislation or prepared to vote it down next week?</p>

          <p eId="para_306">It is not a question of challenging it, but a question of having lawful legislation.  I am not saying the situation is the same as pertained in 1992 or any other time.  The same legal principles apply because a similar approach was taken then on the question of the abolition of pensions in respect of the legislation passed last year.  The Minister for Finance outlined that position in detail.  It is not a question of any party being reluctant to introduce legislation, but about having to address this matter in a legal and lawful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I have made, and continue to make, the point that one cannot abolish property rights.  One then has to have a proportionate reduction in payments, which we have done.  There has been a reduction of 25%, as people will know.  If people wish to gift or make a further contribution based on the current situation, that is a matter for each individual to consider and reflect upon, and they should be given that opportunity.  We have been very anxious to ensure that discretion is applied to every individual.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">I also want to raise a pension-related issue, namely, the plight of pensioners and low income households in this country who are facing a double whammy this weekend.  People will lose their fuel allowance as the winter scheme will come to an end at the end of April.  However, the cost of heating oil will increase as a result of the introduction of the carbon levy.  When the Minister for Finance announced the budget last year, he introduced a carbon levy which is coming into effect on Saturday, 1 May 2010 in respect of heating oil.  It will increase the price of heating oil by 8.7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">When the Minister introduced the budget, he promised that a vouched system of fuel allowances would be introduced for low income families who were affected by the introduction of the carbon levy.  My colleague, Deputy Shortall, has been pursuing the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and his predecessor about this issue for the past six months.  During that time the Government has not done anything to introduce the allowance.  There are 300,000 households in this country who will be affected by this next Saturday.  The increase of 8.7% in their heating oil bill, coming on top of the increase in the price of oil of 37% over the course of the past year, means that the total increase for low income households which are dependent on home heating oil will be 45%.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The levy is due to be introduced next Saturday.  Will the Taoiseach introduce the allowance, as was promised in the budget, or will he postpone the introduction of the carbon levy on heating oil until such time as the allowance is introduced to protect low income families from the effect of the carbon levy?</p>

          <p eId="para_312">The current allowance for free fuel and the various supplementary social welfare schemes in place to assist low income families will be available and cover the period from autumn to March, which is the period when people are most in need of heating requirements.  Therefore, the question of the provision of that scheme will be provided for in the normal way from then on.  In the meantime, if there are any hardship cases, the exceptional needs payments scheme continues to be available.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_314">That does not address the issue at all.  The winter fuel allowance which normally operates from October to April will expire; it is a standard fuel allowance which is available throughout the winter.  Many families and, in particular, elderly people, who are more prone to the cold than others, will know that the end of April is not the appropriate time to end the scheme.  If we have the kind of summer we had last year, many elderly people will have recourse to heating during the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The Minister for Finance promised an additional allowance specifically for low income families.  He said it would be a vouched allowance but never spelled out what kind of vouched allowance it would be.  There was to be a specific allowance to protect low income households from the impact of the carbon levy.  This levy will increase the price of heating oil by 8.7% which, as I pointed out, comes on top of increases in the price of oil over the past year.  It will present an additional hardship for people whose social welfare payments were cut by the Government in the budget and who had an additional cut in their payments as a result of the abolition of the Christmas bonus.  They are now facing additional fuel costs because of the introduction of the carbon levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach and is prompting his reply, promised Deputy Shortall last February that this scheme would be in place before the carbon levy was introduced.  It will come into effect on Saturday.  Will the allowance be in place by Saturday or will the Taoiseach postpone the introduction of the carbon levy until it is in place, in line with the commitment made by the Minster, Deputy Hanafin, when she held the social and family affairs portfolio?</p>

There are a number of elements to it including an apology and a full and fairly negotiated settlement but also legislation on the health needs of survivors of thalidomide.  As legislation is involved I thought you, a Cheann Comhairle, might allow me to ask the Taoiseach if the Cabinet has discussed the possibility of legislation.  A small number of people, 34 in all, had horrific problems imposed on them by the State many years ago through the use of the drug, thalidomide.  It is a group of people who deserve a properly negotiated compensation settlement as well as to have their health needs looked after and an apology.  Will the Taoiseach comment?</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I wish to ask about three items of legislation.  When will the nurses and midwives Bill on section A of the first list be taken?  The prescription charges Bill is the next one on the clár after that, at No. 9, yet the drugs reference pricing Bill is way back at No. 71.  When I last asked the Taoiseach about this, I said one Bill, which would inflict charges on those least able to pay, including the sick, the chronically ill and those on medical cards, and which might save €20 million plus had been considered very expeditiously.  However, the drugs reference pricing Bill, which would save hundreds of millions, is being put on the long finger.  The Taoiseach's response was to the effect that they were both on the same finger.  I hope that is not the middle finger he is giving to the public because No. 71 seems to relate to Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by Government, while the other Bill is to be published during this session.  Will the Taoiseach please enlighten the House on those three Bills?</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this legislation, which is one of the most important aspects of the financial resolution infrastructure to come before the House in recent months.  While we may say this about almost every item of legislation aimed at the resolution of the economic crisis, this Bill is particularly apposite since it deals, to a large extent, with regulation.  There is little doubt that regulation is at the heart of the problems we have experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Since summer 2008 there has scarcely been a day that Irish banks and the banking system have not made the front pages of the newspapers.  I heard one commentator remark in recent days that it has now been some time since the banks were relegated to the business pages, their natural home.  The banking system was for many years considered to be a subject that was rather dull and boring, and was discussed neither in the vernacular nor in general discourse.  We hanker back to those days and wish they would return soon.  However, I doubt they will, because of the damage that has been done by the failure of so many people to recognise the malpractice that was allowed to develop, which has caused a massive cancer in Irish society and, to a broader extent, in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">For many, the early morning announcement that an overnight Cabinet meeting had taken place was the first indication, back in September 2008, that a problem existed within the banking sector.  Since then it has been one bad-news story after another, day in day out.  The continual drip feed came in many cases from the Government and other parties to force the banking sector into an admission of its guilt and complicity in the malpractice that has had such a devastating impact on our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The arrogance of some of the players has been breathtaking.  Some have sought to deny from the very start that there was a problem and that they were involved in creating it through their failures and lack of respect for the trusted positions they held.  Many of these people pursued a greedy approach, enriching their own positions through the various schemes that were in place, and the focus for far too many in the banking sector switched to feathering their own nests.  They spent time managing their own pension funds and investments rather than accepting their responsibility to protect other people's investments.  That is the most shocking revelation of all — the prevalence of the quick buck, or the capacity for people to earn large bonuses based on short-term benchmarks or the assumption that they had in some way developed their investments to the point at which they were making a return.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The implications of rolling up interest should have been fundamentally obvious to everyone.  Yet such deals were taken to indicate, somehow, that the bank had received a return, and people received bonuses on the basis that investments had come good.  However, in many cases the investment had not taken off at all, although the money had been spent.  There is little doubt that these continued investment practices created the building boom and the lack of prudence in lending fed into a property sector that was already doing quite well.  The endless supply of funds made it possible for small players within the sector to believe they were large players.  This had a devastating impact on the economy because it further fuelled the boom.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The problem was not restricted to loans for the building sector.  We have seen in the analysis of NAMA the amount of money expended — which was funded through crazy lending practices — on the purchase of agricultural land in small villages with little or no infrastructure because of a belief that rezoning had taken or would take place.  There was a belief that the zoning of land for residential purposes somehow conferred an expectation that there would be 300 or 500 houses, even in villages that had never had a population of more than 75 or 80 people.  That the banks did not have even the basic cop-on to investigate this with due diligence is breathtaking.  That is proof, if proof were needed, that there was a complete disconnect between the lending of the money and the expected return.  Any half-wit that set about considering the future potential of the bank's investment would conclude that there was little or no chance of a return on the loan.  It seems that bankers were more concerned about short-term gain by virtue of a bonus based on money having been lent rather than having been earned by the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Some have sought to distance themselves or say they were involved in driving on the economy; I do not buy it, and nor do many others.  Some were professionals who had risen through the ranks and developed the culture.  That the so-called economists who worked for the financial institutions continued to give projections for property growth that were unconnected to the growth in population or the expected population dispersal is breathtaking.  They continued to contribute to the hype and to give positive appraisals without ever rooting them in the fundamentals.  That is a clear indication that an entire culture that was quite a distance from reality had developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Some of these bankers sought to blame others.  One person, after the crisis erupted, seemed to indicate that the problem in our economy was the minimum wage.  This was a person with a massive salary, bonus and pension entitlement; yet the cleaner earning €8.65 an hour was the problem.  It just sums it up.  Another person seemed to suggest that the banking problem, from his point of view, would not be resolved through the investment of cash by the State, indicating on one occasion that the only way one particular institution would require funding from the State was over his dead body.  This is an example of the arrogance of some in suggesting that they were invincible.  As we have seen, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">We saw the tip of the iceberg of a culture of delusion and deception that existed within our banking system.  There is little doubt that the regulator was asleep at best, and at worst somehow colluded in the ongoing deception.  I do not say that lightly, but there can be no other excuse.  If professional people who are well paid and well qualified and have all the information available to them continue to propagate a lie, as they did before various committees of this House and in various reports, we must question their motives.  As I said, either they were asleep or they were in collusion in some way, which is disturbing.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Given that every aspect of Irish society has been affected by what has happened, most people recognise the necessity for a strong and effective suite of measures to deal with the problem.  For this reason, the legislation under discussion, which seeks to bring together the best aspects of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator under one board, where a much more co-ordinated approach can be taken to the overall management of the banking system, while retaining the capacity within the same framework to manage the prudential requirement of each institution, is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Whatever architecture or regulatory framework we put in place, unless there are people who are prepared to do their jobs in line with the legislation and with what is expected of them by society and by those who make the laws, we are going nowhere.  It would be wrong to suggest that the framework that existed in the past was overly deficient, because it was not.  There were issues with it, which this Bill seeks to resolve.  However, it comes down to people having the wherewithal to stand up and say "Stop".  We have all learned a difficult lesson in recent weeks as the Financial Regulator has done exactly this with regard to Quinn Insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">We all recognise what a wonderful company Quinn was and what fantastic work Seán Quinn and his family, who were motivated in such a selfless way, have done.  However, when insurance policies and the financial system are placed in jeopardy because of risky decisions and mistakes, someone has to shout "Stop".  Mr. Elderfield has done the State an exceptional service.  Along with Professor Honohan in the Central Bank and Mr. McDonagh in NAMA, he has given confidence to the international markets and helped to restore Ireland's battered image.  Over the past several weeks, these three individuals have done a good job in getting us back on the long and difficult path to recovery.  In ensuring the mistakes of the past never happen again, the Bill before us will restore further our credibility.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_532">It is a pleasure to speak on the Central Bank Reform Bill 2009 and I support its proposal to establish a commission to replace the existing hybrid structure of IFSRA and the Central Bank.  When IFSRA was first established, I questioned the need for such a body given that under the existing system the Central Bank was responsible for financial regulation alongside the Stock Exchange and other bodies.  It appeared a strange decision to make at a time when the Central Bank was losing powers because of the introduction of the euro.  It is right, therefore, that the bodies are being merged once again.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I have concerns about the transfer of consumer functions to the National Consumer Agency, which has a good staff and CEO but has not produced many benefits for consumers thus far.  Given that it is the Government's policy as stated in the emergency budget of April 2009 and ours as stated in our streamlining Government document to abolish the National Consumer Agency and replace it with a new body incorporating the functions of it and the Competition Authority, it is strange that the Bill provides for the transfer of these functions.  Does it remain Government policy to abolish the agency and, if so, why is legislative provision not being made for the transfer of functions?</p>
          <p eId="para_534">My main problem with the Bill is not so much its proposals for reform as what these do not include.  Reforming the architecture of financial regulation in this State is not enough on its own and we need the right people for a start.  If people such as Mr. Elderfield or Professor Honohan were appointed to their current positions five years ago, different decisions would have been made even under the existing legislation and principle-based rules.  Over the past seven years, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator were the dogs that barked but did not bite.  The Central Bank's Quarterly Bulletin and the regulator's reports repeatedly warned the public, media and political class that the economy was overheating and excessive property lending was creating huge risks but these organisations did not go public or take similar actions to those pursued by Mr. Elderfield in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Irrespective of the architecture developed, it is important that we have the right people.  As a State, we rely on having a wise Minister for Finance who makes the right appointments.  The current Minister has made the right appointments to these positions but his predecessors, the Taoiseach and Charlie McCreevy, made the wrong ones.  I do not have confidence that future Ministers will make the right appointments and this is why we need some form of public or parliamentary scrutiny of people before they are appointed Financial Regulator or Governor of the Central Bank.  We cannot rely on the Minister of the day to make the correct decisions and I fear that a future Minister for Finance will be somebody like the Taoiseach.  The Bill before us does not address that danger.  Parliamentary scrutiny would allow us to test people before they are appointed to these important positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I understand from the Minister's statement that further legislation is planned but I wonder why we are still waiting for it two years after the banking crisis erupted.  We are still waiting for updated rules on the conditions and securities which should accompany mortgages and loans.  It is shocking that the Government's banking policy lacks a proper resolution regime.  The United Kingdom Act, which could almost be copied and pasted here, provides that insolvent banks can be taken into administration.  It is unforgivable that two years after the bank guarantee and the insolvency of our banking system we have not yet introduced such legislation.  I will not go into the rights and wrongs of the decision taken on Quinn Insurance but it is clear that the Financial Regulator acted under existing legislation which allows him to intervene where an insurance company is in danger of insolvency.  Similar legislation which would allow him to take an insolvent bank into administration does not exist.  The time that the bank guarantee bought us has been squandered by the Minister and his Government colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">In researching for this debate, I studied the speeches on the bank guarantee scheme, which was held on 29 and 30 September 2008, because Deputies on all sides of this House have been rewriting history since then, particularly in regard to why they supported or opposed the guarantee.  I am afraid to say that the quality of the debate was very poor, although we have learned a lot about banking since then.  There was hardly any mention of bondholders, subordinated debt or whether it was appropriate that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide were included in the guarantee.  While the latter issue was discussed on subsequent days, it was not addressed in the period immediately after the announcement of the guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">On 30 September 2008, the morning after the guarantee of the night before, the Taoiseach stated in response to Deputy Kenny:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_539">The banking system in Ireland has assets which exceed its liabilities.  The assets of the Irish banking system amount to approximately €500 billion and the guarantee liabilities are approximately €400 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">We now know that was absolutely untrue.  The assets which the Taoiseach told the Dáil were worth €500 billion were actually worth two thirds of that figure if we are lucky.  It is clear, therefore, that either he was wrong or he misled the House.  He went on to state that the Government:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_541">. . . has provided a State guarantee to deal with liquidity which was critical to the continuation and health of the financial system.  By doing so, we are not exposing taxpayers' money to the provision of that equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Again, that statement was untrue because the decision taken by the Government completely exposed taxpayers' money to the provision of equity.  Indeed, we have taken equity stakes since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">In response to Deputy Gilmore, the Taoiseach stated: "The issue here is that solvent banks, which have assets in excess of their liabilities, are faced with an unprecedented situation whereby there is a credit crunch..."  That was untrue.  The banks were not solvent.  Two of them were insolvent and it is likely another two were as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, speaking on the guarantee Bill stated: "There is understandable concern that the Exchequer is potentially significantly exposed by this measure."  He want on to state that the "exposure from this decision is significantly mitigated by a very substantial buffer made up of the equity and other risk capital in the relevant institutions".  That also was not the case.  We found out subsequently that the banks were considerably under capitalised. On that occasion the Minister was so unable to manage the facts or manage his brief that he either did not understand the facts or he misled the Dáil.  He went on to state: "It is estimated that the total assets of the six financial institutions concerned exceed their guaranteed liabilities by approximately €80 billion."  That also was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in the same debate, spoke of what he described as a bold move the Government had taken and stated: "I am very proud of the role the Green Party was able to play in providing this innovative solution."  This is something he will live to regret.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Even though I do not like to say it, one of the more astute contributions made during that debate was one that I made.  At the time, I stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_547">I do not agree that the main problem with the banking sector is liquidity.  I think there is a capital problem as well.  The banks have squandered their capital on mistaken loans to the property sector and I really wonder whether, in all cases, their assets exceed their liabilities.  I will be interested to see how the Minister has been assured of that and how he has come to the conclusion that their assets ... [exceed their liabilities by] €80 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_549">I am disappointed that there are no consequences or punishment for some of the people who are, in part, responsible for this situation — bankers who made inappropriate loans, the Central Bank to a certain extent, and also Ministers who had the opportunity to act to rein in the financial sector, but did not do so for various reasons...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_550">We have a national crisis and on this side of the House we are doing our best to offer responsible and patriotic opposition.  As a result, and because this Bill changes other pieces of legislation, we are by and large supporting this Bill on trust.  The Government has asked for bipartisanship and a Tallaght strategy, and they will get it on this one Bill.  However, the responsibility for this lies on the heads of Government Ministers and woe betide [any of] them if any banks fall or if taxpayers are left with significant liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">It is nice to be right about issues but, at least on this occasion, I wish I was not.  What shocks me is that I made that speech 18 months ago on the night of the bank guarantee when I could see what was happening and what the true situation was, and the Government, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach either could not see the wood from the trees because they were so incompetent at doing their job or, alternatively, deliberately misled the Dáil on those occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">What needs to be done now seems clear to me.  There is a bank guarantee.  It was probably still the correct decision to take, although perhaps it would have been wiser to guarantee the liabilities and not the assets.  At the very least, it was two years in which we could buy time and in which to repair the financial system but those two years have not been used wisely.  Essentially, there have already been five bailouts — the guarantee, the first recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland before Christmas of 2008, the second recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, NAMA, and the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland and AIB now planned.  They have not worked and what we need now is a very different approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">We need to clear out the banks of their top brass.  Second, we need to set salary caps across the banks, not only for the positions of chief executive.  It is absurd that there are bank chief executives whose salaries are capped at €500,000, and yet there are people under them who are allowed to earn €600,000 and €700,000.  For so long as there is a Government shareholding in those banks, the salaries of senior bankers should be capped at public service levels, perhaps linked to Civil Service salaries as ours are, and they should only be allowed to set their salary limits again or to break those caps when they have repaid in full, and bought back from the Government, all the shares that the State has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Third, we need to wind down Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I am encouraged by the large number of independent commentators who did not agree with my party's position on this eight months ago and who now are very much coming around to that view, be it Mr. Willie Slattery of Citibank, Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev, David McWilliams, Moore McDowell and Morgan Kelly.  Increasing numbers of people are coming to the view that we can save up to €15 billion with our banking policy by winding down Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  That does not mean letting them collapse or  allowing them to call on the guarantee.  It means essentially a debt for equity swap, saying to the bondholders that they will not get all their money back and they will have to share in the pain by only getting the market value for their bonds, perhaps 30 cent or 40 cent in the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">We also need to put in place a bank levy for future bailouts because if one looks back over history, asset bubbles come and go while banking systems do collapse.  This has happened on several occasions throughout history.  Even with the right architecture, the best people and the best regulatory structures in place there are likely to be future banking crises similar to the one we have now.  They may not be as great, or they may be similar in scale to what happened in the 1980s.  A permanent banking levy needs to be put in place to build up a fund of money that can be used should a similar situation arise in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">We also need a new bank, a national recovery bank, as advocated by my party and now supported by the Labour Party.  We need to introduce a banking resolution law to give the Financial Regulator the power to take over insolvent banks and bring them into administration.  We also need a decision by the Government as soon as possible on the guarantee and on what it intends to do with it.  I accept it cannot be ended overnight but a plan is needed to see how it can be unwound over time, especially as it has acted as a constraint on all banking policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Some 18 months after the introduction of the guarantee and five bailouts later, with the best part of €25 billion to €30 billion added to our national debt, we have the Bill before us.  It does not address the issues in our banking crisis that need to be addressed.  That is why we need a new approach to banking.  The sooner we have a new Government to do this the better.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_396">
          <from>Deputy Noel Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_558">I listened to the contributions by some earlier speakers in this debate some of which were thoughtful and interesting.  Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte in particular made thoughtful, wise and reflective contributions looking back over their time in Dáil Éireann.  I will exclude from that the contribution by the Labour Party spokesperson on finance because she engaged in approximately 20 minutes of finger-pointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Over the years a trend has emerged where an architectural framework is constructed and then dismantled because it is considered not to have done what was intended.  We now appear to be repeating this exercise with this Bill.  The 2003 Act established the Financial Regulator as an independent regulator within the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland, reporting both to the board of the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance.  At that stage the regulator was to be responsible for the regulation of most of the financial service providers in Ireland, including the credit unions.  I received a detailed letter from the credit union movement, the content of which can be addressed on Committee Stage.  The credit unions see this as an opportunity to make their input.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Prior to the establishment of the current regulatory system, responsibility for regulation was spread over a number of different bodies and codes.  This Bill is part of a three stage legislative process to create a new, fully integrated regulatory structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The previous speaker stated that this is the first of three Bills and that these measures should have been introduced six or 12 months ago.  However, some of his colleagues said the very opposite last week.  They questioned the reason for this new and completely integrated structure when the banking inquiry has not been held.  They argued for the introduction of the broad architecture but stated that we should not go too far at this stage.  Many people know what went wrong but we should wait for the report of the banking inquiry to pinpoint the weaknesses so that this three-point legislation will take them on board.  The Minister has announced two further pieces of legislation to make up the complete framework.  I am sure by the time they are progressed through the House that the banking inquiry will have done its work and its recommendations will be considered in that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The issue of regulation has developed over time.  Now everybody is calling for more and stronger regulation both in banking and business, whereas a few years ago the trend was to have less regulation in farming, business, cottage industries and many other areas.  Speakers both inside and outside the House questioned the involvement of the State and argued for less State interference.  They questioned why the State was depressing initiative, flair and innovation.  The Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats would have been big into the mantra of there being too much regulation across society.  We may have agreed with this view at different stages until the banking crisis blew up in our faces.  If some of those speeches were read again, many of us might be embarrassed at the statements we made from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Speaking from the Government side of the House, it is easy for the Opposition in many respects.  It is changing tack now and blaming the Government for not sorting out the statutory officers, the regulator and the Central Bank and for failing to prevent the banking crisis.  All of a sudden, the regulator is God.  I note the suggestions made a few weeks ago that if any Minister telephoned the regulator or mentioned anything to him, this might be deemed to be a form of pressure.  Suddenly, it is inappropriate to curtail the regulator in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">It is very fashionable to bash the old regime and the former regulator.  There is no doubt that things went horribly and drastically wrong on his watch.  I never met the man but at times I was a little concerned about him.  The architecture of the system — a phrase everyone uses — was set up after much discussion and departmental and political disagreement about what should be set up.  He was told to do his job but he was asked to bear in mind that the Central Bank was not to be upset.  It was a case of walking on eggs in his case.  It was not desirable to have inter-agency or inter-statutory officer rows and it was a case of doing the job without getting in one another's hair and attempting to co-operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The current attitude is that the regulator is supreme and one cannot say boo to him, so to speak.  We always seem to go from one extreme to another.  I refer to comments about extra resources being required by the regulator.  I ask the Minister to clarify the staffing levels in the regulator's office.  Some people think the regulator consists of one individual.  I have heard figures of 600 and 1,100 staff in his office.  Before the Government approves another couple of hundred staff, I suggest it examines the structure of the sections in the office.  For example, a few years' ago, a business in my constituency complained to me that it was being put out of business, more or less, by the former regulator because there seemed to be a lot of bureaucratic nit-picking.  If the section controlling the banking sector is short-staffed, I suggest staff could be moved from other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Members will have received many e-mails from employees of the Quinn Group.  Suddenly it is all to do with proper and strong regulation.  Ministers make announcements about new multinational companies setting up in Ireland or the expansion of existing companies and there is often much hullabaloo about 50 or 100 jobs being created.  We are very pleased to see new jobs being created, yet we might be about to lose several hundred jobs in the Quinn Group.  There is almost a delight in certain quarters that we are correcting bad practices but I wish we moved more slowly.  I acknowledge more regulation is necessary and that the system failed but I would hate to think that because the mantra or the mood changed, we put hundreds of people out of work when a slightly more joined-up Government approach would save those jobs.  I agree we had to stamp out weak practices and weak regulation but I wish these things could be done gradually.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Many people are of the view that the former regulatory system was meant to work.  I compare it to the talk about the volcanic ash last week in which case there was supposed to be a system and a plan in place to deal with all types of events and along comes an unprecedented event and nobody knows what to do.  Situations are not always as easy to handle as was expected. When I was a Minister of State, I observed a few cases where it was difficult to get the political system, the statutory officers, the Department of Finance, the regulators or the Central Bank to recognise that a problem was brewing.  I recall doing my best to discourage 100% mortgages and their ridiculous marketing whereby people walking down Grafton Street at lunchtime were encouraged to take out 100% mortgages on what was almost an impulse buy.  Some of the statutory officers at the time noted my views but suggested I should revert to them when I had verifiable data to prove my point.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">It would be a bit like me taking out a grenade, pulling the pin and throwing it down into the well of the Chamber.  Obviously, only one thing will happen — it will blow up.  In such a scenario, statutory officers, however, would be inclined to say "Yes, yes, yes, let me know when it does blow and tell me what the damage is" while everyone else would say, "Jesus, that thing down there is going to blow".  Likewise, statutory officers would claim the concerns about lending were only a hunch and that we cannot base major policy decisions on a hunch.  They would ask one to come back with evidence-based research data, compiled by an accounting consultant, which would take a year anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Some Members referred to Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS.  Last week, Deputy Gilmore asked the Taoiseach if he ever heard any rumours or whispers about the building society when the Building Societies (Amendment) Act 2006, which would allow building societies, including INBS, to demutalise, was introduced.  I was involved with the legislation as a Minister of State and at the time there was a complaint from the Ombudsman concerning overcharging.  Apart from that, there were no other issues of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Deputy Gilmore, however, was egging on the Taoiseach about the chit-chat around the Houses and elsewhere at the time.  As we all know Michael Fingleton ran INBS like a personal fiefdom.  We never heard mention of any other senior officers or a board of directors there.  Michael Fingleton was very much into self-promotion and, therefore, promoting his building society.  I have often heard from colleagues about the widely held view around these corridors that for a journalist or a politician looking for a loan or mortgage for himself or anyone else, the friendliest and most accessible person in financial institutions was Michael Fingleton.  The bigger the fish one was in the media or political pond, the more personal the attention one received.  If one were a really big fish like a Minister or a correspondent, one might have even got a personal telephone call from Michael Fingleton informing one of a loan approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">There is no doubt Michael Fingleton had many media friends who he worked well over many years for his own publicity.  I often heard it joked that most members of the Press Gallery, not necessarily those in the class of 2010, got their mortgages from Irish Nationwide.  I have no self-interest since my mortgage was with the EBS.  However, Michael Fingleton, as everyone knows, was approachable and did many favours for many people in here and up there in the Press Gallery, as well as in other places.  There is no doubt as he moved on from mortgages to property, land and development that he totally lost the run of himself, ending up in disaster for the taxpayer and, indeed, for many of his clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I recall before we passed the Building Societies (Amendment) Act 2006, Members were popping up every morning on the Order of Business asking when the legislation would be introduced because their constituents were on to them about when they would get their free shares from demutualisation and make their fortunes.  Unfortunately, the money many of these constituents were going to get, as well as much more, has gone up in smoke.  No one can condone the absolute mess made by some of the banks and building societies in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Some Members referred to whether Anglo Irish Bank should have been sold last year or kept going forever.  This is a non-argument.  We could not have announced we were going to close it in September 2008 because there would have been a run on the bank which we would not have been able to handle.  Equally, I do not believe the bank will be there in its totality in 15 or 20 years time.  I am sure we will either sell it, reduce its size or put up a new sign over its door calling it "The Happy Bank".  It is a bit of a non-event.  With a bank like Anglo Irish, one has to keep it going, control it, examine its strengths and weaknesses.  I am sure the Government and its board of directors will decide what to do with it.  Most of it is a disaster case but there may be segments that could be developed, expanded or sold off.  It is a bit of a non-argument wondering what to do in the long term.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I hope the Bill is right.  While the legislation deals with the architecture of financial regulation, it depends on those who operate it.  There is no doubt we will be paying the price for this mess for some time.  It will be up to the banking inquiry as to who made the boo boo of it all.  No one realised things could have gotten so bad.  We were at a certain stage of our own ten-year growth pattern and then along came certain world problems that put us into a spin.  The system between the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance has already been in place.  Hopefully, this legislation will get a better structure in place.  However, this and the other two Bills will have to be influenced by the banking inquiry that will be held over the next 12 months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_578">Tá áthas orm an deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille tábachtach seo — cé nach dtéann sé fada go leor — An Bille um Athchóiriú an Bhanc Ceannais, ina bhfuil muid ag iarraidh a dhéanamh cinnte nach dtarlóidh a leithéid agus a tharla go dtí seo arís amach anseo.  Táimid ag foghlaim ó bhotúin na ndaoine úd a bhí i gceannas go dtí seo agus, is trua an rud é, ó dhaoine atá fós i gceannas.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The last contribution reminded me of school religion classes on Pontius Pilate washing his hands of the crucifixion.  The Government has no conscience when it comes to its deeds which led to the current banking scandal.  That is the most galling part of the debate and the Government's actions to date.  It feels it has absolutely no responsibility for the situation in which the State finds itself, for the many thousands of people who face unemployment and repossession orders or for the many thousands of young people contemplating emigrating from these shores.  It is not good enough for a Government Member to stand up in here to waffle for 20 minutes and to wash his hands of the consequences of his Government's actions which have led to a banking scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">This State is being run by a cosy cartel of right-wing politicians.  Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have been bailing out the banks with more and more taxpayers' money in the past two years.  What has that achieved?  What lessons have been learned by those who have caused the financial crisis?  If one were to go by the previous contribution in particular, nothing has been learned.  It seems to be a case of business as usual and would it not be great if we returned to the era of bonuses and pay rises?  We seem to have already returned to that era if we examine recent announcements on various banks which are effectively under receivership.  I refer to Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland in particular but also to Allied Irish Banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The bottom line is that the banks took risks because they knew that if they failed they would be bailed out, and they are being bailed out by a bottomless recapitalisation offered by the Government.  They know with even greater certainty that they will continue to get away with their selfish, reckless practices which have brought this country to the brink of ruin.  This Government has rewarded bad behaviour when instead it should have sent the financialshysters to sit on the naughty step.  In fact, they should be in jail.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">This week, Goldman Sachs is being investigated in the United States for fraud.  It has been credibly alleged that, as the banking crisis and recession took hold, Goldman Sachs exploited that as an opportunity to make further profit for itself at the expense of others.  Reports suggest that while the economy was turning belly up, Goldman Sachs developed and sold risky mortgage packages and then bet against them.  That was a win-win position for the Wall Street giant.  A series of damning internal Goldman Sachs e-mails has been published by the United States authorities, one of which reports the good news that the wipe-out of one security and the imminent collapse of another meant that Goldman Sachs would make $5 billion from a bet against the instruments it had set up and sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Even after the US authorities moved to charge Goldman Sachs with fraud against its investors to the tune of $1 billion, and the German and British authorities in turn commenced investigations, what was its response?  Goldman Sachs, one of the top companies, could not care less about the investigation.  It awarded itself a new round of bonuses for its staff amounting to $3.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">One might ask what all of that has got to do with us.  As the Government consistently reminds us, in a futile effort to evade taking responsibility for the nation's current troubles, we live in a global economy.  Our banks are tied up with the international financial markets.  Our banks eventually follow where their international role models lead, and Goldman Sachs analysts issue assessments of Irish banks which have consequences for their ability to raise capital.  The per-share profit estimates issued by Goldman analysts have consequences for Irish stocks.  IfGoldman Sachs is found to be involved in the fraud alleged, that has consequences in terms of all the advice the Government listened to from that quarter in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">What has the Government done in response to the growing evidence of fraud by this financial ogre?  I would like to know if it has blacklisted Goldman Sachs from future contracts and consultancies.  Has it sought to minimise the consequences for Ireland of the activities of this organisation?  It has not done so to date.  In fact, the Fianna Fáil-led Government sought an endorsement of the NAMA plans from Goldman Sachs and it has been happy to rely on that ever since.  Is that a flawed endorsement?  Is it to benefit Goldman Sachs?  Is Goldman Sachs betting against us?  Is it betting on its failure?  Is that what is behind its endorsement?</p>
          <p eId="para_586">We should not be under any illusion.  Fine Gael would not do any better.  The slimey Fine Gael hack, Peter Sutherland, who is pumped up on his own arrogance and self-importance, would close half of the Irish universities if he got his way.  He is a chairman of Goldman Sachs International.  I note also that one of the Senators in the other House is a director of Goldman Sachs Ireland.  That world of cosy, crony capitalism which both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael inhabit is a source of our country's woes and almost our financial ruin.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">It is not just the political masters who are responsible, but also the financial masters.  Bank of Ireland announced today its intention to impose another round of interest rate hikes on mortgage customers.  That follows the 50% increase on home insurance premiums it commenced recently.  The Government is a 36% shareholder in Bank of Ireland, yet Bank of Ireland continues to enjoy the guarantee from the Government.  That is not acceptable because Bank of Ireland is penalising its customers for its mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The Government, using its shareholding, must intervene because Bank of Ireland is screwing the taxpayer who is bailing it out.  It is further screwing the taxpayers who have mortgages with it through its interest rate rises.  Is that to pay for its bonuses or for its failed gambling and to ensure it can continue to make profits on the back of the Irish people?  It appears it is in a win-win position because it does not suffer the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">One of the roles of the Central Bank is to curb those excesses and ensure that those who gamble, and it is a major gamble because the stock market is playing monopoly with people's lives and we have seen the consequences of that recently, are not allowed to pass on the consequences of their gambling to the taxpayer.  That is what has been happening in the banking sector in recent months and in the past two years in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">A property lending binge was embarked upon by the Irish banks for almost a decade, and possibly longer.  The Government facilitated that and was very much pro-real estate policy.  For almost 15 years, the growth in bank credit outstripped the nominal growth in GNP by a factor of 2% to 3%.  Poor lending standards, unregulated products and bonus bonanzas brought the financial sector to its knees.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The Central Bank's role should have been to show caution but it did not do that.  It ensured that credit was readily available and, as a result, a range of financial liberalisation measures including relaxation and abolition of exchange controls, interest only mortgages, 100% mortgages, equity withdrawal, re-mortgaging and mortgaging with longer terms occurred under the watch of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  All of them occurred under the governance of the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Who suffered from the miserable excuse for regulation that was prevalent in this State?  It was not any member of the current Cabinet or of a Cabinet that governed during that period.  None of the consecutive Taoisigh or Ministers for Finance who presided over that regime has been held to account to date.  It is hoped the electorate will hold them to account in due course.  It was not any of the bank directors who abused the system for their own gain, and we have seen by way of a drip-drip measure the way they abuse their position, and nor has it been the auditors or the accountants who were blind to or hid the abnormalities across these financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The people who have suffered are the ordinary people who are being crippled by the failure to regulate properly.  I refer to the people who got 90% to 100% mortgages and those who are now facing mortgage interest hikes while simultaneously losing their jobs and having social welfare cuts imposed on them because their taxes are being used to bail out banks and property speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The economic crisis would have been less severe had legislation or regulations to restrict predatory lending been adopted.  Some argued at the time that loose lending standards would enable more individuals to become homeowners, but it should have been made clear that giving a loan to somebody which was beyond their capacity to pay is not doing them or society a favour; the opposite is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The main beneficiaries were those giving the loans.  People are now burdened with unsustainable mortgage debt and the prospect of repossession.  This is the direct effect of Fianna Fáil dismantling of regulation and its failure to heed warnings from economists and members of the Opposition.  We heard on television and radio advertisements for financial services products at the end of which was included the familiar by-line "regulated by the Financial Regulator".  Looking back, what good did this do ordinary people?  From what we can see, financial regulation during the most controversial period in our economic history was redundant.  In fact, it gave licence to the risky and speculative financial practices that have thrown Ireland into the economic mess it is now in.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">We want all those who participated in and encouraged the practices that brought about the current crisis held to account and criminal convictions pursued.  There were early warnings of what the banks were engaging in.  There was little doubt what caused this and little was done to improve regulation in the banking sector.  The OECD criticised Irish financial regulation and supervision, in particular in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, saying that the threat of enforcement was too weak and that the regulator should have been better informed and more intrusive in dealing with that institution.  The signs were ignored by the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Government.  Had any of them paid attention to the balance sheet growth of Anglo Irish Bank, actions could have been taken to curb the crisis that was developing in that institution.  Usually, a 20% growth in any financial institution would be a catalyst for action by the Central Bank or Financial Regulator.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank the average annual growth was 36%.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">While it was uncovered in 1997 that directors of National Irish Bank were acting <i>ultra vires</i>, it took 11 years before they were brought to court and struck off.  There should be no delays or backlogs in dealing with wrongdoing in the financial sector.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda Síochána have to date failed to secure the prosecution of bankers despite 18 months of investigations.  Are we to wait a further ten years before one or two bankers are prosecuted?  I hope not.  The white collar crime and corruption that has engulfed the Irish banking sector needs to be treated as seriously as any other form of crime and needs to be prosecuted quickly and effectively.  The failure to date of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government to prosecute the bankers is undermining the financial well-being of this State.  What they did is the equivalent of economic sabotage.  Other people have referred to this as “treason”.  They have through their actions put not alone the banking sector but the entire country in crisis.  Regulatory sanctions should in the future be sufficient to ensure compliance and to penalise proportionately in respect of proven breaches.  We need to ensure this happens.  In the United States, Bernie Madoff was imprisoned on 12 March 2009, some 91 days following the investigation by authorities there.  The failure of the Irish Government to conduct a thorough investigation and to bring prosecutions against bankers and financial miscreants can be attributed to a lack of political will and a fear of what will be uncovered, namely, that these malpractices were allowed to happen because of the Government-created culture and the exposure of political favouritism.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I heard the previous speaker refer to Mr. Michael Fingleton and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  He stated that Mr. Fingleton ran that institution like a personal fiefdom.  There are many within and outside this House who are beholden to Mr. Fingleton.  These people need to be exposed so that the full extent of that corruption is known.  This is the case not alone in terms of Irish Nationwide Building Society but also in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland in respect of favours given and by which all of the regulations and rules in regard to mortgages were breached time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">In terms of Anglo Irish Bank, the skulduggery and manoeuvrings of that bank will possibly result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in the Quinn Group.  A case can be made, given the nature and importance of these jobs in the Border region and in parts of Dublin, for nationalisation of the Quinn Group until such time as it can be sold.  It should be nationalised to secure those jobs and existing business.  It can then be sold off in the future if the State so wishes, as it did with the PMPA.  The case can also be made that we already own these companies because of the Government bailout of Anglo Irish Bank and the fact that we have underwritten it.  Somebody needs to speak up to protect those jobs.  Perhaps that company could be nationalised to protect the interests of the State and the 6,000 jobs involved.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">A financial regulator needs to show that it has the resolve to monitor and enforce.  There needs to be a strong appetite and a political support for strong enforcement action.  If the regulator lacks the political support needed to impose sanctions, enforcement may be severely compromised.  This was the problem with principles-based regulation and cannot be allowed to continue.  I believe much more needs to be done to protect ordinary people who deal with banks on an ongoing basis.  An alternative is needed to the business practices of the big banks who ignored the small creditor and deposit holder.  I believe we need a State bank which looks after these interests and has local branches.  Many of the big companies who have caused the mess we are in are those who not so long ago closed small branch networks around the country.  It is a pity some of these banks did not concentrate more on small lenders and businesses.  Perhaps then we would not be in the crisis we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">It is time this Government stood back and allowed somebody else to take over.  I welcome the Bill.  However, I do not believe it has political backing because the people behind it and those on whom they are depending for advice are the same people responsible for the predicament we are in.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">On the face of it, the Central Bank Reform Bill 2009 appears to be reasonable legislation.  I compliment those in the Department of Finance who worked on it.  Having spent time as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I am aware of the expertise there, which it is evident has been brought to bear on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Having said that, a question arises, not in regard to the work of the officials on the Bill, but in regard to its failure to address a particular issue, namely, we still do not know why the previous regulatory system failed so spectacularly.  That system was put in place approximately ten years ago, which is relatively recent.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">This followed a report by a Oireachtas joint committee in 1998.  That 2003 Bill was the basis on which a system was put in place which was supposed to be the answer to all our problems but it did not work.  Now, we have a new reform Bill, the mechanics of which appear to be fine.  However, I believe there is a fundamental flaw on the part of the Government in bringing the Bill to the House at this time.  When introducing the legislation, the Minister stated the causes of the financial crisis should be and would be investigated and that we would have a report in due course.  In the meantime, we have scoping exercises.  They will be followed by a commission of inquiry which will report only God knows when, but hopefully before the reports of the tribunals sitting in Dublin Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">If we are to have any confidence in a new system, surely we should know now the causes and the reasons the outgoing system failed so spectacularly.  If we do not know the flaws of the outgoing system, how can we cure them?  This is a problem and, to a large degree, we are flying blind.  It is not the fault of the officials who put together the mechanics of the Bill; they stand up.  However, because we do not know what caused the previous failure at the political end, we cannot really judge whether the proposed new system will be adequate to ensure such a failure does not recur in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">In many ways, I am in favour of the mechanics of the legislation but this fundamental problem remains.  We should work on it now; we cannot wait any longer.  This Bill does not provide the answer because we should know at this stage what caused the problems of the past but we have not even started.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">There has been a report in Iceland, which had an even more spectacular failure.  That report is complete and I understand it runs to nine volumes and was published some weeks ago.  There was no restraint in that report.  It ladled out the blame where it was clearly established.  Regardless of who the individuals were, they were pinpointed.  The real question is why this has not happened here.  One must be driven to a certain conclusion.  I am long enough in the House now not to get into political slagging, but the suspicion exists that the reason for the delay in carrying out an analysis, an examination and a report is the fear of the Government that the finger of suspicion would point at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I recall the mantra of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the then Minister for Finance and all the Ministers.  It was that there were no problems and that the fundamentals were sound.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">The view was that if anyone made any suggestion that the fundamentals were not 100% sound, he or she was virtually betraying the country.  It was unpatriotic even to think of it, never mind to suggest it.  This is the reason we do not have such a report or analysis and it is a basic difficulty I have with the Bill.  In many ways, we are putting the cart before the horse.  We are attempting to solve a problem without really knowing its causes or without having a real analysis of same.  We are flying blind.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">People have stated that no one could have known anything like this would happen and no one knew about the machinations that went on in banking circles.  One of the best books I read some years ago was called <i>Liar’s Poker</i> by Michael Lewis.  He gave an insider’s account of the graft, greed and corruption involved in building up the bonuses of those working in a particular financial institution.  He gave a blow by blow account.  It was quite clear that the first item on the agenda in all transactions was how much one could squeeze out of them for the individual involved and for the bank for which that individual was working.  Every client was a fat goose to be plucked.  In the book, Michael Lewis detailed exactly how it was done.  A bank collapsed, but it was not Lehman Brothers.  The bank about which he wrote was Salomon Brothers, which went bust 20 years earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Anyone who was involved in the business of financial regulation or supposed to be involved in the system of supervision and monitoring had a prototype of the carry-on that was unfolding in these financial institutions.  It was written by an insider who had been directly involved.  He admitted he was involved in the activities about which we are now so horrified and surprised and about which the regulators and those supervising the business had no clue.  No one knew anything about it.  Were they all blind?  I presume there was a relevant official section in the Department of Finance.  Was any Government official or anyone in the Central Bank or the regulator's office aware?  Did anyone else hold even the slightest suspicion that the same activities were taking place under our eyes in this country?  Apparently, it was happening under their noses but they did not have the slightest suspicion.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The warnings were there.  I do not refer to the 20 year old blueprint in <i>Liar’s Poker</i> which set out how it was to be done, but all the warning signals were there nevertheless, including the greatly inflated profits that were being made.  I have been involved in business, politics and law for a long time.  Sometimes when one is making inflated profits one may be inclined to believe it is too good to be true, but it is and it was too good to be true.  However, no one seemed to have the slightest idea that these highly inflated profits, the magical growth in such firms as Anglo Irish Bank and the multi-million euro bonuses, were suspect.  It appeared those involved were bankers walking on water, who could do so with impunity and then take off with fat, million euro bonuses in their pockets.  The warning signals were everywhere and should have been obvious to anyone who had any function whatever in supervising the shambles that was about to unfold.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I have been reading the <i>Economist</i> for many years.  I recall it warned about the bubble that was developing in Ireland some five years ago.  It reported that the number of units being constructed exceeded total construction in the entire United Kingdom, a place with a population some 15 times greater than ours.  It warned about what was happening but no notice was taken.  I refer to another aspect that has not been sufficiently explored.  What was the relationship between the bank and other financial institutions and those dealing with such institutions?  Was the person dealing with it a customer or a client?  Was there a duty of care to that person?  Was there a fiduciary relationship?  Was it just a limited contractual relationship in which the fat goose waited to be plucked, even though it was nominally a client or customer of the bank?  Under the new system, will these institutions owe any responsibility to their clients or customers?  Is it a professional relationship at all?</p>
          <p eId="para_622">When one follows the hearings that are taking place in the United States at the moment, with regard to certain exploits at Goldman Sachs, one wonders whether they could happen here under the current system.  If not, why not?  What protections are preventing it from happening?  Will it be able to happen under the new system?  When one considers the relationships at Goldman Sachs, one has to wonder what duty of care was owed by the institution to its clients.  Without prejudging the outcome of those hearings, I have to say there does not appear to be much evidence of fiduciary care on the part of those involved in that transaction.  That leads into the question of ethical responsibility.  Are there guidelines that set out ethical responsibilities in this area?  Are there no ethics?  Is it a case of every man and woman for himself or herself, and let the devil take the hindmost?  What is the Government's approach to ethical standards, at least in the future if not in the past?</p>
          <p eId="para_623">This issue is of some relevance because these problems are continuing to happen today.  What responsibility does a financial institution have to its clients?  I have come across the case — I had some discussions on it today — of an established bank that is dealing with a small company that has 30 or 40 employees and is doing plenty of work, thanks be to God.  When the company applied to have its overdraft of €500,000 renewed, the matter was considered.  It is not an exceptional amount for a company that has been in operation for 21 years and has been dealing with the bank in question throughout that time.  The company was notified on a Monday morning that the overdraft was not being renewed — in fact, it was being reduced to €200,000, with effect from a date four days later.  What kind of way is that for an established bank to do business with an established customer?  Many issues of this nature need to be explored.  I intend to suggest a means by which that can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The future role of the financial institutions is another issue that has not been considered in this debate.  Anglo Irish Bank has been nationalised and the other main banks have been part-nationalised.  What are the responsibilities of those working in such banks?  I hope they will not be concerned with trying to get inflated bonuses for themselves.  To what extent are they answerable to the boards, shareholders and customers of the banks?  Does their business essentially amount to increasing the profit line of the banks, with little or no emphasis on increasing their underlying value in the interests of customers or clients?  On the question of pay and bonuses, bankers have always told me that if one pays peanuts, one will get monkeys.  The bloody trouble for us was that in many cases, we paid millions and we got monkeys nevertheless.  In some instances, it was worse than that — it was clearly a case of criminal negligence that will cost taxpayers for decades to come.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">There were instances of sharp practice.  People who took no risks and added no value to clients or customers ran off with multi-million bonuses stuffed into their pockets.  Will that happen in the future?  If not, why not?  When I spoke to people about this issue, I was often told it was an international question.  The monkeys compared themselves to monkeys in other jurisdictions who were doing exactly the same thing.  We were expected to accept that it was okay.  How will that be dealt with in the future?  I believe the labourer is worthy of his hire.  There are people who are very good at this business, but they are few enough and far between.  We need to establish a system that allows those who do a good job to be adequately rewarded.  Essentially, how can we separate the good, the bad and the ugly?</p>
          <p eId="para_627">A number of other issues have not been mentioned during this debate.  What is the Government's attitude to the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax?  Such a proposal, which would involve introducing a levy on a wide range of financial transactions, has been around for a long time.  What is the attitude of the Government to the International Monetary Fund's proposed financial stability contribution, which would meet the fiscal cost of any future Government support for the financial sector?  What is its attitude to the proposed financial activities tax?  When one thinks about some of the fat cats who are around, it is appropriate that the tax is delightfully abbreviated as the FAT.  There has been no debate here on the FAT, which would operate as a tax on remuneration, profits and bonuses.  What is the Government's attitude to it?  Has there been an adequate debate on the merits of principles-based regulation, as opposed to rules-based regulation?</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I would like to conclude by focusing on monitoring and oversight.  What is the best practice in that regard?  Regardless of the outcome of the theological argument on the differences between principles-based and rules-based regulation, it is essential that there is proper and genuine monitoring and oversight on the part of the Minister of the day, the appropriate section in the Department of Finance, the regulatory authorities within the Central Bank and the Oireachtas.  I have called for years for the establishment of a standing committee of the Oireachtas to deal with banking affairs.  It could be modelled on the Committee of Public Accounts, to some degree.  Such a committee should be adequately resourced.  Obviously, it would not interfere with day-to-day decision-making.  It would be able to discuss broad issues of relevance in public.  If questions could be answered transparently and openly by the top people in financial institutions, we would get the accountability that is needed, which is a major issue.  While the Bill proposes that certain functions be given to the Oireachtas, I do not believe it goes half far enough.  We need a standing Oireachtas committee on banks to be established.  It would play a major role in ensuring that the kinds of failures which have occurred in the past do not arise again in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_415">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_629">It is timely for the House to be considering the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010.  The various points raised by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, sufficiently illustrate the need for reform or, if not reform, total and absolute application of the regulations that are already in place.  On 29 September 2008, this House and the country as a whole became aware of some of the implications of certain actions, from a financial and budgetary perspective, such as the hardship that was likely to be inflicted on the Irish people.  I mentioned at the time that the Governor of the Central Bank, certain officials in the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator were at fault and should be fired, unless it was the case that they were carrying out Government instructions.  Whenever something extraordinary happens in any Department — in relation to child abuse, crime or anything else — it is always decided that there is a need to introduce legislation but there is never much regard for the failure to recognise the legislation that was already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The latest phrase we hear is "systemic failure".  The system did not fail, but many of the people within it failed.  Many of the people who oversaw the system failed.  Many of the people who were in positions of power, authority and direction failed.  The people and the country paid and will continue to pay for many years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I refer to previous debates in the House.  Why does everybody decide something should be done after the crisis?  There were procedures in place to alert everybody to what was happening long before it happened.  Did somebody come forward and say, "We could not do that because there were no regulations, accounting procedures or guidelines.  The fundamentals are not quite right."?  They were not, and have not been for the past ten years.  Everybody knows that, but nobody wants to be seen to admit it.  I cannot understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I thought at this stage in the debate somebody would have stood up and said we now have a serious problem.  The problem was that nothing was done by the people in authority or by the people who give direction to the people in authority.  As a result, the nation and everybody in it now pays.  I have said many times during the passage of legislation in this House that I would like to know if the Bill, when it is passed by the House, is likely to have a serious impact.  Will it be seriously adhered to by the people for whom the Bill was produced in the first place?  I am not referring to the ordinary citizen, but the people in control, those with power and direction, those in Government and the relevant Ministers and authorities.  I see no indication that is likely to happen, which is unfortunately the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I am a member of the much-maligned Committee of Public Accounts which sat to examine issues of this nature under the DIRT inquiry some years ago.  It was brought to the attention of the members of the committee at that time that various Acts of Parliament were ignored at crucial times.  Nobody could be found ultimately responsible.  There was a reference to a vague statutory instrument which could not be tracked down to anybody in particular.  The consequences for the country and the running of it were colossal, as was the collection of taxes which were due.  It was a regulatory system.  At that time there was also a tax amnesty.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">What has happened since is nothing more than a total and cavalier disregard for every lesson, issue and direction given by the legislators in this House at that time.  Why did that happen?  We came to believe that we were the wealthiest country in the world.  What a lot of codology.  What a laugh.  We were never the wealthiest country in the world.  We pretended we were, just like those who said they would pay themselves because they were good and deserved it.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">In the past week all of us have had the honour of being the subject of a media investigation into whether we qualified for or received pensions, and whether we were illegally receiving pensions and if we would give them up voluntarily.  I say without the slightest hesitation that I have no difficulty in not drawing down a pension because it is insignificant in any event.  However, I have difficulty with a smokescreen being created which is of benefit to those who want one at the current time.  Serious issues which affect the budgetary situation in this country were rejected by the European institutions in the past week and were discovered as being seriously remiss.  There has not been a single word about it.  It is an issue which will put a further liability of billions of euro on the backs of the people and taxpayers of this country for the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">There has not been a word of inquiry from the media at all because they have been well and truly harnessed.  I feel sorry for them.  They have been hijacked by the Government or by forces in this country who have an interest in this issue.  This week we should have been discussing the implications of the decision by EUROSTAT regarding off-balance sheet accounting which has become commonplace and was commonplace in many institutions in this country.  I cannot understand why we have not had a debate on that issue.  I cannot understand why the whole country has not come to a halt and said, "What is happening here?  Why has something not been done about this?".</p>
          <p eId="para_637">We have been discovered at last.  All of a sudden there was a major issue about pensions.  It was a satisfactory smokescreen.  I often wonder whether somebody has hypnotised the media into the belief that this is where the real pot of gold is because they should have been focused in a different direction.  I want to dwell on this point for a moment.  We now live in an era of experts.  We have experts to tell us about virtually everything we want to do.  We have experts who want to tell us when, how and where to invest, how to make more money, be better and move ahead more quickly in the world and how to be faster and more glib than anybody else.  However, we do not have any experts who seem to want to adhere to fundamental structures, guidelines and regulations which have been put in place for a purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">It was well known in this country for at least eight or nine years that the normal guidelines which applied to the financial and banking sector were no longer being observed.  It was a fact of life.  Three or four people in the media were the only ones who raised questions about it.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and people on this side of the House also referred to it.  Every time anybody drew attention to that issue, he or she was denigrated and cast out as being unpatriotic, unfit to be Irish, not proud of the nation and no longer a proper citizen.  That is what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">There are guidelines laid down in financial and banking services which require certain procedures in regard to borrowing, lending and back-to-back loans, all of which we discussed and dealt with at length during the DIRT inquiry many years ago.  All of this information was available.  Everything had been learned and done and dusted before.  A short time ago we were bigger and better and the fundamentals were right.  The fundamentals have not been right for at least eight to ten years.  The quicker we recognise that in this House, the better.  If we do not recognise that smokescreens do not solve the problem, what the real issues are and their full implications, and the full and likely impact on the country and the political and financial systems, we are wasting our time.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I do not want to be confrontational; it is of no benefit to me whatsoever as an Opposition politician.  I find it extraordinary when the media concentrates on the politicians and the Members of this House.  This is Parliament; it debates and the Government makes the commitments.  The Government comes into the House — in a democracy it must always have a majority unless there is a hung Parliament — and disposes.  That is what has happened here, and the country has paid the price for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">There were many experts in the so-called good days.  If we want to find out whether they were good days, we should ask any small businessperson, shopkeeper or man or woman who manages a household budget in the country.  They know where everything went wrong and they told us then that this could not last and this was crazy stuff.  Nobody wanted to stop because everybody was having a good time.  Now the emphasis in on punishing the most readily available victim.  That is what happened in the French Revolution.  Another guillotine was set up to appease the crowd, which was dissatisfied.  A dangerous scenario could emerge unless normality is restored.  It can only be restored when there is clear commitment that those who are given the responsibility to oversee discharge their duties, carry out their functions and ensure regulations are observed to the letter; otherwise, we are wasting our time.  The way it is looking, the people who were charge with these responsibilities will not pay.  They will escape and move away to a far flung place where the sun shines and from where they can talk back to us as if they have done no wrong.  We will get one chance at this.  We need to restore public confidence not in politicians or the institutions of the State, but in those who were given well paid jobs in these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I am not a spokesman for the Taoiseach or a Minister.  Many of those who failed to do their job, as a result of which the country is paying heavily, were paid multiples of the salary of the Taoiseach, prime ministers in other jurisdictions and even the US President.  What are we at?  Today, the media are occupied with somebody's pension.  In the order of importance, where are we going?  The media will say what they are doing is about perception and it is the right thing to do.  That is an education at this stage.  If the right things were done, we would not be in the position we are now.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I often wonder where people obtain their information.  I received an e-mail earlier from a poor, unfortunate guy who was probably genuinely expressing his view.  He said he had a terribly hard year in 2009, having worked 60 hours a week, and he paid his taxes and so on.  He did not say this but I presume he had come to the conclusion that Members of both Houses had a much easier time.  I assure everyone that I worked more than 120 hours a week last year.  I did not claim credit for that nor do I wish to do so.  That is the job we do.  However, I like to think other Members and I do the job to the best of our ability without expertise, without reference to advisers and spin doctors and without excuses afterwards because any decision we make, we stand over.  That is the job we are elected to do and, at the end of the day, we go before the people again to secure another mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">If we continue to cloud the issues and raise smokescreens in the way we have, we will be found out in a much more serious way.  Suddenly, European institutions and other international bankers will awaken to what is happening in Ireland and they will have a good look at the institutions here and the people running them.  They will not look for outside experts because they will look for the experts who are in place and who were allegedly carrying out a function.  They will ask why they did not carry out the function and why they have continued not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">There have been financial crises in other jurisdictions but it is also necessary to recognise that we had a great deal to do with our own problems.  We did not need imports.  We did it so well that it would make a great film even covering the ten-year period it took to do it.  At the end of the day, the people who are deemed to be the culprits for the situation in which we find ourselves are the politicians, not the Government or the Ministers who were in direct control at the time and those who were in institutions such as the Central Bank and the Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator.  In God's name, what were they doing?  Were they at their desks?  If so, were they awake?  They cost the country dearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I do not see any stomach in the media or elsewhere for somebody to carry out a serious investigation into what happened.  Worse still, this could happen again.  In the same way we had the DIRT inquiry and the scam associated with it, light fingered regulation could be repeated.  There was clearly a disregard for all the regulations in place and, ultimately, the country will pay.  The sad part is people on social welfare and those whose mortgages are several months in arrears and who are in danger of having their houses repossessed will pay in a severe and serious way for the nonchalance of those in charge of the system who had no regard for what was happening.  They will pay again and again as long as there is disregard for the regulations in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I referred to the need for change but there is no need to amend the legislation.  The regulations are in place but they just need to be put into operation.  Why is the Government hiding behind camouflage whereby every time there is a crisis, the answer is to introduce more legislation?  That has never worked.  Where emergencies arose over the past number of years, it was clear the necessary regulation and legislation was in place.  However, the problem was somebody decided to ignore it.  The people running the system have failed, not the system itself, and until those charged with responsibility for the system recognise the job they are supposed to do and come forward, put their hands up and accept that responsibility, we are wasting our time in the House.  We are debating in a vacuum.  The debate will have no impact on the future or the past and it will only cause the public to have even less confidence than they have in what they see as the culprits for, and the cause of, the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Dáil committees are deemed to be necessary because of the success of the DIRT inquiry.  It is cited as the epitome of how inquiries should be carried out.  However, there is only one thing wrong with this proposition.  There are powerful vested interests in all the services in this country and when a committee of the House, as opposed to the courts, goes into investigative mode, gets close to the target and begins to pinch those who feel threatened, there will be a reaction.  It will be sinister, punitive, dangerous and intimidating and the success of the investigative procedure will be determined by the degree to which Members will be committed to take the hit and the criticism that will go with it and to do their job.  That will be an example for those throughout the system who did not do their job for a long number of years.</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_653">noting that:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_654">the Irish economy is experiencing one of the worst recessions of any developed country;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_655">unemployment, which stood at less than 5% in 2008, is forecast to reach nearly 14% by the end of 2010, with the live register currently at more than 435,000;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_656">some 100,000 people are expected to leave Ireland in a two year period;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_657">there remains a significant infrastructure deficit which undermines competitiveness, constrains productivity, threatens recovery and puts at risk our ability to continue attracting high value-added inward investment; and</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_658">firms must have access to working capital and growth capital, but the banking crisis has seriously impaired the capacity of Irish banks to lend to the SME sector and to start-ups with high-growth potential;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_659">deploring the failure of the Government to produce a coherent strategy for jobs and investment or to address the funding and infrastructure gaps;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_660">calls for the establishment of a Strategic Investment Bank (SIB) with the primary objective of investing and lending for national economic development, including investment in infrastructure and the enterprise sector and which would be broadly modelled on the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), and on the ICC/ACC (Industrial Credit Corporation/Agricultural Credit Corporation) models that previously operated in Ireland and which would be based on the following principles:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_661">SIB will have full operational independence from the Government;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_662">SIB would be capitalised by equity investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_663">SIB would originate funding for infrastructure projects it deems to be appropriate;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_664">SIB would be tasked with improving the funding environment for SMEs, particularly high-tech start-ups, addressing existing market failures; and</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_665">SIB would make no distribution of profits and all profits would be retained to increase the capital base of the bank."</p>
            <p eId="para_666">This motion is basically about jobs.  From the beginning of the economic crisis, the Labour Party has made the point, again and again, that jobs are the key to recovery.  Every person who loses a job is another person claiming a social welfare entitlement, another person whose mortgage might be in difficulty.  Every time a job is created the Exchequer gains tax income, more money is being spent in the shops.  It is that simple.  If we want to fix the banking crisis and the fiscal crisis, we must have a clear strategy on employment, but that is precisely what has not been forthcoming from this Fianna Fáil Government.  At the time of the last budget, the Labour Party supported the objective of achieving a €4 billion adjustment in the public finances.  But we argued then, as we have argued since, that unless that adjustment was accompanied by a jobs strategy, the danger was that the cure would kill the patient or certainly worsen its condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">A major feature of the recession has been the huge increase in the savings ratio, as consumers lost confidence in the Government and in the future of the Irish economy.  The ESRI is forecasting that this increase in savings will take approximately €7 billion out of the economy in 2010.  That drainage is reinforcing the impact of the budget cuts.  A coherent jobs strategy would help to restore consumer confidence, increase spending and create jobs.  The Labour Party's strategic investment bank should be a key plank in Ireland's jobs strategy.  Its structure and role would make a major contribution to the immediate task of promoting recovery, while also playing a central role in the transformation and restructuring of the economy and move away from the casino capitalism of Fianna Fáil, to restore this country to an export-led growth model where we pay our way in the world through the quality of what we produce and sell.  To achieve that goal, we need investment finance.  We need finance for investment in the infrastructure of a 21st century knowledge economy, and we need finance for investment in the firms that will grow up around that infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">What is clear is that this necessary finance will not be provided by a banking system that is hobbled by the legacy of greed and excess.  Even with NAMA, and with the various recapitalisations, it is clear that Irish banks will not be in a position to support investment in innovative businesses and in key infrastructure.  The primary focus of the Irish banks in the coming years will be on shrinking their balance sheets and increasing their profits.  It will not be on supporting investment in the future of the economy nor do the banks have a strong record in this regard.  As the Governor of the Central Bank has recently stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_669">I think it's fair to say — and what data we have seem to bear this out — that banks in Ireland reacted to their own difficulties and to the downturn by greatly reducing their risk appetite.  Some of this was a necessary adjustment, but the result has been limited availability of credit for start-up firms and SMEs.  Indeed, I have the impression that, during the years of property-based lending, the banks have lost their edge in small business lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">As banks repair and shrink their balance sheets, it is unlikely this position will be reversed.  The Government has made all manner of promises about the flow of credit to business.  It has made all kinds of noises about getting tough with the banks and demanding that they lend.  It has put in place various bureaucratic measures to promote lending, but it made the same promises about bankers' pay, and then it systematically undermined its own guidelines.  What we need now, therefore, is a new ‘greenfield' bank with a clear mission to support investment in SMEs and innovative firms, and to assist in the funding of infrastructural investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">The Labour Party's proposal for a strategic investment bank has been set out in our policy paper, Investing in Our Future.  Our proposal is that the strategic investment bank would be based on the twin models of the German investment bank, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW, and on the Irish experience with ICC and ACC.  Both of these are successful models that have proven track records.  The bank would be capitalised with an initial €2 billion investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, allowing it to make loans of up to €20 billion over time.  Despite the many problems that we face, we can and should be optimistic about the future of the economy.  We live in a time of great economic change, driven by trade and by stunning technological advances, which present great economic opportunities for Ireland if we seize them.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">In only a few decades, digital and biotechnology have revolutionised large parts of the economy.  Normally, when we think about the knowledge economy we think of computers, pharmaceuticals, electronic communications, scientific instruments, chemicals, and finance, but the knowledge economy is not, and will not be, confined to a few sectors.  Technological change will also drive growth across the rest of the economy.  It has changed and will change retailing, the food industry, and creative industries such as media and newspapers.  As technological change feeds though into other sectors, productivity across the economy can grow.  In any workplace technology can be applied to other intangible assets such as research, design, development, creativity , science and branding.  Putting the technology together with these knowledge assets will drive economic growth which will be assisted by globalisation, as hundreds of millions of people are brought into the global trading system.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">The so-called BRIC economies — Brazil, Russia, India and China — account for 40% of the world's population and only 25% of its income, something that will change in the years ahead.  The countries that succeed in the knowledge economy will be those that understand it best, that embrace it and adapt to it and understand how the knowledge economy changes the common sense way of doing things.  The challenge we face as a country is to embrace that economy and to turn it to our advantage, even more than we have done up to now, and to do that we need investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">A sustainable investment-driven, knowledge-based economy is one where innovation is promoted across all sectors, where there is an environment that promotes firm start-up and expansion, and where there is a commitment to the provision of world-class infrastructure.  Those are closely linked.  Investment in infrastructure such as renewable energy, next-generation fibre networks, smart grids and electric transport will create the environment for a new wave of indigenous companies focused on the huge opportunities that will arise as a result of the expansion of digital technologies and the transition to a low-carbon economy in the coming decades.  Those companies must also have access to working capital and growth capital, and to a range of other supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">The strategic investment bank is designed to meet that investment need.  One of its main areas of investment will be in infrastructure, whether privately owned or publicly provided.  In a footnote to budget 2010, the Government stated that it had approved a capital spending envelope of approximately €39 billion for the seven-year period 2010 to 2016.  The Taoiseach has since restated that figure in various speeches.  However, while the Department of Finance claims that a review of spending priorities has been undertaken, no new plan for capital spending has been published.  That is extraordinary.  The Government is effectively admitting that the national development plan has been abandoned, and a new plan put in place, but it will not tell anyone what is that plan.  The profile for capital spending, set out in budget 2010, shows nominal spending of €6,466 million in 2010, or approximately 5% of GNP.  This is projected to fall to €5,500 million in 2011 and for each year to 2014.  In effect, the nominal amount of spending will stay the same, but it will fall as a share of GNP.  On the basis of reasonable assumptions about growth in 2015 and 2016, capital spending will fall from approximately 5% of GNP in 2010, to approximately 3.1% in 2016, averaging approximately 3.8% of GNP for the period as a whole.  While that is a substantial commitment on the part of the State, it falls well short of the 5% figure to which the Government was previously committed.  It also falls short of the level of investment the ESRI identified as being necessary in its last major study in this area, which was completed in 2006.  Although this report is now dated, the fact remains that Ireland needs a new programme of investment to reposition its economy and to create jobs.  The investment economy cannot be realised unless we look to innovative solutions.  We need a fresh approach to investing in innovation and to financing and developing infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">There have been a number of proposals made in this area that the Government has committed to examining but which have never produced any action.  While the Government long ago committed itself to the principle of non-traditional financing through public-private partnerships, PPPs, its implementation of that approach has been fragmented and weak.  The cost of PPPs has been the subject of some criticism.  The banking crisis has dramatically reduced the level of interest in PPPs among potential investors.  The availability of finance for PPP projects from both domestic and foreign banks has effectively dried up since the credit crisis began.  Where finance is still available, it is for shorter periods than the life of the infrastructure project in question and at a much greater cost, mostly rendering the PPP funding model unviable.  There is nothing to suggest the private banks have any appetite for continuing to finance such projects.  Bidders for Metro North have explicitly stated the Government will have to underwrite the financing risks in order for the project to be completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">What we need to put in place now is a fresh approach, led by a State-owned strategic investment bank.  The Labour Party's proposal is that the strategic investment bank would assist in the financing of investment projects.  The bank would prepare and issue bonds on the international capital markets and issue them to institutional and retail investors to fund these projects.  The private consortium appointed to design, build and operate the project or projects in question would borrow the project funding from the strategic investment bank, and through that bank from other lenders, for a small margin over the coupon the bank would pay on the bond in order to cover its costs.  Strategic investment bank lending would reduce the cost of funds for these projects, resulting in the provision of critical public infrastructure at a lower cost to the public purse and to users of services than the current PPP system, a system that is not functioning effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The model of a State-owned, but commercially focused, investment bank has been successful in other countries, most notably in Germany, and is being examined in other countries, including the United Kingdom.  Our proposal is to couple this role with an SME financing role, given both the urgent need for finance and the need for long-term investment.  As was the case with the ICC, the cost base for such a bank can be very limited.  We envisage an organisation with a handful of office locations around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">Successive CSO figures have painted a grim picture of the appalling jobs crisis that confronts us.  One third of men aged between 20 and 24 and 40% of men under 20 in the workforce are unemployed.  It is not morally or economically sustainable to have such large numbers of people out of work in a country.  The Labour Party has put forward a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the crisis.  It encompasses a jobs fund to support specific interventions, training and educational options of the unemployed and a strategic investment bank to lead the recovery.  The bank would play a central role in the repositioning of the Irish economy for decades to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">We have had many debates in this House on banking and the State committing large sums of money to banks that have participated in and in some cases have been a major cause of the economic crisis we are experiencing.  The Labour Party is proposing the establishment of a strategic investment bank and the committal of funding, through the national pensions reserve fund, to capitalise such a bank.  The bank would loan to SMEs and start-up companies and provide a vehicle to fund the infrastructure the country needs to get its economy moving again.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_419">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_681">This is one of the most important motions to come before this House for a considerable period and one that we in the Labour Party genuinely hope will jolt this Government out of its complacency and lethargy in dealing with one of the most important issues it has not confronted to date, namely, unemployment.  By the beginning of 2011, 14% of our working population could be registered as unemployed.  Were it not for the 60,000 who have emigrated to date, we could well have reached that level by today.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">Notwithstanding the cold winds of recession which are echoing across the world, Ireland did not arrive at its current position by chance; it arrived here by a devotion to unregulated speculative capitalism, as our party president, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has described it.  This has been at a great cost to our population and has been underpinned, with equal force and vigour, by a rejection of any market regulation.  Where market regulation was effected, it was of such a minimalist, light-touch variety as to be largely ineffective.  There has been, of course, a rigorous rejection of State intervention.  The net result of this let-it-rip and spend-like-there-is-no-tomorrow economic philosophy is the number of people who are languishing on the unemployment register, devoid of hope and deserted by the uncaring Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">Unemployment has negative effects that go beyond the loss of income on people of any age.  Unemployment is associated with illness, mental stress, depression and a reduction in life expectancy, and it sometimes impacts negatively on relationships.  Sustained unemployment has very negative long-term consequences for those who experience it when young.  Young people who are unemployed at the beginning of their working lives tend to have lower productivity, lower incomes and poorer labour market experiences later in life.  As the UK economist David Blanchflower, an authority on youth unemployment, has written, "Unemployment while young creates permanent scars rather than temporary blemishes."</p>
            <p eId="para_684">The Labour Party strongly believes that research, development and innovation have a key or central role to play in the development of the Irish economy.  Recently IDA Ireland launched Horizon 2020, its strategic blueprint and roadmap for attracting foreign direct investment into Ireland for the next decade.  Under this strategy, the aim is to create 105,000 new jobs by the end of 2014.  The plan is to attract 640 new foreign direct investments into the country, 50% of which would be targeted for location outside the major centres of Dublin and Cork.  By 2014, IDA Ireland plans to spend in excess of €1.7 billion annually on research, development and innovation to transform the economy and to create high-quality jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">I acknowledge IDA Ireland's document is highly ambitious.  The Labour Party acknowledges the important role that foreign direct investment will play in helping to turn around our economy and rejuvenate enterprise and business.  Attracting and developing high-tech enterprise and investing in research and development will be the key to developing a strong economy and helping to pull Ireland out of the current recession because these measures will create sustainable jobs, increase competitiveness and boost exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">I have no problem saluting the IDA and Enterprise Ireland for the work they are doing in their respective areas, but I must ask why the Government has not prepared a ten-year blueprint to ensure SMEs will prosper and develop.  Up to the beginning of the recession, SMEs numbered about 250,000 in total and created 750,000 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">There has been an abject failure on the part of the Government to recognise that these small businesses, many of which are family owned or operated, were the backbone of the economy and were resilient and adaptable.  They provided from three to 12 jobs in many villages and towns across this country and were instrumental in maintaining the social fabric of rural communities.  Instead of coming to the aid of some of these enterprises to help secure them against the cold winds of this recession, the Government has virtually abandoned them.  They feel this and tell us so every day.  The Labour Party is committed to supporting enterprise and supporting in every way possible the job creation capacity and potential of our indigenous small to medium firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">The Government has concentrated its energy and resources on fixing the banking crisis and on attempting to address the fiscal circumstances but has failed to address the significant and fundamental problems of the real economy, such as the plight of the unemployed.  We have witnessed an increase of 250,000 in the number of people who have been registered as unemployed in the past two years and there are forecasts that there could be another 60,000 to 70,000 on the live register before the end of the year.  That is assuming a do-nothing approach, which seems to have the Government in a state of paralysis.  It is a case of doing nothing to tackle this fundamental issue.  Let us not forget that these figures would be significantly worse were it not for the fact that the emigration ships and aeroplanes have started up again and in the space of two short years they will take 100,000 of our people — who number among them those best educated and best equipped to help get us out of this recession — to foreign shores.  That is the legacy of this failed Government's policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">We know the banks have lost their edge in small business lending.  They do not appear to have the capacity to lend to SMEs and to firms with high growth potential.  Therefore, it is abundantly clear that we need a new investment bank to address the project capital and SME funding gaps that are glaringly apparent and which will play a crucial role in helping to reduce unemployment.  Viable businesses are being forced out of business.  I do not want the Minister of State to tell me that is an exaggeration because it is happening.  Others are being prevented from expanding by the shortage of credit and new ones with potential are being denied an opportunity to get off the ground at all.  This is why the Labour Party has launched a proposal for the establishment of a strategic investment bank, which we believe would play a central role in the recovery and transformation of the economy.  We believe that Ireland must be weaned off its dependence on property and consumer credit, and be re-invented as an export-led sustainable investment economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The strategic investment bank, which we propose here again this evening and as alluded to in great detail by our party leader, Deputy Gilmore, would represent a new greenfield bank modelled on a mixture of the ICC-ACC concept, a model which was kernel to the KfW banking group in Germany.  It would have a clear mission to support investment in SMEs and innovative firms and to assist in the funding of infrastructural investment.  Labour has always argued that necessary action to deal with the banking crisis and the budget deficit must be accompanied by a strategy for jobs.  The party's deputy leader and finance spokesperson, Deputy Joan Burton, has always indicated a tripod approach in this regard.  One could never balance a tripod stool with only two legs and I am sure Deputy Calleary knows about milking a cow with a tripod — perhaps he did not do this, but some of us did.  To this end, we know that the SIB would play a vital role in that jobs strategy, securing the existing jobs and creating new ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">The SIB would have a mandate to lend directly to the enterprise sector, providing working capital and growth capital, including asset finance for fixtures and fittings or for capital equipment.  Those are the lifeblood of sustaining businesses, replacing depreciated items with modern technology.  If required, it could make venture capital investments on behalf of the State.  That is no longer a poisoned term.  Some people recoil at the thought of the State getting involved in anything, but we do not.  We believe that, where strategically done, this is very worthwhile and would contribute to addressing the problems.  This could be applied especially to innovative SMEs with high growth potential, especially in the digital economy and low carbon technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">Ireland needs investment in infrastructure such as renewable energy and next generation communication networks.  This will create the environment for a new wave of indigenous companies focused on the significant opportunities that will arise as a result of the expansion of digital technologies and the transition to a low carbon economy over the coming decades.  Providing finance for this new innovative economy will be one of the roles of the SIB.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">Creating jobs is the key to getting Ireland moving again and the strategic investment bank is just one of a number of proposals that the Labour Party has advanced as part of our jobs strategy.  I recoil at journalists who are too lazy to look at our policies and who say we have not made proposals to deal with particular areas.  The party leader outlined more of them tonight and the spokesperson on finance is worn out doing this.  However, there are journalists who just want to infer that the Labour Party is not doing anything and is being negative.  We have many positive proposals and we will be happy to send copies to them in the post if they cannot access them on our website.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">We remain autonomous and have sovereign competence, as the Lisbon treaty affirms, in respect of decisions we make on taxation.  Why has a proposal we made in relation to a "PRSI holiday" for up to 18 months in respect of employers' PRSI for a firm which takes on a person who is unemployed for a set period to do a real full-time job, not a replacement job, not been taken on board by the Government as a constructive proposal?</p>
            <p eId="para_695">We are aware that every person on the live register costs more that €20,000 each year in terms of social welfare payments and tax forgone.  We have to be innovative and old solutions dressed up in new clothes are no longer appropriate.  We also need to fund a major programme of further education, training and work experience for young unemployed people.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">Small businesses and micro-entrepreneurs will play a pivotal role in ensuring that we recover quickly and give hope and confidence to our people, especially the 435,000 of our fellow citizens who are currently unemployed.  The core objective of our policy is to replace Fianna Fail's casino economy with a sustainable investment economy, one where innovation is promoted across all sectors, there is an environment that promotes firm start ups and expansion and a real commitment to the provision of world class infrastructure.  These objectives are all clearly linked and it is essential that companies in these sectors have access to working capital, growth capital and a range of other supports.  Improved infrastructure is essential for enhancing Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment.  The SIB will have a key role to play in promoting and sourcing funding for infrastructural investment in appropriate projects, such as in transport, energy, communications and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">The Government's obsession to date was to sort out the banks and despite a lot of lip-service, promises of credit reviews, Mazars reports, etc, there has been a downright failure to provide a credit flow to small and medium-sized enterprises.  NAMA represents an enormous transfer of public money into private hands.  It is a grim example of what the Nobel Prize winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, has called "socialism for the rich, markets for the poor".  We used to be constantly told that markets were all about risk and that in a dynamic market economy, losses and businesses failures are inevitable.  I recall some of the great economists for the banks giving us that particular beauty.  However, they have disappeared into towers.  I know not whether they are ivory, but we have not heard a squeak from them lately.  However, the failure of the markets has to be addressed by socialist solutions so we are back in play, thanks be to God.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">We are told that NAMA is essential in order that banks can begin to lend to job creating enterprise, but there is little evidence that they are doing this or that the Government is willing to compel them to do so, irrespective of the €3 billion provided to each of the main banks.  I have not heard a squeak yet in this regard.  Who is monitoring this and who will control it?  In truth, the Government has very little capacity to ensure that any bank lends to the productive sector of the economy.  Our proposal for the establishment of a strategic investment bank is to remedy this situation, and we are confident that the bank will help address these glaring and obvious market failures.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">People might argue that banks are lending and that our argument here tonight is bogus, but it is not, and we are not alone in articulating this position.  In the past few weeks, ISME, which carries out a bank watch survey on a quarterly basis, confirmed there was clear evidence of a deterioration in bank credit for SMEs, with more than half of loan and overdraft requests refused for the three months up to 1 March 2010, only seven weeks ago.  Everybody is telling us that the sky is blue all the time and the banks are handing out money.  Someone I know who sought a €2,000 addition to his overdraft was told he was lucky to be hanging on to the €5,000 facility he had already.  This is Walter Mitty stuff from the Government.  The survey concluded that 55% of businesses were refused lending, business closures and job losses were directly linked to lack of credit and Government intervention was urgently required to save thousands of businesses.  This is not the Labour Party saying this, but rather an institution at the coalface dealing with those businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">ISME concluded the reality was that the banks were looking after their own interests and shoring up their balance sheets to the detriment of the rest of the economy.  I believe everyone in the House knows that.  ISME called for the introduction of a "third banking force to compete with the big two", with a particular emphasis on SME lending, and it said the Government must use the influence of its shareholding in the banks to force them to start supporting their SME customers.  The Minister for Finance has announced that he is going to force the banks to lend €6 billion to the SME sector.  Although this is welcome, it must be monitored.  Who will monitor this and will they come back with the same report?</p>
            <p eId="para_701">The recent Mazars report on SME lending, which was funded by the Irish Banking Federation, asserted that there was only a slight decrease in bank lending to SMEs and a higher approval rate by the banks between October to December 2009.  ISME and all of us in the real world have rubbished the report findings and from our contact with individuals and businesses who have had contact with their banks, seeking new funding or trying to negotiate the retention of existing facilities, we are of the view that the findings of that report are questionable to say the least.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">The time is right for the establishment of a new strategic investment bank — it is right for our national economic and infrastructural development.  It is right for small and medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurs and individuals and it is right for our country at this critical juncture. Let us go and do this now.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">I endorse the concept of the Labour Party motion, and I will address the Sinn Féin amendment in detail in a few moments, after addressing the general issue of this evening's debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">There is no doubt the banks are playing no role in funding SMEs and creating a flow of credit to businesses.  I am sure other Members of the House are no different from me in that they are receiving representation after representation, in stories and anecdotes, about the difficulties faced by small businesses — in many cases, two or four person operations — in staying afloat.  When we consider the mainstream banks we find they are constipated with corruption in the higher echelons of the senior executives, which is most unfortunate.  Even when talking to the clerks and tellers who deal with the public, one finds they are embarrassed about what has been going on.  I hope the public can distinguish between these two sets of people when considering what has happened in the banks.  The people at the coalface cannot take abuse from the public, as was happening not too long ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">It is critical that we find a mechanism for ensuring that businesses receive funding.  Jobs are being lost and we must establish something quickly.  I am not convinced for one moment that the Government's measures, token as they are, will do anything to prevent the haemorrhaging of these jobs.  I was at an ISME conference in 2008 at which speaker after speaker described the near impossibility of obtaining funding.  This was two years ago, and the situation certainly has not improved in all this time.  What this demonstrates is that all through the period of the economic and banking crisis, the Government has sat there and recapitalised the banks without dealing with the core issue.  The banks simply do not have finance to hand out.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">I spoke to a constituent this morning — a person with a small manufacturing business — who had proposed to increase his workforce from the current eight to 16, but is enduring a nightmare in trying to obtain funding from the banks.  Even though they accept that his business is viable and his profitability is solid — although, like everyone else's, it is down — they are still making it almost impossible for him to obtain money.  Is it any wonder this is the case, when we consider that the banks have lost their capacity to evaluate customers coming in?  The Government has authorised Enterprise Ireland officials to go into the banks and sit with their staff, because they have some skills in this regard from evaluating companies for grant purposes.  They have experience in evaluating the viability of businesses and it was a good move on the part of the Government to send those officials to give the staff the benefit of their experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">Let us think about this for a moment.  Enterprise Ireland, a State agency, is sending in people to train bankers in banking.  It beggars belief that we have come to this.  A State agency which technically has nothing whatsoever to do with banking is sending in officials to try to retrain bankers in the core fundamentals of their work.  This says much about the position we are in as a country.  It is most unfortunate.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">I agree with about 90% of the Labour Party motion.  However, I do not think it is necessary for us to start from scratch to build a new strategic investment bank — bricks, mortar and all — and to acquire the whole business.  The State has put considerable amounts of money into Allied Irish Banks up to this point and it is clear further recapitalisation will be required.  It would be much simpler to nationalise the bank — it is almost there anyway.  We should put it out of its misery and bring it over the threshold.  AIB has a large infrastructure, with at least one branch in every medium-sized town in Ireland and two in many of the bigger towns, and very good coverage in the cities.  It would be considerably more cost-effective to utilise that resource, given that we are to own it shortly anyhow — we virtually own it at the moment.  It would represent a rescue of a bank that is on the brink and that everybody knows is in pain.  If it were an animal one would do the decent thing and put it down.  That would be a better approach.  However, I entirely agree with the principle of the Labour Party motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">My party has been saying for 20 years now that we need a State bank.  If we had had a State bank in the past 20 years — particularly in the past four or five years — we would not be in the mess we are now, or at least not to the same extent, in terms of the banking system or the economy.  One would expect, and we could ensure, that a State bank would not participate in the messing in which the other banks were engaged.  There would be a standard of decency there.  There would not be any need to retrain bankers in the basic fundamentals of banking, and they would have been able to conduct their business honestly and fairly.  Of course, had there been a State bank it would have been criticised from on high for not performing efficiently, because it would not have been able to keep up with the Fingletons and the Fitzpatricks.  However, there is no doubt they would have been able to run a steady ship through all of it.  We had an example of this in the past in the form of the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Deputy Gilmore's opening this evening stated that the issue was that of jobs.  This is something for which we in Sinn Féin have been preaching for a considerable time.  Jobs are the bottom line.  We need to get people back to work and to create a stream of income to the Exchequer in the form of taxes.  We must give confidence to local economies — to people who run corner shops or garage industries such as engineering.  The way the banks are structured currently and their lending policies do not provide confidence.  Until now they simply have not had money to give, but that was their own fault because they were not coming clean with the figures.  We learned at every turn that the situation was worse than they had been telling us.  The result is that engineers and other educated young people — people in whom the State and its taxpayers have invested considerably — are heading for the planes and boats.  It is unacceptable that we are sending people abroad when there is really no need for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">I would appreciate if the Minister could address one issue.  I agree with previous speakers that there is no evidence the Government is on top of the jobs situation.  It has not found the corresponding piece in the jigsaw puzzle of the economic crisis.  A policy must be introduced and adequately funded to stimulate job creation and to get people back to work.  There are any amount of infrastructural projects out there.  The Minister of State, coming from Mayo, will be more than aware of the infrastructural deficits, not just along the western seaboard but across the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">The Government has been operating on the public private partnership method of funding major infrastructure for some time now.  Yet examination after examination has demonstrated that it is an extremely expensive way to fund infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">None of us wants the National Pensions Reserve Fund to be depleted but we would like some of its funds to be used to stimulate jobs and give a boost to the Irish economy which would have the knock-on effect I described earlier.  The PPP approach is a crazy Thatcherite system that could only be supported by the likes of the Progressive Democrats, which clearly remains influential given that the Government continues to pursue this approach.  Of course, many people who possess that party's mentality——</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Labour Party for moving this motion.  I did not expect to receive advice on milking cows but when Deputy Penrose stands up to speak, one never knows what he will say.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">The difficult economic and financial situation that Ireland and much of the world faced in the past two years is often referred to as a banking crisis but of course it is much more than that.  The interactions between housing, banking and financial markets, flows of credit, Government finances, consumer spending and the real economy have been complex and unprecedented in many ways.  The situation facing the Government in the autumn of 2008 was quite unlike anything an Irish Government had faced previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">Despite what some commentators would say, there are no quick, cheap or easy solutions.  In dealing with this multifaceted crisis the Government has been careful to listen to advice and examine the actions taken by other countries in earlier crises.  The Government's aim at all stages has been to minimise the harm to the economy and the cost to the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">Without minimising what some people have suffered in this crisis through unemployment or reduced income, it is important to recognise that positive signs for the economy are appearing.  Unemployment shows signs of stabilising, retail sales have picked up and there have been improvements in credit levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The first transfers of loans to NAMA have taken place and it is clear that the NAMA evaluation process has demonstrated a rigour and thoroughness that augur well for success in this vital task.  We have seen the Financial Regulator's assessment of the balance sheets and capital requirements of the banks, and the clear targets he has set for them.  The process of getting Ireland's banks back to where they ought to be and where they can make their proper contribution to the sustainable development of the economy is well on its way.  The very positive news on Monday about Bank of Ireland's recapitalisation is further independent evidence that events are moving in the right direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">There is no doubt that we are experiencing some of the most challenging economic circumstances, nationally and internationally, that we have had to face for many decades.  We have had to meet these challenges by taking tough decisions to help stabilise our budgetary position, repair the banking system, regain Ireland's international competitiveness and invest in new jobs.  Every aspect of Government spending has had to contribute to the adjustments necessary to restore order to the public finances.  These changes have undoubtedly been difficult and I would not for one moment underestimate their impact.  We have to recognise, however, these budgetary adjustments would have been necessary even if there had been no banking aspect to the economic developments of the last two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">In spite of the difficulties, it is important to look to the future and how we can expect to fare as the crisis recedes.  The Government is aware that it is vital for us to continue to invest in our key infrastructure so that we can best position ourselves for the recovery when it comes.  We are identifying the capital projects and programmes that best contribute to economic recovery, including an ongoing assessment of what can be done to support both long-term and direct labour-intensive employment in the delivery of economically valuable infrastructure.  For this reason our Exchequer capital allocation for 2010 amounts to €6.4 billion.  At 5% of GNP, our investment programme remains proportionally high by international standards and in comparison to those of the EU-15 member states.  Some of the highlights of our capital investment programme for 2010 include €1 billion for improving the national roads network; €414 million for local and regional roads improvement and maintenance; €615 million for investment in public transport; over €890 million for social housing; €507 million for the primary and second level school building programmes, which will be further augmented by €72 million in funds carried over from 2009; €444 million for HSE capital investment; €141 million investment in higher education capital, including €46 million for the promotion of science and innovation; and €160 million for investment through the enterprise development agencies.  Over the period 2010 to 2016, Exchequer capital investment will amount to over €39 billion.  This Exchequer capital programme will be supplemented by projects part-funded by private investment in the PPP programme and the investment programmes of the commercial State-sponsored bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The core rationale for our capital investment programme is to ensure that we have the requisite public infrastructure to facilitate a return to growth, which will in turn assist sustainable job creation into the longer term.  In addition, the physical construction activity will in itself help to maintain employment in this sector.  The activity this level of investment can sustain is considerably higher than would have been the case two or three years ago.  The downturn has led to a more competitive construction sector market and we have the opportunity to obtain greater value for money from our capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">This Government places a high value on investment in science, technology and innovation, STI.  Earlier today, I had the pleasure of attending the opening of a new laboratory for the centre for research on adaptive nanostructures and nanodevices at Trinity College Dublin.  Nanoscience accounted for €15 billion worth of exports in 2008 and 48% of incoming investment sponsored by the IDA in 2009 was from companies specialising in research and development.  The smart economy framework prioritises investment in STI.  Science Foundation Ireland, which alongside the Higher Education Authority pioneers much of this work, will receive €274 million in 2010 for enterprise related elements of STI.  This expenditure will be complemented by investment in research capacity under the programme for research in third level institutes, which has greatly improved our science infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">There will continue to be a high level of capital investment through the enterprise development agencies to facilitate a return to enterprise led growth driven by a vibrant exporting sector.  Prioritised investments will help to develop the national skills base, put in place critical infrastructure for a return to growth, help to realise greater economic return from existing infrastructure and make Ireland an attractive location in which to do business.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">The network of major interurban routes, which will be completed this year, is a significant achievement by this Government.  While each of these routes contributes to improving transport efficiency, the impact of the network as a whole will enable us to make a step change in this regard, with decreases in travel times and costs benefiting industry, national competitiveness and quality of life for our citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">Water services investment has been identified as a core area for prioritisation and this year alone €508 million has been allocated for capital investment.  Besides the public health and potential economic benefits, investment in this sector will improve environmental sustainability, assist in meeting various environmental compliance specifications and provide 4,000 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">Complementing our Exchequer investment programme, the Government continues to seek investment through the public private partnership programme.  A number of key infrastructural projects have been earmarked for public private partnerships including the N17-N18, Gort-Tuam scheme, the N11, Gorey-Enniscorthy scheme and the combined N11, Arklow-Newlands Cross junction project.  PPPs have been used to deliver landmark projects such as the Cork School of Music, the new criminal courts complex and the new Dublin convention centre which is due to open later this year.  The Government remains committed to PPPs as a procurement option for appropriate projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">While economic circumstances have required us to curtail our allocation for infrastructural investment, we still retain proportionally one of the larger infrastructure investment programmes in the EU and this is augmented by PPP investment.  By strategic prioritisation of capital investment, coupled with the fact that more can be achieved for our money than heretofore, we can focus on achieving the best results from our investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">As I have outlined, substantial investment in infrastructure continues to take place.  This is being funded through the normal mechanisms of direct Exchequer provision and PPPs.  It is not clear how the proposed strategic investment bank, SIB, would make a significant difference in this area, unless it was conceived as a device to change how spending is presented in Government accounts.  If the proposed SIB were to fund Exchequer investment, borrowing from a State-run bank would be no different from borrowing from a private sector bank, in terms of its impact on the Exchequer's overall position.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">The Government already has a mechanism available through which infrastructural investment can be channelled in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Infrastructure, as a long-term investment, is a natural asset class for the NPRF and the commission is keen to access PPP investments where the risk and return characteristics satisfy its statutory commercial investment mandate.  Potential investment opportunities for the NPRF are expected to arise later this year.  The question of NPRF participation in funding models is entirely a matter for the NPRF Commission in accordance with its statutory investment remit.  The NPRF is committed to offering funding on competitive terms that will meet both its investment objectives and assist in providing the necessary capital to fund the country's infrastructural requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">There has been discussion in this debate about unemployment.  The Government has a policy focused on unemployment.  We have arranged a number of initiatives in the past number of months and we are particularly concerned, as referred to by Deputy Penrose and Deputy Morgan, about the rising levels of male youth unemployment and the growth in long-term unemployment.  The refocusing of Departments such as in the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, will further co-ordinate Government strategy to ensure these vulnerable groups are equipped with the necessary skills for employment as the labour market recovers and grows.  With the economy expected to return to growth later this year, the predictions are that employment will gradually recover in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The Government introduced the enterprise stabilisation fund in 2009.  This fund aims to support viable but vulnerable companies experiencing difficulties and accounts for an investment of €100 million over two years.  The employment subsidy scheme will invest €135 million, creating a subsidy of up to €9,100 for each subsidised job.  The Government is also encouraging employers to create new jobs through reducing the costs associated with employment.  The employer jobs PRSI incentive scheme, will allow an employer to create a new job by taking on a person who has been unemployed for six months or more.  The employer will be fully exempted from the liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment.  Between these schemes the Government is investing €265 million directly into enterprises and safeguarding thousands of jobs and securing our enterprise capability in the process.  In addition the Government is also investing substantial resources in tackling our unemployment problem through the investment of over €1 billion in the provision of a range of labour force measures.  This year, the total number of training and work experience places funded by the Government is expected to increase by around 26,000 to over 180,000 places in total.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">Credit for viable businesses is vital to economic recovery and the Government has taken a range of measures to deal with the issue of access to credit for SMEs since the advent of the banking crisis.  The Minister for Finance has recently announced a number of actions to assist the credit situation in relation to SMEs, including the requirement for €3 billion lending plans for each of the next two years for the two largest banks; the requirement that the two largest banks provide €20 million each for seed capital to Enterprise Ireland-supported projects; and the requirement that the two banks each set up a €100 million fund for environmental, clean energy and innovation projects.  In addition, the requirements are that the banks commit to working with Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Banking Federation to develop sectoral expertise in the modern growth sectors and to explore with Enterprise Ireland and the IBF how best to develop the range of banking services so that Irish SMEs trading internationally can meet the new challenges.  The banks will need to develop expertise and credit products in areas where cash flow rather than assets is the basis for lending.  We hope that this will help develop a banking style that is more effective and more supportive of Irish business.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">These measures build on earlier initiatives such as the 2009 commitment by AIB and Bank of Ireland to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10%; the introduction of the code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprise; the establishment of the credit clearing group, including representatives from the main banks, business interests and State agencies, which in turn identifies specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and, in turn, to seek to identity credit supply solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The NAMA Act has established the credit review process to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA participating banks.  The review process is now available and the first requests for review are beginning to be submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">Mr. John Thrugold has been appointed to monitor this process.  I would encourage Deputy Penrose as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to invite Mr. Thrugold to attend the committee and for that committee to take on the job.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">I have outlined the unprecedented set of interlinked problems the country has faced and also outlined some of the actions the Government has taken to tackle these problems.  I have shown there is evidence that the policies are working.  I have given an account of how the Government has addressed the need for infrastructural spending and of the steps it has taken to help ensure credit for viable businesses.  These measures meet Ireland's needs at the present time and the Government will keep them under review.  I commend the Government motion to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">While I welcome the efforts of the Labour Party motion this evening on our economic situation, it is disappointing the party continues to produce solutions that are ill-advised and ill-thought out.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">Our ongoing economic difficulties are the subject of much scrutiny and discussion by economic experts around the world.  Some of them have been critical of our actions and many have been advocates of our actions to date.  Much space in Irish daily newspapers has been taken up with our difficulties and it is difficult for ordinary citizens not to think of themselves as economic experts also.  Economic analysis is being carried on everywhere.  It is time for real debate and a united purpose by all concerned, both inside and outside this House.  It is no longer a time for political point-scoring.  We should all have a common purpose to see this country and indeed the world, out of this economic turmoil.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">There has been much progress over the past 18 months with regard to the state of our banks.  The guarantee scheme was successful, despite the will of the Labour Party.  It it had its way we would now be like Greece but we are not like Greece.  This was demonstrated this week by the Bank of Ireland as no bank in Greece could go to the markets and procure funds.  The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank is still the subject of much debate.  I believe it was the right thing to do.  I agree it has cost our nation a lot of money but I believe it had to be done to stabilise the banking system.  NAMA has come into being in more recent times and it too is the subject of much debate.  I believe it was necessary and is the best solution on offer.  We have seen some extremely tough budgets in the past two years and these were difficult for many people.  We have not taken any joy out of any of these actions.  We were simply faced with intolerable difficulties and based on the best advice available, we shaped solutions.  That is what a Government is elected to do and that is what we will continue to do, even in the face of political point-scoring from across the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">There have been a lot of underhand dealings carried out by a many people in the banking industry.  I do not wish to target everyone in the banking sector but there has been wrongdoing which is difficult to tolerate.  However, these people will face the full rigour of the law in due course and I look forward to that day.  There has been much focus upon the pension payments of bankers and Oireachtas Members.  Such individuals must consider their own situations and whether it is right to be in receipt of these payments in these current times.  I commend those who are doing the right thing by forsaking their pension entitlements.  While no laws are being broken by those in receipt of these payments, we must show unity of purpose.   However, it is absolutely vital that we do not focus our energies on the negativity of our situation, a trap all too easy to fall into.  We must focus ahead to better times, letting the law of the land deal with those who have done wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">Times are difficult for many individuals and families, many of whom I meet in north-east Donegal every week, who are trying to make ends meet, and businesses desperately trying to keep their doors open.  I understand their plight, empathise with them and re-affirm our commitment to bring the country back to economic stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">Public sector workers are currently pondering the Croke Park deal and what it means for them.  I urge them to consider it carefully with an eye to the wider picture.  It is a good deal and one which will provide long-term solutions to some of our current financial difficulties while also delivering on vital reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">On a more positive note, it is not all doom and gloom.  Figures released last week showed exports remain stable while the value of imports increased.  Retail sales have increased by 3% since last year with motor sales increasing by 30% since this time last year thanks to the scrappage scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">While I do not like to quote unemployment figures because these people are real, not just statistics, the ESRI and the Central Bank have predicted unemployment figures will level off over the coming year.  Levelling off may not be something to shout about but we aim to make progress in this regard before the year ends.  We must level off before we can begin to reduce the dole queues.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">The Government has introduced a series of initiatives for job creation and retention, including the employment subsidy scheme, the enterprise stabilisation fund and the PRSI jobs incentive scheme.  Ireland continues to attract foreign direct investment with various jobs announcements in the past several weeks across the country.  The president of Engineers Ireland, Mr. Chris Horn, said last week that the number of multinationals operating in Ireland is jealously viewed by competing jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">Measures have been imposed upon the banks in return for the moneys that have been invested for their rescue and future.  Investing our future in the banks was not a decision taken lightly but out of necessity.  We are beginning to see the return and will continue to do so throughout this year and next whereby ordinary people and businesses will be able to access credit again.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">We must inject some positivity back into society to show the world that Ireland intends to get back to business.  We must do it together.  I look forward to seeing these initiatives being positively productive in returning Ireland to economic growth.</p>

          <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_429">
            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_757">Our banking strategy is working.  Yesterday's announcement that Bank of Ireland would be able to meet its capital requirements through private investment shows the market has confidence in our strategy.  The State will receive a significant return from the transaction with a higher rate of interest on its preference shares which will come to €180 million per annum.  The State will also receive €550 million in cash and hold shares equivalent to 36.5% in the bank, which will return profits in the form of dividends and share sales.  We are in the ultimate phase in the resolution of our banking crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">We cannot, however, get away from the costs involved in resolving the banking crisis.  We have acknowledged the scale of our problems and taken the necessary actions to solve them.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is up and running.  It has determined the price for the first tranche of loans, after rigorous loan-by-loan analysis.  An aggressive approach to the banks loans was taken with the discount averaging about 47%.  NAMA has forced the banks, finally, to acknowledge reality and recognise their losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">In addition, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank have set prudent capital requirements for the banks comprising 8% of core tier 1 capital requirements, of which 7% must be equity.  This is for the benefit of consumers so that banks will never again be able to engage in such reckless lending as in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Banks need additional equity to meet their new capital standards.  Bank of Ireland requires €2.7 billion, which will be raised through private capital and a State commitment to convert part of its preference shares into ordinary equity.  AIB needs €7.4 billion, for which it must submit a detailed capital plan by the end of April.  Due to the massive scale of its losses, Anglo Irish Bank requires capital of €8.7 billion, a figure which may increase.  There is simply no alternative to meeting the bank's unavoidable obligations at a lower cost.  This is necessary to maintain the hard-won stability of the banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">The Financial Regulator has determined that Irish Nationwide Building Society will need an injection of €2.6 billion to remain compliant with its current regulatory capital requirements.  This is a very large bill for the taxpayer but, as in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, it is the least costly solution.  The EBS will need €875 million to meet its capital requirements.  It is exploring the availability of private market capital and has had an expression of interest from a private party.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">At every turn, the Labour Party opposed the bank State guarantee in September 2008.  If its strategy had been adopted then, the banks would have collapsed that night and with it our economy.  The Labour Party has long since advocated a policy of temporary nationalisation for all our banks, an action that is estimated may cost more than €70 billion.  The proposal would have made the taxpayer liable for all of Bank of Ireland's capital and funding requirements, as is the case with Anglo Irish Bank.  We have seen with Anglo Irish Bank that nationalisation is not a panacea for all its ills.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">Our strategy makes private sector capital possible.  The private sector investment in Bank of Ireland is a significant vote of confidence in the bank and the wider economy.  The Government's proposal will lead to an immediate cash return of €550 million and medium and long-term returns, whereas the Labour proposal would require years for a return to the taxpayer as this would only occur when the Bank was sold off through a complex reflotation on the Stock Exchange.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">The burning question for all households and small and medium-sized enterprises is how NAMA will increase credit flow.  NAMA has put the banks in a better position to access funding and provide credit to viable businesses and households because it will increase investor confidence in the banks through the removal of risky assets and will improve liquidity through the exchange of illiquid assets, loans, for more liquid assets, bonds.  We all know the banks have curtailed lending because they are finding it a challenge to get funds.  The providers of funds are reluctant to deposit their money in banks, the quality of whose balance sheets are questionable.  That is why we are recapitalising the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">NAMA will remove this uncertainty, allowing the banks to attract sufficient funding again.  Without NAMA, there would be no credit flow in our economy.  Having set up NAMA to cleanse the banks, the Government is determined to ensure, through the guidelines provided for in the NAMA legislation and through the credit review system, that the banks will begin to perform their proper role in this economy, that of supporting viable and sustainable businesses and households.  That is a role they have not fulfilled since they got carried away with their big dreams and left us all behind.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">The guidelines will set out how credit should flow to sustainable businesses.  I am delighted €2 billion of the €3 billion in funding for Bank of Ireland and AIB will be ring-fenced for SMEs as many banks are not even providing overdraft facilities for many companies.  The successful implementation of NAMA is essential for the renewal of our economy as it will lead to smaller, cleaner and better funded banks that can focus their resources on lending to the real economy and play their part in our economic recovery.  Business cannot flourish in an economy where cash is scarce.  That is why the Government has taken such aggressive steps to fix our banking system.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_769">Deputy Blaney is leaving the Chamber but I agree with him that we must be positive against the background of this economic problem.  That should be the watch call of this Government.  It the reason this debate is so depressing.  Economic recovery in the real economy is what matters now.  It is crucial that we get real businesses back on their feet and employing people again.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">There is a delusion among Ministers on the other side of the House, and on the part of Deputy Mattie McGrath also, that writing whatever cheques are necessary, as the Taoiseach put it, to solve the banking problem and fiscal retrenchment will in some way bring about a recovery in the real economy and that it will get businesses employing people again.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">In his final comment Deputy McGrath expressed some scepticism about whether that is working to date.  He expressed the hope that it will work but I would like to ask a question of him and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Government is setting aside €32 billion for recapitalisation of the banks, 75% of which is going into either Anglo Irish Bank or the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Deputy McGrath must know in his heart, as does every Member in the House, that neither of those banks that are taking 75% of the taxpayers' money will provide any basis for real economic recovery among any business in his constituency or mine.  That is the reality.  There is no point in whistling by the graveyard and pretending the banking strategy is working swimmingly when the Deputy can see, as can Deputy Gilmore and me, that it is not happening on the ground.  That is not happening to business.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The small business association Deputy Penrose quoted is sceptical of Mazars in terms of whether it is picking it up but Mazars is showing that lending to performing businesses has dropped by €7.5 billion, or 25%, since June 2008.  What is growing on the lending front are the loans that are impaired or on the watch list.  They are the only loans that are growing and they have exploded.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">In terms of what is happening, the banks are perforce nursing small business loans that are non-performing but they are squeezing the life out of businesses that have a chance of surviving.  That is what is happening on the ground and Mazars, for all the weakness in its analysis, is telling us that.  It puts this debate into context.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The truth, as Mazars tell us, is that performing businesses or businesses with a chance of surviving this recession and building a trading economy on which we can hope to hold on to our young people are being squeezed.  A bank using State capital to provide lending to those small businesses is crucial.  We are not two or three months after the banking crisis.  It is now 18 months since the crisis burst upon us.  Deputy McGrath had to come into the House with the script that was provided for him and tell us that some measure for small business is around the corner and that if we wait a little longer we will see the magnificent fruits.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, read into the record all the commitments that have been extracted from AIB and Bank of Ireland but a check of the record reveals that in February 2009, more than 12 months ago, he said the same commitments had been exacted from the banks.  The comments are virtually identical, even down to the reference to Enterprise Ireland, to which Deputy Morgan, who has left the Chamber, referred.  Enterprise Ireland was to be in the thick of the great break-through but it did not happen and at some point the penny has to drop that it might not happen.  Instead of pouring 75% or €25,000 million of scarce taxpayers' money into Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society perhaps we should assign €2 billion, as Deputy Gilmore and Fine Gael have suggested, to develop a bank that can lend directly to the very businesses that have a chance of recovery and get money to bankable business projects.  That is the challenge facing us.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">Writing these cheques to keep Anglo Irish Bank on the go as part of a grand plan that will get us out of this mess is a question we must put under scrutiny.  People like Deputy McGrath, who are critical at times of the adequacy of Government policy, need to put it under scrutiny.  They should show me how this will work.  They should explain how the cost of refloating Anglo Irish Bank or keeping it as a going concern rose from €4 billion to €6 billion to €10 billion to €18 billion and now to €22 billion and rising — we do not yet know the final figure — and the reason Government policy continues to be that the bank must be kept open.  Does the cost that has escalated nearly six-fold since the policy was first enunciated not suggest, as normal cost benefit would suggest, that this policy might not be such a good one after all?  Those are questions we need to be asking and the onus is on Ministers to come up with the answers.  They should provide us with the evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">We got evidence from Anglo Irish Bank that was supposed to convince us.  That was based on its analysis of the performance of its loans, and it said it was cheaper to keep the bank going but within weeks of it producing that analysis to the effect that its loans are worth 70% of their book value, we suddenly discovered that NAMA, which was appointed by the State to put a value on them, disagreed.  It had written them down not at 70% but 52% and there are questions about the adequacy of that to accurately reflect the entire Anglo book.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">The body that seemed to be providing the Government with the ammunition to back up its position, Anglo Irish Bank, suddenly had the carpet pulled out from under it.  It was the one that had access to those loans.  It had been nursing them for years.  It should have known them better than anyone but it took NAMA to tell us the reality.  Where is the independent Government analysis of the soundness of the strategy of keeping Anglo Irish Bank as a going concern?</p>
            <p eId="para_779">We are facing a real problem.  The private sector is stretched.  It has huge debt burdens.  It will not lift itself by its own boot-straps if the Government concentrates on fiscal retrenchment and writing cheques for the banks, particularly banks that will never lend another euro.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">As Deputy Blaney said, the Government must now consider what this country needs to get us out of the position in which we find ourselves.  Surely what it needs is some measure that gets money flowing to bankable businesses and that invests in arteries for the long-term economic future, namely, our broadband, electricity and water systems and our alternative energy sources.  It must also examine how we can reform public service to ensure we can protect the front line as we inevitably must make do with less coming from a strained economy.  Those are the challenges on which Government should be focusing, and we should be seeing strategies for those challenges.  Ministers who come in here and say they are still spending on some of those programmes while not admitting that they are reduced by 40% from what they were supposed to be are codding us and codding the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">We must be clever and imaginative about how we devise ways of driving those investments.  I believe the national recovery bank or Deputy Gilmore's alternative strategic bank, is a contribution to that debate.  Fine Gael's NewERA, which is about raising much of the money that has been saved furiously by people in the private sector and converting that into investment in infrastructures that will get us out of the current position, is another positive contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">This is a debate about the new versus the old and the future versus the past.  The easy approach is to nurse the bad lending of the past, close down opportunities for young people, stop recruiting to the public service and retrench by slashing the investment programmes.  That is the thinking of the past but it will not build a future that will employ the people we need to employ, namely, the young people coming out of our colleges.  They are emigrating in droves and we will lose the basis of an economic recovery in this country if that continues to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">I appeal to the Government to get its head out of the sand and start to debate the choices to get this country moving again.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_433">
            <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
            <p eId="para_784">I am delighted to contribute to this debate tonight.  Everyone agrees there is a problem with credit flow in the SME sector.  In July 2008, I asked that the chief executive officers of the main banks, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Anglo Irish Bank be called to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, one of whom, Mr. Richie Boucher, is now chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland, to discuss the flow of credit to the SME sector.  At that time the CEOs stated there was no problem in terms of the provision of credit.  This should have been a warning sign that the banking sector was under enormous pressure.  A little less than three months later the bank guarantee scheme in respect of the covered institutions was introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">We must now consider what is being proposed by Government and the Opposition parties.  The Government is effectively proposing to put €25 billion into the banks and €43 billion into NAMA, which amounts to €68 billion of taxpayers' money.  The question that arises is whether this will get credit flowing to the SME sector.  I recall, when the Government guarantee scheme was being put in place on the night of 29 September, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stating this was about ensuring credit would flow to the real economy.  Almost 18 months later this has not happened.  The Government is hoping that NAMA will free up liquidity and deal with solvency in the banks.  While it will deal with solvency, we do not know for how long because many loans are not being taken over by NAMA.  It should free up liquidity.  Former chief executive officer of Allied Irish Bank, Mr. Eugene Sheehy, is on record as stating before an Oireachtas committee in response to Deputy Burton and me that AIB could not give a guarantee it would be using the NAMA bonds to access credit.  We are now putting approximately €25 billion into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, two institutions that will never lend.  As Deputy Bruton asked earlier: "Is this good use of taxpayers' money?"</p>
            <p eId="para_786">The question that must be asked is: "Is what the Government is doing good for the economy and the SME sector?"  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, stated in regard to Bank of Ireland yesterday that it was good for the economy, the taxpayer and the shareholders.  However, is putting €25 billion into two dead banks, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, good for the SME sector, the economy and the taxpayer?  The answer in both cases is "No."  What we need is a proper strategy in terms of getting credit flowing to the small business sector.  Labour Party and Fine Gael Party policy seek to achieve the same result.  Fine Gael's policy is the establishment of a national recovery bank which will effectively provide State equity of €2 billion thus allowing that bank to access credit from the European Central Bank and providing much needed liquidity to the SME sector through the vehicles of the existing banks.  This would be a proper barometer and a proper risk-sharing mechanism.  It would allow us to go to the banks to buy good loans and a risk-sharing mechanism could be put in place to ensure lending takes place.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">The chief executive officer of ISME, Mr. Mark Fielding, appeared before the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs today.  The Mazars report has been much quoted by the Irish Banking Federation.  The Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment appear to have had no involvement in this report which was launched by the Irish Banking Federation and Mazars.  The limitations in that report are astounding.  Institutions of the sophistication of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland can give no breakdown of new and existing lending or between small and big business.  I do not believe they cannot do that.  Despite these limitations, the Mazars report states that lending to the SME sector is decreasing consistently.  The Central Bank monthly statistics show that in the 12 months to end February there was a €12 billion decrease in private sector credit from the institutions.  This is the same amount the Irish Government has invested, by way of €3.5 billion direct State investment in Bank of Ireland and €8 billion to €9 billion in NAMA through the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">The question that must be asked is, "Is Government policy working?"  The answer, in respect of credit flow, is that it is not.  The answer in regard to whether it is working in terms of the banks' insolvency is, "Yes, at the moment it is."  The answer in regard to whether it is working in terms of getting the banks to lend is, "No."  The banks will continue to shrink their balance sheets.  They are responsible to their shareholders.  The Government has committed €12 billion to Bank of Ireland.  As regards the plan in terms of getting credit flowing to the SME sector, in respect of the €3 million to the two main banks, we will not know the result of this particular exercise until 14 May.  Furthermore, the credit oversight review process will take time.  Businesses need cash.  Without cashflow businesses cannot survive.  We have a banking crisis and we need a mechanism to get credit flowing to the SME sector.  Businesses are going out of operation not because they are not profitable but because they do not have cash.  There is an old saying in business that cash is king.  If a business does not have access to credit it cannot survive.  The Government has committed to paying the SME sector within 30 days.  However, many Departments are not honouring that commitment which in turn is putting enormous pressure on the SME sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">The second strand of the Labour Party motion, in terms of providing credit, is investment in strategic infrastructure.  Fine Gael has put forward an alternative proposal through NewEra, which effectively amounts to accessing resources of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, a national recovery bond, funding from the European Investment Bank, commercial lending by the State institutions to ensure we have vital and necessary infrastructure in energy, telecommunications and water.  We need to ensure our broadband penetration is among the top five countries of the OECD by 2013.  Currently, we are the second worst among the EU 15.  In regard to water, we are, outside of capital expenditure, spending €700 million per annum producing clean water.  Some 43% of drinking water is lost through leakage.  We need a strategic approach in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">The Government has lost sight of the fact that credit flow equals jobs equals survival of business, which is a simple formula.  The Government proposes to invest €3 million in the two main banks.  It must also put in place a proper job strategy that ensures an avenue for lending to businesses that are struggling and need funding.  My concern, in terms of the Mazars report, is that the figures provided by the banks relate in the main to rolled up interest.  They are squeezing existing businesses to get repayments and allowing rolled up interest, which gives the impression they are providing credit.  It is window dressing.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">What is the Government going to do to ensure credit flow?  The Labour Party proposal is a valid one.  Fine Gael has put forward an alternative approach, namely, a national recovery bank, which seeks to achieve the same purpose.  The Labour Party has proposed the establishment of a strategic investment bank.  What will the Government do to ensure a proper jobs strategy?  Mr. Mark Fielding, head of ISME, stated today that the Government has no such business proposal.  What is required is a proper jobs business proposal to ensure the SME sector can get credit into viable businesses and to provide necessary infrastructure.  The role of Government is to provide a way to allow enterprise to prosper.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_792">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in this urgent debate on the jobs crisis on the northside of Dublin.  I raise this issue on behalf of the people of Coolock, Edenmore, Whitehall, Marino, Fairview, Beaumont, Artane, Raheny, Killester and Clontarf.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">There are now 400,000 people unemployed, thousands of whom live on the northside of Dublin.  I stand up for them tonight to put their case to the Minister.  In recent weeks, there have been great debates about banking and pensions.  Tonight, I put the question: "Who is talking about the unemployed and those losing their jobs?"  This is why we need a jobs strategy now.  We also need new and radical ideas to develop that strategy.  I accept that €30 million was made available in support of companies on the northside of Dublin, especially in my area of Dublin North-Central, and I was part of pushing that agenda.  However, we must do a great deal more.  We need new ideas and this is why I warmly welcome the <i>www.thinkirish.ie</i> campaign to create 20,000 new jobs.  This campaign is excellent.  It is a new consumer campaign and a crusade which is going from strength to strength.  I call on everyone in the Oireachtas to lend their support to help make it stronger.  The <i>thinkirish.ie</i> initiative is a not-for-profit, grassroots initiative that encourages Irish households to switch €20 of their weekly household spend to Irish-made goods and services in an effort to create 20,000 new jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The organisation was not established by corporate Ireland or any industry or interest group, but by a group of concerned citizens who wish to see the economy back on track.  It is an example of real people-power at work and it is beginning to gain traction with ordinary people the length and breadth of the country.  Ultimately, we wish to see stronger indigenous industry generate more jobs and take people off the dole queues.  Success in the domestic market is critical for all these companies if they are to expand and take on the risks associated with entering export markets.  Their success is intrinsically linked to the support they receive from Irish consumers.  This is why I wish to stimulate and prompt debate on the issue and tonight's debate is part of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">A key part of the campaign is the recent launch of Ireland's first and only comprehensive on-line directory of Irish-made and Irish-grown products.  Consumers may access independent information on goods with a genuine Irish provenance.  While recognising that official Government aid for the campaign may be difficult to reconcile with EU competition law, I believe we are uniquely placed to assist in generating additional momentum behind the campaign.  I raise the issue because I believe it is very important that all Members get behind the campaign and I call on everyone to support those involved and to make people aware of it.  Perhaps politicians could include details of the campaign in their local newsletter or e-mail details to constituents.  We should also encourage local producers and manufacturers to list their businesses in the directory.  Product listings are provided free of charge and offer a superb promotional opportunity for local businesses.  I urge Members to champion the cause with people they believe may help with their campaign in whatever capacity is appropriate.  This is a bootstrap initiative with a great need for additional resources.  Everyone involved in the campaign would welcome assistance, especially by the Minister, in the campaign to create more jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">I urge the Minister to support sensible plans to create jobs on the northside of Dublin.  I urge all politicians to stop bickering over small things and to focus on employment.  If we wish to get out of this economic mess, we need jobs and investment to assist in dealing with the national debt.  Management means doing things right.  Leadership means doing the right things.  I urge the Minister to act now on the jobs crisis on the northside of Dublin.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dick Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_797">I am very pleased to reply to this debate because I understand the sincerity with which Deputy McGrath addresses this issue.  I also know something of the crisis in this area because, as Deputy McGrath will recall, I took some personal criticism when I designated Ballymun as the place to receive 500 jobs from IKEA some years ago.  As usual, the prophets of doom suggested the country would grind to a halt.  However, local people are working there now.  I commend Deputy McGrath for his personal contribution to that fight and to other fights on behalf of constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The Deputy will be aware that the live register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  It collects data from a wide range of sources.  In the past year the live register has increased by 18% in north Dublin, in line with the overall increase for County Dublin, which is quite shocking at 19%, a point seldom adverted to in debates.  The highest annual increases in the local social welfare offices were recorded in the Navan Road, Finglas and Coolock offices, areas to which the Deputy referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">For the purpose of promoting investment and jobs in Dublin, the enterprise development agencies do not distinguish between individual postal districts.  According to the latest figures available, there were 1,957 Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Dublin city, employing 5,036 people.  In 2009 and to date in 2010, almost €37 million has been paid out to Enterprise Ireland client companies in the Dublin city area.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">In terms of foreign direct investment, Dublin has been something of a success story with a critical mass of population, a skills pool, educational infrastructure, international access connections, existing business activity across all sectors and extensive property solutions for future activity.  The latest figures show that in 2009, some 482 IDA-supported companies employ 47,726 people.  Deputy McGrath might make the point, and if he did I would probably agree with him, that one of the things he is talking about is people with lesser skills and the need to look after such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Traditionally, Dublin has been a centre for manufacturing industry for foreign direct investment but in recent years there has been a shift away from manufacturing, due to cost competitiveness, to more knowledge-based, value-added projects in fund management, e-commerce, software and so on.  Recent job announcements in the north Dublin area include the establishment of IBM's first smarter cities technology centre, which is expected to create 200 new jobs and an announcement by eBay in March that it expects to create 150 new jobs at its European centre of excellence in Blanchardstown.  Deputy McGrath laid a specific emphasis on the need to create a local focus, a point on which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The northside of Dublin is also served by the Dublin City Enterprise Board and the Fingal County Enterprise Board.  As part of the 35 city enterprise board network, these boards have an excellent track record in tapping into local entrepreneurial potential.  Increasingly, their focus has been on the development of sustainable growth-orientated local enterprise which can deliver high quality job creation without displacement or deadweight.  The current parameters within which the enterprise boards operate enable them to deliver valuable assistance to business start-ups with good growth and employment potential.  Through the provision of financial and non-financial support, the boards have assisted many micro-enterprises to develop their growth and export potential as well as bringing them to a stage at which they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.  More than 30,726 jobs were created in community enterprise boards between 1993 to end 2009.  Within these totals to date, Dublin City Enterprise Board and Fingal Enterprise Board have assisted the micro-enterprise sector with the creation of 2,923 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Through its network of training centres and its services to business unit, FÁS works closely with the enterprise boards.  It is providing many support services in north Dublin.  In particular, FÁS employment services, Dublin north, has responded to collective redundancies in many organisations, including SR Technics, Cadbury Ireland and IBM.  In the case of SR Technics, FÁS employment services interviewed in excess of 800 staff on-site.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Government submitted a provisional application to the European Commission in October 2009 for co-financing support from the European globalisation fund towards the cost of a personalised package of retraining, upskilling, entrepreneurial supports and educational opportunities for the workers made redundant from SR Technics.  I assure the Deputy that the State agencies promote Dublin as an attractive location for employment and investment opportunities and continue to make their full range of employment, training and guidance services available.  I will conclude by adding to a point that was well made by Deputy McGrath.  If Deputies in the Dublin area, in particular, were to focus in their newsletters on initiatives like those he mentioned, nothing but good would come from it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_805">This debate has been prompted by the resignation of the Governor of the Dóchas Centre, Ms Kathleen McMahon, to whom I pay tribute.  I commend her work during her time at the Dóchas Centre.  The matter of the resignation should, at long last, cause the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in particular, to come forward with a prison plan.  The resignation of Governor McMahon is the latest in a long line of totally unacceptable occurrences in the prison system.  Each year, we receive the reports of the Inspector of Prisons, the prison visiting committees around the country and the various prison chaplains.  We also receive numerous other national and international reports from bodies like the Council of Europe and Amnesty International.  Such reports consistently cite the serious problems that go to the root of our prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">If something good is to come from the resignation of Governor McMahon, I hope it is that the Government produces a plan.  It does not have one at present.  Problems like chronic overcrowding, drugs in prison and the revolving door system are discussed in this House on a regular basis.  Last week, a man who was given a ten-month prison sentence in a court in Limerick served just two days in prison.  We often hear that our prisons are dangerous, unsafe and characterised by the revolving door.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The last major initiative we had on prisons was as far back as 1985, when the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, instructed Mr. T. K. Whitaker to engage in a comprehensive process that ultimately resulted in the production of the Whitaker report.  Many years on, it is sad that many of the recommendations in the report have yet to be implemented.  In a document written more than 20 years after the publication of the report, the chairman of the committee reflected on the prison system then and now:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_808">The Committee saw in imprisonment little beyond temporary — and very expensive — protection of the public, with virtually no rehabilitative or educational value.  Far too many people were — and still are — imprisoned for short periods of time for minor offences not involving violence, such as debt, resulting in overcrowding and unwarranted expense.  For such crimes, we recommended other penalties.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Those who reflected on 1985 indicated that very little had changed and nothing had improved.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">As Governor McMahon made clear, we have an intolerable situation in our prisons.  There are reports of bullying and harassment of staff.  Prisoners and staff members are endangered.  This situation must change.  I ask the Minister to implement a programme of real reform in our prison system.  He should commit himself and his colleagues to implementing the recommendations made in reports on prison inspections within a specific timeframe.  Full body scanners should be introduced to screen visitors and prevent mobile phones and other contraband, including drugs, from being smuggled in.  Attachment of earnings orders, which were proposed in this House by Fine Gael some years ago, should be introduced.  Community service should be used as a sanction for minor offences.  The Thornton Hall project, which is suffering from inaction on the part of the Minister, should be reviewed.  We have spent over €40 million on the project, but not one brick or block has been laid on the north Dublin site to date.</p>

We should ensure that the probation services are properly co-ordinated so they can engage in post-prison monitoring.  The integrated sentence management system should be introduced in every prison.  I hope the resignation of Ms McMahon will spur the Minister into some form of action.  If he cannot keep our prisons safe, how can he be expected to keep our streets safe?</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_814">I wish to begin with the facts.  The Governor of the Dóchas Centre, Kathleen McMahon, notified the director general of the Prison Service on 31 March last of her intention to retire from the Irish Prison Service on 21 May next.  Having served over 30 years in the Prison Service, she is entitled to retire on full pension.  Ms McMahon has rightly been given credit for the enormous contribution she made to the development of the Dóchas Centre since it opened in 1999.  While it is true that Governor McMahon raised a number of issues with the director general in the context of her retirement, he has expressed his disappointment that she did not discuss such matters with him before she notified him of her intention to retire.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">As I have informed the Deputy and the House on numerous occasions, there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This is due primarily to the additional resources provided by the Government to the Garda Síochána, which has resulted in increased numbers of successful prosecutions.  In addition, extra court sittings have led to more committals.  I can put the increased Garda and court activity in context by mentioning that there are 1,000 more criminals in our prisons than there were in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">There is no easy or quick answer to the issue of overcrowding in the prison system.  The Prison Service must accept all committals made by the courts.  It cannot opt out.  The problem of overcrowding is not unique to this country — it is an international one.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">I have examined prisoner numbers over recent times.  It may benefit the Deputy and the House if I give some sample figures.  On 6 February 1997, when Deputy Flanagan's party was in Government and the prisons were starved of resources because not one prison cell was being built, there were 2,334 people in custody.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">If we move forward a decade to 6 February 2007, we find that there were 3,262 people in custody.  Yesterday, there were 4,197 people in custody.  It behoves all of us in this House to speak on the basis of an understanding of the pressure on the Prison Service to deal with this increase in numbers.</p>

            <p eId="para_822">We have responded to the increase in the prisoner population by providing for a significant increase in prison places.  I have given the figures to the Deputy on numerous occasions in the past.  It bears repeating that over 1,720 new prison spaces have been provided since 1997.  A further 200 spaces are being provided in the short term through a current project — a new block that is ready to open in Wheatfield Prison.  Work is expected to start in the latter half of this year on a new 300-space block in the Midlands Prison complex in Portlaoise.  In the longer term, a new purpose-built prison campus at Thornton Hall will provide approximately 1,400 cells on a 130-acre site.  This will allow us to replace the antiquated Mountjoy Prison campus with modern, purpose-built and regime-focused accommodation.  The new facility will have the operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">The Thornton Hall project is progressing on a phased basis with the full support of my Government colleagues.  One aspect of the project involves the replacement of the Dóchas Centre with a new women's prison, with accommodation for 170 women.  This will bring the best elements of the experience of the Dóchas regime to the new facility.  Similarly, women prisoners will be catered for at the new Munster prison, which is planned for Kilworth, with facilities that best meet the particular needs of female offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">It is sometimes suggested that we are sending people to prison who should not be there.  I do not hold that view.  The Judiciary, which is independent in its functions, decides on the most appropriate punishment to fit the crime.  It and it alone holds this function.  The prisons, as I have said already, must accept all committals.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">Deputies on all sides of the House recognise and will accept that we have some very serious criminals in our prison system serving longer sentences for very serious and heinous crimes.  In fact, over 80% of convicted prisoners in custody at any one time are in prison for relatively serious offences and are serving sentences of more than 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Turning more specifically to women prisoners in custody, it may interest the Deputy to know that, of the 117 women in custody yesterday serving sentences, 25% of that cohort of female sentenced prisoners were serving a sentence for murder, manslaughter or conspiracy to murder.  A further 21% were serving sentences for possession of drugs for the purpose of sale or supply.  Some 28% were serving sentences for offences such as robbery, theft and criminal damage, and of this 28% only four prisoners were serving sentences of less than 12 months.  Those figures speak very loudly.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">Side by side with enhancing our prison system by the provision of appropriate accommodation and educational and other opportunities we must, of course, also examine how other non-custodial options might be used.  I hope the Fines Bill will have a positive effect.  Likewise, the expansion of community service orders will, over time, it is hoped, make a difference.  I am open to considering new ways of dealing with offending behaviours mindful of the overwhelming need to do so in the context of public protection and community safety.  As Minister I am committed to supporting the Irish Prison Service in its daily work to manage the prisoner population in the knowledge that increasing numbers do place pressures on the system and day-to-day operational decisions must be taken as to how best to manage the prisoner population by the director general and his senior management team.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_447">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_828">I thank the Minister for addressing this Adjournment matter.  We are at something of a crossroads at the current time regarding the work plan for the European Union over the next ten years.  We have had the Lisbon strategy from 2000 to 2010 and we are about to embark on the 2020 strategy from 2010 to 2020.  It is in that context that I make my request here tonight that the Irish Government take the initiative and support the proposal by the European Commission for the setting of a European Union target of a reduction of 25% in poverty in the European Union at the next meeting of the European Council.  This is a most appropriate year in which to set that target because it is the European year of combatting poverty and social exclusion and it is the beginning of a new decade of planning for the future in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The strategy is currently being finalised by the European Commission and it is likely that the votes will be taken in June by the European Council on behalf of the member states on whether it will accept a target regarding poverty.  As the Minister knows, many of the non-governmental organisations are supporting the European Commission on this matter.  It seems to me that there is not much sense in having a general wish that poverty be reduced unless one actually establishes a target and seeks to reach it.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">A target of 25% over ten years is not unattainable, rather, it is realistic.  It is a reduction of only 2.5% per annum in poverty in the European Union.  When one examines the figures and finds that 79 to 80 million people in the European Union are living in poverty or are at risk of poverty and 90 million children are also affected, it gives a fairly stark picture of the situation within the European Union.  There are 300,000 people in Ireland in consistent poverty and 18% of our child population is at risk of poverty.  We have every reason to have a strong, targeted policy in the European Union on the reduction of poverty and the promotion of social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">It would be great if by 2020 we could say that the target of taking 20 million European citizens out of poverty had been achieved.  Unless we establish the target there is no way it will be achieved.  It must be a set target.  Set strategies must be put in place to deal with it.  We in Ireland established the Combat Poverty Agency, even though the Government abolished it last year.  It was established by Frank Cluskey of the Labour Party in 1975.  It was transported to Europe and has been part and parcel of the European approach to dealing with poverty ever since.  Frank Cluskey stated that inequality and poverty are linked, and that inequality leads to poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">We have a good track record in dealing with poverty in this country.  Believe it or not, there was a substantial reduction in poverty during the Celtic tiger years.  We made achievements, which we recognise, but one cannot achieve anything without setting targets.  This is something which we can do and on which we can take the lead, but we must make a decision almost immediately because if we do not make a decision, make sure it is on the table and get the other members to agree to it by the time of the European Council meeting in June, it is likely it will not be done at all.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_448" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_833">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  We had an opportunity to discuss it very briefly during the meeting last week of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I agree with the Deputy that targets are important but they have to be precise and not waffle; they have to be very specific.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">The spring European Council reached agreement on the main elements of the new European strategy for jobs and growth, known as Europe 2020, which includes key targets which will guide its implementation and arrangements for its improved monitoring.  The European Council also agreed that the new strategy will have a sharp focus on the key areas where action is required, namely, knowledge and innovation, a more sustainable economy, high employment and social inclusion.  These areas are very much in line with our own national strategies <i>, </i>building Ireland’s smart economy and the national action plan for social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">The Council further agreed on the five headline targets which are to be covered.  They are employment; research and development, including innovation; climate change and energy; education; and social inclusion, in particular poverty.  These targets cover the main areas where efforts are rapidly needed and they are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.  It is intended that the targets will help in measuring progress achieved in implementing the new strategy.  An overall governance structure and monitoring mechanisms were also agreed by last month's European Council.  These will place the European Council at the centre of the monitoring progress towards the successful implementation of the strategy over the coming decade.  The Deputy will agree with me that there is no better equipped body to do that than that which comprises heads of state and Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">In the case of the education and social inclusion targets, further work needs to be done to reach numerical rates and appropriate indicators.  These are important targets and it is essential that we get the rates and indicators right, in order that they are relevant and appropriate right across the entire Union.  The European Council will return to elaborate upon these targets at its June meeting, which has already been agreed.  The inclusion by the European Council of the headline targets on education and social inclusion, in particular poverty, is a reflection of the extreme seriousness and centrality of these issues to this new strategy.  It is only because the European Council recognises that these are areas where efforts are rapidly needed that they have been included in this very select group of just five European Union level targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">I referred to this during the course of the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week.  The previous programme had become like a Christmas tree, with everybody adding his or her favourite bauble.  The reality is that if one does not have precision and focus one does not get results, which is why the European Council is correct to pick five key targets.  Deputy Costello suggested targets are important but they must, as I said at the outset, be precise.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">Let me emphasise that it is not a question of Ireland, or any other country, wishing to exclude a focus on the poverty issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">It is explicitly included but deliberations are needed among the 27 member states and with the Commission on the necessary methods to be employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">In common with many other EU partners, we had certain concerns about the initial Commission proposal for the sole use of an "at risk of poverty" target when measuring social cohesion.  Nationally, we use a composite measure of consistent poverty, which includes the "at risk of poverty" measure, as well as a measure of basic deprivation.  The consistent poverty measure provides a more comprehensive picture of the true levels of poverty.  We will work intensively over the period ahead with EU partners and the Commission to arrive at a broadly agreeable indicator in this area.  We have every expectation that this will be achievable before the European Council will return to elaborate upon these targets at its June meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">Prior to the meeting considerable work must be undertaken on various aspects of the strategy, including work related to the EU headline targets on education and social inclusion, in particular, poverty; the development of national targets by each member state in dialogue with the Commission; the identification of bottlenecks constraining growth at national and EU level; the development by the Commission of its proposals for action at EU level, notably through the flagship initiatives; and the development of more focused integrated guidelines, including the broad economic policy guidelines and employment guidelines, which it is envisaged will provide the framework for the strategy at member state level.  Proposals for these guidelines were adopted by the Commission in Brussels earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">Our national process of follow-up to the conclusions of the spring European Council on this new strategy is under way through a process of interdepartmental consultation.  An initial meeting with the European Commission and Spanish Presidency has been scheduled for 29 April.  The purpose of this initial meeting will be to begin the process of dialogue with the Commission concerning Ireland's national targets, as envisaged under the new strategy.  This will need to happen quite quickly, given the relatively tight timelines agreed and set out by the spring European Council for this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">In advance of the June Council meeting, when it is intended the strategy, including its five headline targets, will be formally adopted, a wide range of actions will take place both at national and EU levels, ranging from various meetings of EU expert groups and working groups to a series of meetings of the Council in its various formations, including <i> inter alia</i> the General Affairs and Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Councils meetings.  Ireland will continue to be actively engaged with the elaboration of this new EU strategy for jobs and growth in all these fora.  It can provide a useful impulse at EU level to the efforts of member states, including Ireland, to secure a recovery based on inclusive growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">I assured the Deputy last week that there is no wish whatsoever to water down this process in any member state but given that we have isolated five areas, there is a wish that the targets be precise and not simply waffle because that is the way we will make the progress we all want.</p>

          <speech by="#PJSheenan" eId="spk_449">
            <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
            <p eId="para_845">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the important issue of a restriction on the amount of sea lettuce that can be removed from the beaches at Inchydoney and Courtmacsherry and the coastline of Clonakilty Bay and Courtmacsherry Bay in south west Cork, which have been blighted by huge swathes of rotting and noxious smelling green tide with its foul odour being detectable up to 4 km inland.  There is a proposal by a commercial operator to use the dried ulva as an ingredient for animal and fish feed by operating a €1.5 million drying and processing facility in south west Cork, which would create local employment and remove this dangerous scourge from the beaches and coves of these two bays.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">I understand that a progress report has been completed by the local task force and this has been submitted to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for consideration.  I have been invited to a briefing on the report on Friday week by Cork County Council.  I have raised this issue because that it has been reported that a limit of 50 tonnes has been proposed in this report on the amount that can be removed by commercial operations for use, while it has been scientifically calculated that up to 200,000 tonnes is washed ashore annually in south west Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">Sea lettuce has been an ongoing problem since first recorded in 1995.  One reporter described it as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_848">The other morning the vast lawns of sea lettuces looked beautiful in the sunlight, like dark green golf courses or the Serengeti after the first annual rain. However, when it dries over the cord grass it appears like stretched grey skin with ribs protruding from beneath. The Serengeti suddenly seems to be ringed with corpses of dead elephants.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Last August, unprecedented amounts of this algae sea lettuce washed up on the beaches of Brittany, France, causing a major public health scare as it decomposed.  The rotting leaves produced large quantities of hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas.  In one incident a horse rider lost consciousness and his horse died after breathing the seaweed fumes.  In another incident, a lorry driver passed out, crashed and died, with toxic fumes claimed to be the cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">Sea lettuce is not only an environmental nuisance, but is potentially lethal.  I do not want reports going right around the world of tourists deaths in my constituency, Cork South West, because a bureaucratic committee decided to pussy foot around the issue.  The cause of this problem has been identified in a report commissioned by the EPA and sitting gathering dust in its offices since March 2007 as nutrient enrichment provided by sewage and animal waste.  The operator behind the proposed industrial development is considering an alternative site in Brittany, France, to base his operations if he is not allowed to commence operations here as he needs the go ahead soon to commence operations for this year.  We cannot afford to lose these jobs, which are badly needed in this area.  The operator and his company would do us a favour by removing the sea lettuce before it stinks to the high heavens.  By removing the sea lettuce they will save Cork County Council hundreds of thousands of euro in clean-up operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">I call on the Minister to publish the EPA report immediately in order that the remedies can be tackled, including the installation of sewage treatment facilities.  I doubt he will have the resources during the rest of his term of office of two years and one week from today, provided the Government goes the full term, and, therefore, I ask him not to put a limit on the amount of sea lettuce that can be removed for commercial purposes rather than sitting on his hands and letting this problem rot for another 15 years.  I want to go home to my people in west Cork at the end of this week and say the Minister has taken a small step in the right direction.  His remaining time in office is short and, therefore, the time for action is now.  He should publish the EPA report, licence the removal of the sea lettuce and pursue the commissioning of sewage treatment plants in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_852">That was a spirited performance as ever from the Deputy.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I were raised within sight, sound and smell of the Safe in Wexford.  We are fully familiar with the problem of sea lettuce.  The Deputy waxed eloquently about how it looks when the tide is coming in in the early morning but anybody who has been in the vicinity of a large amount of sea lettuce when the tide is out will recognise the Deputy's description of its noxious nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Accumulations of sea lettuce have become an increasing nuisance and this is recognised by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Sea lettuce is a naturally occurring seaweed that can multiply and reach very high volumes where conditions are favourable.  Large deposits on beaches are unsightly and where allowed to decay can present a potential health hazard.  Fishing interests too have reported their equipment becoming fouled by the seaweed while it is still waterborne.  In recent years, Cork County Council has removed sea lettuce from the affected beaches but the problem in 2009 grew to such an extent that a more sustainable approach was required.  Some 10,000 tonnes of sea lettuce was washed up on the beaches in the vicinity of Clonakilty Bay.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who up to January of this year had responsibility for all foreshore matters, recognised the impact that this phenomenon was having on locals and tourists in west Cork and established a task force to examine this problem in October 2009.  The taskforce was asked to advise on the scientific, engineering, public safety and policy aspects relevant to the management and control of the sea lettuce problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">As the Deputy indicated, the taskforce was made up of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Cork County Council and the Health Service Executive, under the chairmanship of Dr. Terry McMahon of the Marine Institute.  I understand that the taskforce has now completed its work and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, expects to receive its report shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">The Deputy has raised the question of whether a limit has been placed on the amount of sea lettuce that can be removed from the beaches for the purposes of processing into fish feed.  I can advise him that no such limit has been imposed — by either the Department or the local authority.  I also understand that the taskforce report will not make any recommendations relating to limiting the removal of sea lettuce.  Deputy Sheehan can go home happy this week.  A person who swims every day knows the problem of sea lettuce.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">It is not in my office.  However, I accept the undertaking is important to Deputy Sheehan and his constituents.  It is important to remember that the priority must be the safeguarding of the beaches and those who use them in the summer.  These beaches, including Inchydoney blue flag beach, are key to west Cork tourism and must be protected.  I understand that water conditions may soon again be favourable for growth of the lettuce and the removal of the material from the beaches must be undertaken promptly.  While the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is concerned that any possible solutions to the disposal of the material will fully exploit the potential for reuse or recycling of the sea lettuce, I am sure the Deputy will agree that the early removal of the material is of prime importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">As regards the plan to tackle the problem this summer, I am advised that Cork County Council intends to be in full readiness for the clean-up and disposal operation when it is required.  The council has already sought expressions of interest from commercial interests on the most efficient means of disposal of the sea lettuce.  As Deputy Sheehan heads back down to that beautiful part of this country the news is probably more positive than it was when he started speaking tonight.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_862">I have not changed my philosophy or my approach to the roll out of a national postcode system in Ireland.  I continue to believe a smart economy requires that the underlying infrastructure supports enterprises based on knowledge and innovation.  For this, an ability to collate and assess data spatially is a prerequisite.  This is where postcodes play a key role and where they can deliver economic and social benefits across the whole economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">As the Deputy is aware, the Government has approved the implementation of a postcode system as recommended by the National Postcode Project Board.  This Board, which comprised representatives from Government Departments, together with public and private sector organisations, was established to recommend the most technically appropriate postcode system for Ireland, design an implementation plan and assess the costs and benefits of postcodes.  In the course of its deliberations, the Board looked at a number of postcode models and technologies including postal sector models and a number of spatial and hybrid postcode models taking into account a number of factors including memorability, likely uptake by the public and ability to adapt to emerging technologies.  The model recommended, and since approved by Government, is an alpha-numeric, publicly available and accessible postal sector model.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">Each postcode will have a geo-coordinate at its centre and consequently, would be compatible with global positioning or navigation systems, allowing integration with GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite technologies.  Indeed, applications based on such systems, become much more readily accessible to the public through the use of a postcode.  My officials and I are currently working to implement this project.  That delivery will be effected by way of a competitive tender process.  A competition will be re-tendered shortly to select a body that will assist the Department in managing the delivery of a working postcodes system.  Because of the need to re-tender I envisage some slippage in the originally targeted date for introduction of a postcode system.  However, I still expect to have rolled out a national postcodes system in 2011.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_866">There were three new discoveries of oil and gas in the Irish Offshore in recent years; however none of these have been declared commercial to date.  During 2007 two finds were made in the North Celtic Sea Basin off the South Coast. Providence Resources Limited identified an oil accumulation at the Hook Head prospect while Island Oil and Gas Limited encountered gas at the Scull prospect.  During 2009 Serica Energy PLC identified oil at the Bandon Prospect in the Slyne Basin, off the west coast.  In all three cases further work is required in order to determine whether these accumulations can be progressed to commercial developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">No additional finds of oil and gas have been made so far in 2010. However Shell E &amp; P Ireland Ltd is expected to commence drilling in the Slyne Basin shortly.  There are twenty six active Petroleum Exploration Licences relating to areas of the Irish offshore.  Exploration activities are continuing under all of these authorisations.  The last discovery to be declared commercial was the Seven Heads discovery in July 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">In respect of minerals, there is only one offshore prospecting licence.  That licence covers an area of some 1,000 square kilometres roughly centred on the Kish Bank, is held by VP Power, and is restricted to exploration for coal.  VP Power has carried out a preliminary exploration programme over the area.  There has been no discovery of any mineral deposit.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">The Government is giving high priority to supporting the development of Ireland's ocean energy potential.  Not only will ocean energy contribute to Ireland's renewable energy targets, it has considerable potential for inward investment and enterprise activity in support of economic renewal.  The research activities of the Hydraulics and Maritime Centre at University College Cork are a key part of the Ocean Energy Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The Ocean Energy Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is supporting University College Cork to upgrade the existing wave-basin located at the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC).  The facility provides research and testing facilities for a variety of offshore purposes.  The upgrade of the existing facility includes new wave generating equipment, new experimental test rigs, improved workshop facilities and advanced computer solutions for numerical analysis and modelling.  Expenditure on the upgrade of the facility is estimated at approximately €1 million in 2010.  SEAI is also working with the UCC Marine Institute, UCC and other industry stakeholders in putting in place an enhanced management and operational structure for the HMRC reflective of its role in the national ocean energy research programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">The Irish gas market has been fully opened up to competition since July 2007.  Experience in other markets has shown that there is a time lag between full market opening and the emergence of fully viable competition.  The very small size of the Irish gas market by international standards, with some 640,000 customers, adds to the challenge of creating competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">Competition in the upper segments of the market is continuing to develop and there are now eight licensed suppliers. The largest users of gas are the power generating stations and a small number of large energy users (LEUs) who account for 66% of total gas demand.  This segment is not regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Large commercial and industrial customers account for a further 10% of the market in volume terms.  There are about 245 customers in this category.  The current regime of regulation in this sector is known as the Regulated Tariff Formula (RTF) regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The RFT is based on the gas commodity cost, transmission and distribution costs, plus margin.  This regime was introduced as an interim measure in 2003 to encourage competition in this sector.  At that time Bord Gáis Energy (BGEnergy) had 100% of the market of the sector. In volume terms BGEnergy now has 39.8% of the sector with the independent suppliers holding the balance.  I am advised by the CER that their current review of the RTF is in line with its commitment to keep under regular review the case for retaining or removing the RTF regime.  Public consultation on this review has recently closed and I expect the CER to make a balanced and evidence based decision on the issue taking appropriate account of various perspectives.  A decision is due to be taken by end May.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">The smaller Industrial and Commercial customers are regulated by the Fuel Variation Tariff segment (FVT).  They account for only 4% in volume terms of the market.  This segment is also regulated by means of a price regulated mechanism.  The domestic gas tariff continues to be regulated with the CER setting the BGE supply tariffs twice a year.  Pending the emergence of meaningful competition, the CER has no immediate proposals to deregulate either the FVT or domestic segments. BGE supply tariffs for domestic customers will continue to be set on a twice yearly basis by the CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">The nature of regulation is to drive improved efficiencies and to lower costs in areas that are under regulatory control.  This is designed to benefit customers first and foremost.  The CER has stated that it will consult on a road map for deregulation in the gas retail sector, analogous to the new road map for deregulation of the electricity retail sector, when the time is appropriate.  I welcome that commitment.  The continued entry of new suppliers into the gas market, with both Phoenix and ESBIE entering in 2009, demonstrates that regulatory policy to underpin the growth of competition in gas supply has paid dividends for consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_880">The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the Government's strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand, deliver smart networks and enable greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  The harnessing of renewable energy and the development of micro generation and electric vehicles, is creating an utterly different supply and demand energy landscape.  Smart metering systems are intrinsic to the transformation of the energy system.  The integration of energy and ICT systems will deliver an energy network which looks a lot more like the Internet than a traditional grid.  I have asked my Department to work with the Commission for Energy Regulation and ESB Networks to explore the synergies between the national electric vehicle programme and the smart meter programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">The current pilot phase of the smart meter programme,  is underway as planned.  The technology trials are continuing to test a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  The Customer Behaviour trials are determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.  In a new development, the potential for a Smart Metering Prepayment Model, similar to the "Pay As You Go" mobile telecommunications arrangements, is now being assessed by the Smart Metering Steering Group for use in both electricity and gas.  A prepayment pilot is now under way with ESB Customer Supply staff in advance of a trial with ESB Customer Supply customers, which is expected to get underway next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The electricity element of the pilot phase went "Live" in January of this year and will be completed at the end of December 2010.  The electricity technology trial is examining metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  Up to 5,000 meters have been deployed to accommodate technology testing in Limerick/Ennis, Cork City/Bandon and South Dublin/Wicklow.  Significant progress has also been made in the gas element of the pilot phase.  Over 1,900 meters have been deployed for Gas Customer Behaviour Trials.  A further 750 meters will accommodate Gas Technology Trials.  The benchmarking period for the gas element of the Customer Behaviour Trial commenced in December 2009 and will continue until end May 2010.  The gas customer behaviour and technology gas trials will "Go Live" in June and will continue until end May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">A key component of the smart meter pilot is the associated cost benefit analysis, which will critically inform future decisions.  An interim analysis will be completed this year with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid 2011.  Smart Metering is now seen at European Union level as a critical dimension of energy demand management in the interests of consumers and businesses.  I am pleased to say that Ireland is to the forefront among Member States in making real progress on the smart meter agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">The pattern of expenditure to date reflects the fact that work to progress the grid connected test site was at a very preliminary stage during 2009 and the approved prototype funding support is being disbursed over the two years 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">SEAI, working with ESB International, the Marine Institute and industry stakeholders, is developing the grid connected site off Annagh Point, County Mayo.  This facility will provide for the testing of operational pre-commercial wave energy devices directly connected to the electricity network.  The test site will be a key enabler for the development of an ocean energy industry in Ireland. An exploratory foreshore licence was granted to SEAI in September 2009, which has enabled site investigation works to commence at the planned test site location.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">SEAI, under the Ocean Energy Prototype Development Fund, has approved funding support totalling €4.35m for 12 projects from over 30 expressions of interest received.  The funding support is designed to stimulate the commercial development and deployment of ocean energy devices that can generate renewable electricity.  Additional projects are being assessed at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">Currently around 96% of Ireland's gas needs are met by imports from the UK via the two subsea interconnectors with Scotland. This infrastructure also supplies the gas needs of Northern Ireland, through the Scotland Northern Ireland Pipeline, and the Isle of Man.  The three interconnectors are operated by Gaslink, a subsidiary of Bord Gáis, on behalf of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.  International treaties between the Governments of Ireland and the UK were signed on the construction of each of the two subsea interconnectors.  The Treaties set out the terms for the operation of the pipelines and include provisions on security.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">There also are gas emergency arrangements in place between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a need to reduce gas load in the UK, the arrangements provide that Ireland, Northern Ireland and  the Isle of Man will be given equal treatment on a pro rata basis.  Emergency plans for both gas and electricity are tested with the UK through joint annual emergency exercises.  Given the high level of integration of the UK and Ireland's gas systems, there is a close bilateral working relationship with the UK on energy security issues, including liaison on EU developments.  The interests of Northern Ireland are also fully reflected under the bilateral framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">These bilateral arrangements will be enhanced through the framework for regional and EU cooperation on security of gas supply under the European gas security of supply regulations.  The Regulation is expected to be adopted later in the year.  The Regulation will require Member States to formally consult with each other as part of their emergency planning processes.  This provision will underpin the existing arrangements between Ireland and the UK.  We will continue to work very closely with the UK and Northern Ireland to ensure optimum coordination of existing emergency arrangements.  We will also be fully collaborating with the UK to ensure maximum coordination on the implementation of the forthcoming Regulation to mutual benefit.  This includes the further formal enshrining, as necessary, of bilateral arrangements for security and emergency planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Apart from cooperation with the North and the UK, there are other fora for regional cooperation where issues related to energy supply and security arise.  We work closely with our colleagues in the energy sectoral group of the British-Irish Council (BIC), specifically on grid infrastructure and marine energy issues. The BIC Members are Ireland, Northern Ireland, the UK, Scotland, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.  The enhancement of the Grid linking these islands, and with mainland Europe, is a key opportunity to realise greater levels of security of supply and sustainability. I discussed these issues with my colleagues at the inaugural Ministerial meeting of the BIC Energy Group in London recently and we will explore opportunities for enhanced cooperation again at the BIC Summit in Guernsey in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">One area for discussion between BIC members relates to the announcement of the EU North Seas Grid Initiative on 7 December 2009. Under this initiative, the Irish and UK Governments have agreed to work with the Governments of Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden and Norway to develop an integrated offshore grid in the North and Irish Seas.  In addition, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland are conducting the Irish Scottish Links in Electricity Study (ISLES) study to establish the viability of an offshore electricity grid network to exploit wind, wave and tidal resources in the Irish Sea and Atlantic coastal areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">The Fuel Poverty Action Research Report involved an ex-post assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the Warmer Homes Scheme, which retrofits low income private homes with insulation and other energy saving measures.  The research was carried out between 2007 and 2009 and predates the increased funding and activity under the Scheme.  The study was based on a sample of 600 households.  Interviews were carried out in 348 homes in Cork and 252 homes in Donegal.  Households were surveyed prior to energy efficiency measures being installed and surveyed again following the installation of these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The Report concludes that the Warmer Homes Scheme has been effective stating that "The research has found that the Warmer Homes Scheme has had a significant impact on reducing fuel poverty".  The Report also concludes that the programme has had demonstrable impact in the sample group as evidenced by a significant decline in the number of households reporting difficulty in being able to afford to heat their home in winter.  It also reports a significant decline in the proportion of households not using rooms in their home because of lack of heat or having difficulty in paying their utility bills on time.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The Report is not a complete evaluation of the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS).  However, it makes a useful contribution to understanding of the various dimensions of fuel poverty and endorses the value and efficacy of the scheme.  The primary goal of the WHS is to alleviate fuel poverty, with additional positive impacts in terms of overall energy demand reduction.  The study measured the fuel poverty impact in several ways and finds clear evidence of positive impacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has carried out its own internal cost benefit analysis of the current Warmer Homes programme.  SEAI's analysis confirms that energy savings are achieved as well as the primary goal of fuel poverty alleviation.  SEAI concludes that the economic value of the energy savings is greater than the programme costs.  I am satisfied that the programme is having a positive economic impact even before placing an economic value on its fuel poverty alleviation and health impacts.</p>

            <p eId="para_907">The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), was launched in March 2009.  The scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.  The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">The scheme had attracted 40,724 applications by the end of December 2009.  Some €16.26 million was paid out by SEAI by the end of the year, representing 33,434 energy efficient measures installed in 18,183 homes.  The scheme allows homeowners six months, from the date of grant approval, to have the work undertaken.  As a result, some monies committed in 2009 are being drawn down in 2010.   This year to date, there has been a very significant increase in activity and expenditure.  Some €27m million has already been paid out by SEAI since March 2009, representing almost 60,000 energy efficient measures being installed in 30,000 homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Funding in 2010 of €90m has been allocated to SEAI for the further expansion of its domestic, business and public sector energy efficiency schemes.  A further €40m has been allocated by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improving the energy efficiency of social housing across the country.  This unprecedented level of funding will support energy efficiency improvements in over 60,000 homes and buildings,<b> </b>support 5,000 jobs and create energy efficiency savings worth a total of €400 million over their lifetime.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">In tandem with the increased level of activity in existing programmes in 2010, detailed proposals for the new Retrofit Programme announced in the Budget are being finalised.   I will be bringing these proposals to Government shortly with a view to launching the programme towards the end of the year.  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the HES and the WHS as well as support programmes for businesses and the public sector.  The programme will see new initiatives involving energy supply companies, energy service providers, and the construction sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">This new programme has the potential to be the most innovative, ambitious, energy-related initiative ever introduced in Ireland.  It will significantly contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.  It is the case that pending the finalisation and introduction of the retrofit programme, the HES and the WHS remain fully open for business in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the making of a levy order by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) for the purposes of meeting the expenses of the Authority and its Committees in undertaking the performance of its statutory functions.  The BAI has reviewed its initial budget of €7.632 million for 2010 and has set a revised budget at €6.020 million. Following a decision by the Authority not to include the BAI's depreciation charge of €365,000 the amount to be funded by industry levy amounts to €5.635 million, a total reduction of almost €2 million on the original budget.  This will mean that the levy on independent radio stations will be considerably reduced as compared with the original budget.  This should significantly assist the sector in what, I accept, is a difficult commercial climate for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">I understand the Authority has advised that it is committed to minimising the burden on industry and it has requested the Chief Executive to continuously review its proposed expenditure throughout 2010 with the aim of reducing it where possible.  In accordance with section 33 of the Act, any surplus of levy income over expenditure in 2010 shall be offset against future levies or refunded, as appropriate.  The BAI has published details of its estimated income and expenditure for 2010 on its website www.bai.ie.  In addition, at the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on 31 March 2010 the BAI undertook to review the levy and the levy order during the year with a view to measuring its impact and it is anticipated that they will report on this in Q1 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">My Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General has been working to progress a scheme to provide for the recovery of carbon windfall gains from electricity generators to the end of the current EU Emissions Trading Scheme in 2012.  The Single Electricity Market Committee has statutory responsibility for the operation of the all island electricity market.  The Committee decided in 2008 that the full costs of the free carbon allocations should be passed through to the market. This has been a cause of considerable concern to business because of the impact on the wholesale cost of electricity. Business Groups have also expressed concerns about the related carbon windfall profits earned by electricity generators.  These concerns have been raised consistently in the context of energy costs for business and their impact on competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">In July last year the Government agreed a series of measures to mitigate where possible energy costs for business.  As part of those measures the Government decided to progress the introduction of legislation to recover carbon windfall gains from generators up to 2012.  There are legal, technical and other complex considerations inherent in any potential treatment of carbon windfall gains.  My Department has been working to comprehensively address all these considerations. I can advise the Deputy that, subject to final legal drafting, I intend to introduce amendments at Committee stage of the Biofuels Obligation Bill which is currently before the House and which will place a levy upon electricity generators to recover a substantial proportion of these gains.  These amendments will be circulated shortly and I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_921">I am working closely with the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to ensure a fully cohesive approach to energy affordability.  The Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy was established in the summer of 2008 to coordinate the cross-Government and cross-industry work in this area.  This Group is jointly chaired by the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Social Protection, and includes the Departments of An Taoiseach, Finance, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Health and Children, along with the Commission for Energy Regulation, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Institute of Public Health, ESB,  Bord Gáis Éireann and, more recently, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">Work is under way, led by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, on the Energy Affordability Strategy.  The Strategy will set out actions under way and proposed further actions to protect vulnerable households with a view to ensuring that existing and future measures are targeted at households where the risk of energy poverty is greatest.  A public consultation process was launched in March this year seeking the views of interested parties on all dimensions of energy affordability by 23 April.  Informed by the consultation process, the Strategy will be finalised and submitted to Government in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements is pivotal to the Government's strategy to address energy affordability.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in nearly 40,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), of which 5,343 homes were completed in 2008 and 19,000 in 2009 (including nearly 3,000 homes delivered by the ESB according to WHS specification).  Some €15 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, with a further €5 million provided by ESB and BGE.  Of the €15 million Exchequer allocation €12.4m was spent under the scheme last year.  Funding of €13m has been provided to the scheme in 2010 and, to date this year, the WHS has been delivered to 4,096 homes.  The target for the Warmer Homes Scheme is 22,500 homes in 2010. We are confident of achieving this level.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The WHS provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is primarily delivered by community based organisations (CBOs) of which 22 have, to date, been approved to provide this service.  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of St. Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors were also engaged in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_927">I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 67 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 provides for RTÉ to develop a "free-to-view" digital broadcasting service as a replacement for the national analogue TV service currently offering access to RTÉ 1, RTÉ2, TV3 and TG4 and for the subsequent closure of the national analogue TV service.  The Act also provides opportunities for the development of a commercial digital terrestrial television (DTT) service in Ireland.  In this regard, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), an independent regulatory authority, is required to provide for the development of commercial DTT services.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">The BAI's predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), initiated a competition for a commercial DTT service provider.  The highest placed consortium withdrew from the process in April of last year.  As a result negotiations commenced with the next placed bidder, OneVision.  These negotiations are still ongoing.  As I have stated in this House in reply to previous questions on this matter, I am not prepared to speculate or hypothesise on the outcome of what is a commercial licensing process.  This is a matter for the BAI.  I have repeatedly made it very clear to the Authority that I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible so that clarity and certainty with regard to commercial DTT can be provided to broadcasters and viewers alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">My priority, in accordance with national policy, is to provide for the closure, in 2012, of the analogue "free-to-view" broadcasting service.  The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch off throughout Europe and the EU Council of Ministers has asked Member States to complete switch over by 2012 in so far as possible.  It is my intention that this switch off will be no later than quarter four 2012.  RTÉ is aware of this and is supportive of the quarter four 2012 deadline.  In this regard, and in the continuing absence of commercial DTT, I have recently signed an Order, Statutory Instrument 85 of 2010, under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requiring RTÉ to launch a "free-to-view" DTT service to approximately 90% of the population by 31st October 2010.  The 2009 Act also requires RTÉ to provide the full national "free-to-view" digital service, capable of carrying RTÉ 1, RTÉ 2, TG4 and TV3, by the end of 2011 or such date as I may specify.  In this regard I have informed RTÉ that the date for the provision of a national service is 31st December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">From a broadcaster perspective, the development of DTT services provides more for TV viewers in terms of choice and services.  The RTÉ multiplex has sufficient space for 8-10 TV channels, radio channels and electronic programme guides and the legislation provides for RTÉ to exploit space on the multiplex for commercial purposes.  A second RTÉ multiplex, provided for under the 2009 Act, provides for RTÉ to roll out high definition (HD) services which will also be made available to TV viewers in Ireland on a "free-to-view" basis.  More significantly, there are considerable economic benefits for Ireland resulting from the switch off of the analogue broadcast services and the consequent release and reuse of this valuable spectrum, which is known as the digital dividend.  The digital dividend is a clear enabler of economic and social growth.  By extrapolating from a recent European study, the value of the digital dividend to Ireland is expected to be between €2 billion and €10 billion, over 15 years.  In this regard, it is vital for Ireland's economic health that this spectrum is released as early as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_935">The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital radio in Ireland.  Under this Act, RTÉ is given the right to operate a multiplex for the purposes of providing a digital sound broadcasting service.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is responsible for the development of commercial digital sound broadcasting services.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is responsible for managing the spectrum and for licensing spectrum to both the BAI and RTÉ in respect of sound broadcasting services.  In addition the Broadcasting Act provides an incentive, in the form of an extended licence term, for existing commercial radio stations to simulcast on a digital multiplex.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">From 2006 to 2008, RTÉ operated a trial of DAB services on a number of sites in Ireland.  This trial also included commercial sound broadcasters.   Since the trial ended RTÉ has received a licence from ComReg and has developed a number of new RTÉ sound broadcast stations specifically for their DAB service i.e. RTÉ Junior, RTÉ Choice, RTÉ Pulse, RTÉ Gold, RTÉ Chill and RTÉ 2xm.  The present service is available in the greater Dublin area, the North East of the country, Cork City and Limerick City.  Commercial radio stations are not available on this DAB service.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">In 2009 the BAI conducted research into digital radio and they plan to develop a policy for the licensing of commercial digital radio services in Ireland this year.  The amount spent on DAB in Ireland to date is an operational issue for RTÉ and the BAI.  I have asked both organisations to revert to the Deputy with this information.  Unlike the case of digital television, there is no imperative on broadcasters to "go digital" — this is purely a commercial decision for broadcasters.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">I am supportive of the development of digital radio.  Digital radio provides opportunities for the development of more radio channels which can offer a greater variety of content and more choice for listeners.  In addition, digital radio offers the potential to provide value added services such as data information services.  In this regard, digital radio is seen as an opportunity for sound broadcasters to expand their businesses and to provide innovative and novel content to their audience.  The choice of technology for digital radio services is one for broadcasters and the BAI.   As with all new technologies, these are constantly evolving and improving and there are a number of factors — practical, economic, spectrum efficiency, timing, technological, consumer cost and service related issues that will need to be considered by broadcasters and the BAI in making the technology choices.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_940">The Government is firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices and also to ensuring diversity of energy supplies, with a particular focus on renewable energy, in order to reduce our exposure to volatile external fuel prices.  The Government supports continued significant investment in Ireland's electricity and gas networks to further underpin security and reliability of supply.  Government policy has resulted in significant progress in the development of competitive electricity markets, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM) now in place, the sale of ESB generation capacity and the entry of new international players such as Endesa and Scottish and Southern Electricity to the Irish and all-island market.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Ireland has a fleet of new, efficient and reliable gas-fired generating stations, with two more coming online in the next few months, as well as significant new wind generation capacity which is increasing competition further and exerting downward pressure on prices.  Falling gas prices in the UK market are also having a direct impact on SEM wholesale electricity prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">Recognising the concerns of indigenous business and the inward investment community, particularly in view of the difficult economic circumstances, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.  In 2009, all electricity consumers benefited from direct rebates totalling €567m. In July 2009 the Government agreed that these rebates would continue for large energy users at the same level until October 2010 and would then be phased out over the following few years.  These measures are having a significant impact on Ireland's international competitiveness. The latest comparative statistics available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's publication show that Ireland experienced the third largest price drop in electricity prices to industry across the entire EU over the 12 month period ending on 30th June 2009. At the same time, 22 of 27 EU countries experienced price increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has a statutory function to advise the Minister on developments in the electricity and gas markets.  In this context the CER engages on a regular basis, both with me and my Department, on issues relating to energy prices and competition.  Working with the CER, my Department is also pursuing further permanent structural changes to our electricity markets that will benefit business.  These changes include some re-balancing of network tariffs, as well as recovering carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The entry into the domestic electricity market last year of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord Gáis Energy, demonstrates that policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is benefiting domestic as well as business consumers through, for example, discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB unit rates.  The independent suppliers are also offering domestic consumers alternative billing arrangements and options for the level of renewable electricity they purchase.  On foot of the high rates of switching in all segments of the electricity market, the CER recently published a decision on the road map for ESB price deregulation.  This is an important step on the path to developing a fully competitive electricity market in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">The CER has also committed to further consultations on important consumer measures including improving general customer awareness and encouraging active market participation across all parts of the domestic market. In this regard, my Department is also working on enhanced consumer protection and information provisions in the context of the transposition of the third EU internal energy market package of legislation, with the objective of ensuring that all consumers can benefit fully from the competitive electricity market.</p>

            <p eId="para_947">The International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2009 notes that the unexpected boom in North American unconventional gas production, together with the current recession's depressive impact on demand, is expected to contribute to a glut of gas supply in the next few years.  This new gas supply has driven down US prices and reduced LNG imports to the U.S., which in turn have become available and increased supply in other markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">A key security of supply imperative for the EU, where over half of the gas consumed is from sources outside Europe, is to ensure diversification of supply routes and sources of gas.  Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is increasingly a component of this strategy as Member States work to diversify supply sources and routes.  To the extent that LNG is sourced from different countries to those exporting pipeline gas, it can lessen exposure to price volatility and supply disruptions.  The EU is already heavily interconnected with gas supply routes to Norway, Russia, Algeria and Libya. LNG supplies to Europe are currently sourced from Norway, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, Oman and Malaysia.  Most of these countries are seen as largely stable political regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">LNG imports account for approximately 15% of the total EU gas market.  LNG supplies to North West Europe have increased in line with the coming on-stream in 2009 of new LNG facilities in UK, Italy and elsewhere, the current competitive price of LNG on world markets and with increased availability of supplies.  The gas market generally, and the LNG market in particular, is much less price-volatile than in 2007 or 2008.  Currently, a well supplied US gas market together with declining global demand is contributing to lower spot market prices which could help break the oil price link in the longer term gas contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">Ireland's demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports across the gas interconnectors from the UK.  Declining production and storage at Kinsale, now supplying around 4%, accounts for the remainder.  Irish imports account for around 5% of the UK gas market.  The majority of UK gas demand is currently being met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.  Through the gas interconnectors with Great Britain, Ireland has access to diverse sources of supply, including UK indigenous production, Norwegian imports and UK LNG imports and indirectly, to physical interconnection with mainland Europe.  The UK has access to worldwide LNG markets through its significant recent investment in LNG terminals and LNG now plays an increasingly important part in the UK's gas supplies.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">It is prudent, in light of Ireland's dependence on gas imported from the UK, to work to reduce our reliance on this source.  In addition to bringing Corrib gas production on stream, opportunities for LNG and for gas storage are being facilitated.  The island of Ireland currently has no LNG import capability.  However, Shannon LNG is at an advanced stage in the project to build an LNG facility on the Shannon estuary.  The proposed ‘merchant' LNG terminal would provide additional security of supply here, in that it would bring diversity to Ireland's supply sources and would bring direct connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland.  Shannon LNG has been awarded planning permission for an LNG import facility and terminal under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The safety standards applying to an LNG facility are primarily the responsibilities of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and the Commission for Energy Regulation both of whom have stringent regulations and standards in place under the EC Seveso Directive and other EU Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">The Government's Energy Policy Framework 2007 sets out a target for co-firing in peat stations of 30% by 2015.  Both ESB and Bord na Móna have been conducting a programme of research and development, including large scale co-firing trials with a variety of materials.  The trials have also encompassed laboratory tests on the chemical and physical properties of various materials.  Decisions by ESB and Bord na Móna on what material to co-fire and the timing of the move to introduce large scale co-firing will be taken in light of the ongoing trials.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">Both companies have been in discussions with a number of market players around sourcing potential supplies for the co-firing material.  The companies themselves will be responsible for making the commercial decisions to award any such contracts.  The objective is to utilise domestically produced biomass as much as possible, and my Department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture to ensure that their support schemes for energy crops and forestry are in alignment with the scale of demand that may ultimately arise as a result of the co-firing process.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_957">Over recent months there has been renewed interest in targeting the natural gas resource potential of the Northwest Carboniferous and Clare basins which had been identified in earlier exploration, but not deemed commercial at that time.  In March of this year, I announced a competition for Onshore Licensing Options over the two areas.  The acreage on offer covers an area of approximately 8,000 square kilometres over parts of counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo in the North West Carboniferous Basin and parts of counties Clare, Cork, Limerick and Kerry in the Clare Basin.  The closing date for receipt of applications is Friday 11th June 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">Licensing Options awarded from this competition will be for a maximum period of two years and will be subject to an agreed work programme.  Work programmes will include procurement of all available relevant technical data/studies and new geological/geophysical studies/data acquisition as considered necessary.  Work programmes will not include drilling, but may include shallow geological sampling where subsurface penetrations would typically not exceed 100-200m.  The holder of any Licensing Option awarded will have the first right to a Petroleum Exploration Licence over all or part of the area covered by the Option.  At the end of the Option period, the holder must either apply for a Petroleum Exploration Licence or surrender the acreage.  Any Petroleum Exploration Licence awarded over the area would be subject to a commitment by the licensee to drill an exploration well in the first three years of the licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The 2007 Licensing Terms for Oil and Gas, Exploration, Development and Production apply to all petroleum exploration licences issued after 1st January 2007.  The 2007 terms provide for a new profit resource rent tax, payable at rates of up to 15%, in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate previously applying.  The 2007 terms ensure that the return to the State will increase to a maximum of 40% in the case of the most profitable fields.  The general rate of corporation tax is 12.5%.  Ireland in common with other countries such as the UK and Norway moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Under the tax based system the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of the oil or gas field.</p>

            <p eId="para_964">The Micro Generation Programme is being operated by ESB Customer Supply and supported by ESB Networks.  The programme has the potential to provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid.  The ESB advises that, to date, 240 customers have signed up for the scheme — 215 in the wind category and 25 in the solar photovoltaic category.  ESB Networks have received a further 400 enquiries from householders that are at various stages of developing micro generator installations.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">I am committed to supporting the development of microgeneration as part of the transformation of the network from a centralised system to a smart energy system.  Microgeneration can play an increasing role in reducing energy emissions and also in reducing exposure to imported fossil fuels.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is carrying out ongoing monitoring and assessment of their existing programme of micro-generation plants.  The purpose of the programme, among other things, is to bring forward appropriate technical standards, including safety standards, for micro-scale equipment and to inform the development of dedicated training standards for installers of micro generation technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">My Department will continue to work with the SEAI, the Commission for Energy Regulation, ESB and other electricity supply companies to increase the uptake of microgeneration among electricity consumers, including the provision of requisite supports where justified.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">The recently published decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) on the road map for electricity price deregulation is an important step on the path to developing a fully competitive electricity market in Ireland.  This decision demonstrates that Government and regulatory policy to encourage competition is paying dividends through lower prices and greater choice for Irish homes and businesses.  The outcome of the road map decision is that ESB retail tariffs for business customers will no longer be regulated by the CER.  The decision paper also sets out the criteria for deregulation of tariffs in the domestic market.  Among these criteria is the reduction of ESB domestic market share to below 60%.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">I endorse the CER view that this is likely to happen in the not-too-distant future.  This assessment is based on the continued high rate of customer switching in the domestic market.  Since early 2009, when BGE and Airtricity first entered the domestic market, some 23% of domestic customers have already switched supplier.  This is a testament to the sophistication of Irish energy consumers, who are also clearly interested in the new options on offer such as alternative billing arrangements and more environmentally friendly electricity supplies, as well as value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">In addition to monitoring market shares and switching rates, it is important to ensure that all Irish consumers can benefit from a fully competitive and deregulated electricity market.  I therefore welcome the CER commitment to take full action to enhance consumer awareness and full market transparency across all parts of the domestic market.  My Department is also working on delivering enhanced consumer protection and information provisions as part of the transposition of the third EU internal energy market package of legislation.</p>

The tender competition closed on the 12th March, 2010.  Subsequently, a technical issue arose relating to the consistency of the Request for Tenders with the requirements of the Public Procurement Regulations.  Bidders were notified by letter of the cancellation of the tender and a notice to that effect was posted on the e-tenders website on the 15th April, 2010.

            <p eId="para_978">Under Phase I of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme there were 27 MANs constructed in conjunction with the Local and Regional Authorities.  These have been managed by e|net under a concession agreement since July 2004.  24 of these towns currently have a backhaul connection but 3 towns do not.  They are Gweedore, Carrickmacross and Kingscourt.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">A further 59 networks across 65 towns were constructed under Phase II of the MANs Programme.  One other MAN in Kinsale, Co. Cork is under construction.  In December 2007 I suspended construction of additional Phase II networks that had not yet commenced pending the outcome of the Value for Money and Policy Review (VFMPR) of Phase I of the MANs Programme and my Next Generation Broadband policy paper.  This resulted in the suspension of 27 Phase II networks.   MANs that were under construction at that time proceeded as planned, i.e. the 60 MANs that comprise Phase II of the Programme.  Following a procurement process a concession agreement was signed in July 2009 with e|net for the management of these networks.  To date 51 Phase II networks have been handed over to e|net with the remaining networks due to be handed over by end May 2010.  There are currently eight Phase II towns with a backhaul connection.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">It should be noted that the MANs were designed to allow interconnection with backhaul providers through co-location cabins located close to backhaul network infrastructure and all MANs are capable of getting backhaul connectivity through at least one backhaul network.  e|net are exploring other ways to provide backhaul connectivity to these MANs.  While some of the MANs remain unconnected to a backhaul network, it is the case that such MANs, which enhance the attractiveness of the locations for indigenous and foreign investment, are ready to meet the demand for fibre connectivity should that demand arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">My Department are finalising an appraisal exercise which will result in a recommendation regarding the future of the MANs Programme.  The position remains that any future phase of the MANs programme will be guided by: (i) the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband, which was published in June 2009; (ii) the Value for Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs Programme, which was published in July 2008; and (iii) the availability of resources.</p>

         the new measures he will take to ensure Ireland’s cost of energy is tackled in view of concerns expressed by the commercial sector about the high cost of energy here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [16656/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_478">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_983">The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a serious competitiveness issue facing the enterprise sector during this difficult period for the economy.  The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy.  Ireland's high energy costs, by comparison with much of Europe, are primarily due to significant dependence on volatile imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well as a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">Recognising the concerns of indigenous business and the inward investment community, particularly in view of the difficult economic conditions, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.  All electricity users benefited in 2009 from direct rebates totalling €567m.  These were made up of an ESB rebate to consumers of €315m, a repayment of certain Public Service Obligation (PSO) levies of €87m and the deferral of some network revenues until after October 2009.  In July the Government agreed that these rebates would continue for large energy users at their current level until October 2010 and would then be phased out over the following two year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">In addition, arising from their review of prices last year, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) lowered electricity prices for all customers by 10% and gas tariffs by an average of 12% for domestic and SME gas customers from May 1st 2009. Small to Medium businesses have seen further reductions in their electricity bills of 5.5% since October 2009 as the new CER tariff decisions came.  The CER approved an average decrease in gas tariffs of 9.8% with effect from 1 October 2009, followed by a further 8% reduction in BGE's unit charges from 1 February 2010.  These reductions were made possible by steady declines over recent months in wholesale gas prices in the UK market and also by appreciation of the Euro against Sterling.  Business customers can also avail of the competitive benefits of value and choice by shopping around for alternative electricity and gas suppliers.  Competition in the business electricity market has developed to such an extent that the CER has recently decided to end price regulation for ESB in this market segment.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Working with the CER, my Department is also pursuing further permanent structural changes to our electricity markets that will benefit business.  These changes include some re-balancing of network tariffs, as well as recovering carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.  The CER is also close to completion of a 5-year review of electricity network expenditure.  The review is designed to ensure that ESB and EirGrid make even greater efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure, thus minimising costs for consumers. CER will ensure that this review is rigorous notably in the interests of mitigating energy costs for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">These measures are already having a significant impact on Ireland's international competitiveness.  The latest comparative statistics available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's publication show that Ireland experienced the third largest price drop in electricity prices to industry across the entire EU over the 12 month period ending on 30th June 2009. At the same time, 22 of 27 EU countries experienced price increases. Gas prices also continued to fall with a result that gas prices are now 7% to 10% below the EU average in the two main consumption bands for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in place, the sale of ESB generation capacity, entry of new players and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.</p>

        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         his plans to roll out combined heat and power plants fuelled by biomass in public buildings across the country.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_990">Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is a highly efficient way of generating on-site heat and electricity simultaneously.  It can offer significantly reduced energy bills for the end user and is a particularly efficient form of energy generation as it minimises any transmission losses involved in getting power to the site.  Traditionally, CHP plants were only used in large industrial units with a high on-site heat load.  Increasingly the technology is developing higher efficiency, smaller scale units that are capable of servicing smaller buildings and residential houses.  As this technology becomes more common in the market, smaller commercial premises, public buildings, can now reduce their energy costs by installing CHP systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Deployment Programme for CHP technologies.  The programme was expanded in 2008 to include dedicated support for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion powered CHP.  Under the SEAI Support Programme a significant number of Public Buildings have taken advantage of the benefits of CHP, or are currently in the process of doing so.  These include academic institutions which have installed CHP systems, with a total electrical capacity of 850 kilowatts.  Two more institutions are in the process of installing systems with an electrical capacity of 750 kilowatts.  In the Health sector, five hospitals have already installed CHP systems with a total electrical capacity of 770 kilowatts.  Three local authorities have also installed systems with an electrical capacity of 350 kilowatts, with one more in construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">The Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), which incentivises the installation of biomass boilers, is also open to institutional users of heat, and has already supported the construction of a number of projects.  Taken together, CHP technologies and the projects supported by Reheat offer real solutions to energy costs in these public buildings by reducing the cost of power and increasing the overall energy efficiency of the buildings.  SEAI and my Department are in ongoing discussions with the OPW and other Government Departments and agencies to increase the deployment of CHP further into the public building programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_994">EirGrid publishes comprehensive and regularly updated lists of connected wind farms and contracted wind farms throughout the country on its website.  EirGrid's most recent report of 8 February advises that there are just over 100 wind farms connected to the grid with an installed wind capacity of 1,264MW.  There are an additional 100 wind farms with a total contracted capacity of 1,415MW which have contracted for grid connections which will be built over the next number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">It is estimated a total of 1,650 MW of installed renewable capacity will be required to achieve the 15% renewable electricity target this year.  There are sufficient projects with both planning permission and a connection offer to deliver this target with onshore wind remaining dominant.  The latest figures from EirGrid show that there is a further 1,500 MW with signed connection agreements or in the final stages of agreeing one.  The recent Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) decision on the "Gate 3" process provides for connection offers for 3,900 MWs of additional renewable electricity capacity in the short term.  Connection offers for Gate 3 are due to issue between December 2009 and mid 2011.  Major grid infrastructure developments are required to underpin this level of renewable capacity.  EirGrid's Grid25 strategy sets out the overall framework for the investment in the transmission system over the next 15 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) was established in Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) in 2008 and full implementation of the Ocean Energy programme commenced in 2009.  The Government has set an ambitious target of 500MW of ocean energy by 2020.  Ocean energy is currently at the research and development stage globally.  There is no ocean energy device as yet connected to the Irish grid, however there is a demonstration tidal device connected to the grid in Northern Ireland at Strangford Lough.  SEAI is working in conjunction with ESBI, the Marine Institute and other stakeholders to establish a grid connected ocean energy test facility off Annagh Head County Mayo.  The test site will be a key enabler for the development of an ocean energy industry in Ireland.  An exploratory foreshore licence was granted to SEAI in September 2009, which has enabled site investigation works to commence at the planned test site location.  Progressing the test site is a key priority for 2010 in order to ensure that Ireland remains one of the leading countries in the European ocean energy arena.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">SEAI, under the Ocean Energy Prototype Development Fund, has approved funding support totalling €4.35m for 12 projects from over 30 expressions of interest received.  The funding support is designed to stimulate the commercial development and deployment of ocean energy devices that can generate renewable electricity.  Additional projects are being assessed at present.  The Ocean Energy Package announced in 2008 provided funding of €26m over three years.  €7m was allocated to the Ocean Energy Programme for 2009 of which €3.764m was spent, reflecting the fact that work to progress the test site was at a very preliminary stage during 2009 and the approved prototype funding support is being disbursed over the two years 2009 and 2010.  €7.8m has been allocated to the Ocean Energy Programme for 2010 and it is expected that this funding will be fully expended.</p>

            <p eId="para_1001">The Department, and others, have been working, and continue to work on addressing the digital divide with a range of measures to promote digital engagement.  One issue has been access to the technology and infrastructure, which is being addressed both by the market and, in the case of areas where broadband provision remains an issue, through the National Broadband Scheme.  The issue of skills is being addressed in several ways.  Training opportunities are being provided by community, voluntary and not for profit organisations across the country.  The Department's Bene <i>f</i>IT e-Inclusion grant schemes are assisting many of these initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">Under the Bene <i>f</i>IT schemes, 89 grants were awarded in 2008 and 2009 — amounting to approximately €2.58 million.  A review of the outputs from the Bene<i>f</i>IT 1 scheme is underway.  It will, inter alia, determine the number of people trained under the scheme, and will be published on the Department’s website when completed later this year.  Approximately 7,400 training places are available under the Bene<i>f</i>IT 2 scheme this year.  Training throughout 2010 is taking place in venues across the country.  Details of the training, the locations andcontact information for the training providers are available on the Department’s website at www.eInclusion.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">There are, of course, other training opportunities available from a variety of sources — including opportunities in libraries and in night classes throughout the country, and from a range of private sector training providers.  In addition, there is the "Log on, Learn" initiative — a collaborative program between Intel, Microsoft, An Post and the Department of Education and Science.  The programme is designed to match participating transition-year students with older people on a one-to-one basis, to share skills and knowledge with each other.  I understand that over 3,000 people have been trained on this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Government will continue to examine approaches to promote increased digital participation and digital skills in the context of strategies to advance the Knowledge Society.  Future strategies will, inter alia, have regard to the expertise that has been built up by community and voluntary organisations throughout the country which have been delivering training with the assistance of grant aid from the Department and how such organisations and others might play a role in future efforts to promote increased digital engagement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">The objective of the one-stop-shop commitment in the Next Generation Broadband policy paper "Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", is to facilitate telecoms network operators in gaining access to ducting that exists along publicly owned energy, transport and other infrastructure so as to help reduce the cost of fibre roll-out for backhaul networks.  An important step in delivering on this commitment is the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010, which provides that the National Roads Authority (NRA) is the single point of contact for access to ducts on motorways and other national roads.  This means that telecommunications service providers no longer have to approach individual local authorities when seeking such access.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">The legislation also allows the NRA to make a scheme, which will permit it to impose charges for the use of ducts subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport following consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Finance.  I am satisfied that this will provide an open and transparent way of setting access pricing for NRA infrastructure.  I understand the NRA has engaged expertise to assist in developing this new business and that it has been meeting with service providers as part of this process.  I very much welcome this development as it is an example of what I set out to achieve in facilitating open access to State-owned ducting.  Such open access is a clear policy objective of mine.  The NRA model is a significant advance and I will be seeking to extend this approach to other suitable State-owned infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">In relation to the implementation of other policy initiatives, set out in my policy paper "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland <i>”</i>, much progress has also been made:</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">On international connectivity: — The telecoms Points of Presence for the Kelvin project have all been connected to the Kelvin direct international telecoms connectivity which is undergoing three months of final testing for completion of the Kelvin project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The position remains that any future broadband investment decisions, including investment in any further phases of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme, will be guided by (i) the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband, which was published in June 2009 (ii) the Value for Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs Programme, which was published in July 2008 and (iii) the availability of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">On the National Broadband scheme — My Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme ("NBS") in late December 2008.  Since then, 3 has progressed its network roll out and NBS broadband services are now available in more than sixty percent of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions ("ED") to be covered under the Scheme. Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Schools participating in the 100Mbps to post primary schools pilot project have begun to connect to the new high speed network with all scheduled to be connected in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">The majority of broadband subscriptions, 68%  residential and 75% non-residential, are now in the 2-10 Mbps range,  higher speeds, in some cases up to 50Mbps are alsoavailable to residential and SME customers and up to 24Mbps are becoming more generally available from DSL providers which is contributing to  the higher speeds target for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">ComReg's current Strategy Statement and its draft Strategy Statement to 2012, recently published for comment, are consistent with the targets to provide a proportionate regulatory framework to permit competition and effective spectrum management and use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">As regards the Broadband Task Force, an industry position, agreed by service providers is a prerequisite to progressing such a Task Force effectively.  Such a position would provide the setting for a meaningful discussion involving industry, ComReg and my officials on how best to facilitate the roll out of Next Generation Access.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1023">I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">It is this Government's policy that telecommunications and broadband services should be provided in the first instance by electronic communications service providers.  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  As part of its pledge to attain universal access to broadband by the end of 2010, set out in the policy document "Next Generation Broadband: Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", the Government has taken a number of initiatives to bring broadband services to those parts of the country where operators have not been able to offer a service on a commercial basis.  In addition to initiatives such as the Group Broadband Scheme and the Metropolitan Area Networks, under the Government's National Broadband Scheme, 3, a Hutchinson Whampoa Company, is required to provide broadband services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  The roll-out of the Scheme is scheduled to be completed by the end of September next.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS, there will be a relatively small percentage of premises, outside of the areas covered by the scheme, which may continue to have difficulty in accessing a broadband service. This is mainly due to difficulties in signal coverage from fixed and mobile wireless service providers or technical difficulties with telephone lines. It was not possible to include such premises in the NBS scheme at the time of its planning due to the need to avoid competition difficulties with existing operators in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">In order to address this issue, my Department has undertaken the design and implementation of a rural broadband scheme that will provide basic broadband to un-served rural premises outside the NBS areas.  The European Commission has provided funding for this scheme through the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP).  This funding is being administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  A total of €17.884m is available for the initiative and State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Taking account of the time necessary to design the scheme and to put the appropriate arrangements in place, I hope to be in a position to launch the first part of the scheme (identifying and verifying the applicants) in September this year.  At that time I would also expect that a procurement process will be under way to identify a service provider for the Scheme.  My current target is for the service provider to be appointed and roll-out to start in mid-2011.  Information relating to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available when the scheme is launched.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1029">The European Union has set ambitious renewable energy targets as part of its overall Climate Change and Energy policies with the objective of achieving 20% of all energy in the EU to be from renewable sources by 2020.  As part of this process, each Member State was set an individual target and Ireland's target was set at 16%.  Ireland's target of 40% of electricity being generated from renewable energy is consistent with our overall energy target.  The EU has singled out the offshore renewable energy sector for particular attention, with offshore wind identified for large scale deployment and wave and tidal sources identified as playing some part in delivering on the 2020 targets but playing an increasing role after 2020 in terms of large scale fully commercial deployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">Ireland has a sea area that is around 10 times the size of its land area. Ireland's location at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean ensures one of the best wind and wave resources in Europe.  There is very significant potential in utilising these resources to generate carbon free renewable electricity initially to provide electricity to the island of Ireland, but also in time to export electricity to the UK and to Continental Europe.  It is clear that the level of renewable resources available to us far exceeds the immediate requirements of our own electricity market.  As well as delivering on our own national targets there is a real potential to develop an electricity export market, subject to economically viable grid interconnections being developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">EirGrid is progressing studies looking at the costs and benefits of additional interconnection to the UK and also potentially directly to continental Europe as well as general offshore grid development issues.  My Department, together with the Energy Departments in Scotland and Northern Ireland, is currently undertaking an EU INTERREG funded study into an offshore grid connection between the three jurisdictions, which would be designed to facilitate potential offshore renewable projects as opposed to being a traditional interconnector, which would be designed to run in the shortest route from one location to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Within the last 12 months, the British Irish Council commenced an energy work programme which is looking at the potential to develop grid interconnections between the Member administrations and potentially between the member administrations and continental Europe.  This work is also looking at the additional market facilitation issues necessary to encourage renewable trade between the administrations.  This will also help develop a common regional position for grid development in a European context to ensure that grid developments in Irish waters are fully reflected in EU grid planning and funding support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">Ireland is a supportive member of the North Seas offshore wind initiative comprising 9 Member States and Norway.  The countries have established a common forum to analyse and address the necessary market and infrastructure developments to facilitate greater offshore connection in the North Sea and Irish Sea areas.  The work of the forum, which is working closely with the Commission, will underpin an action plan for agreement by the 10 Energy Ministers concerned before the end of the year.  I believe the development of this new integrated grid gives us the potential to realise the value of our natural renewable resources and I am committed to working with my European colleagues to try and make it a reality.</p>

            <p eId="para_1037">There has been significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband quality over recent years.  According to ComReg's latest Quarterly Report for Q4/2009, 68% of residential subscriptions in Ireland and 75% of non-residential subscriptions are in the 2-10 Mbps range.  Only 19% of the non residential subscriptions and only 25% of the residential subscriptions are in the 1–2 Mbps range.  Higher speeds, in some cases up to 50Mbps are also available to residential and SME customers in urban areas.  Speeds of up to 24Mbps are becoming more generally available from DSL providers and 30Mbps products are available from the main cable operator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for electronic communications service providers who operate in a fully liberalised market.  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where appropriate and possible.

It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be isolated incidents of premises outside areas covered by the NBS scheme that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight, etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives and given State Aid approval to a rural broadband scheme.

The provision of mobile phone networks and services is a liberalised service.  ComReg issues licences to mobile phone operators and monitors compliance.  ComReg informs me that all the mobile phone operators exceed their licence requirements in respect of coverage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">Since the mid-1990s fossil fuel import dependency has grown significantly, due to the overall increase in energy use together with the decline in indigenous natural gas production at Kinsale since 1995 and decreasing peat production.  Over the period 1990 to 2008, production of indigenous gas decreased by 81%, and peat by 54%, while the use of renewable energy in contrast increased by 221%.</p>

        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         the recommendation that has been implemented from the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan published in 2009; the position regarding the target of 20% energy efficiency savings across the economy by 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_491">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1053">The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets of 20% across the economy and 33% in the public sector.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  There is a requirement in the Energy Services Directive that all Member States must submit their second NEEAPs in 2011 and progress on savings made will be reported then. The key NEEAP actions undertaken to date are as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), was launched in March 2009.  The scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.  In the first 12 months, 61,000 homeowners have applied for grants and to date some 30,000 homeowners have had their work completed and have received grants for almost 60,000 energy efficiency measures.  Over 5,600 construction workers have registered to take part in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) provides support for low income housing for insulation and other energy efficiency improvement measures.  This scheme is also managed by SEAI and implemented by local community groups.  Measures include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost to the householder.  Advice is also provided on minimising energy use.  Some €20 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, which included a contribution of €5 million from ESB and BGE.  This enabled energy efficiency improvements to be made in over 19,000 vulnerable homes in 2009, effectively doubling the total number of homes benefiting under the scheme in the previous ten years.  Although the scheme is primarily delivered by community-based organisations, it is estimated that over 700 jobs were directly supported by the WHS in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Funding in 2010 of €90m has been allocated to SEAI for the further expansion of its domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency schemes.  A further €40m has been allocated to improving energy efficiency of social housing across the country.  This unprecedented level of funding will, this year alone, support energy efficiency improvements in over 60,000 homes and buildings,<b> </b>support 5,000 jobs and create energy efficiency savings worth a total of €400 million over their lifetime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">In tandem with the increased level of activity in existing programmes in 2010, my Department and SEAI are finalising detailed proposals for a new retrofit programme announced on Budget Day.  In broad terms the programme will bring together the HES and the WHS as well as support programmes for businesses and the public sector for the implementation of the retrofit programme.  I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly.  It is the case that pending the finalisation and introduction of the retrofit programme, the HES and the WHS remain fully open for business in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">In the business sector, the most significant cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance requirements of new non-residential buildings, improvement of existing buildings, encouraging more businesses and public bodies to actively address their energy use and to use the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment.  In 2009, SEAI delivered a €5 million programme that provided grant assistance to the business and public sectors.  The programme supports energy efficiency measures for businesses and institutions across the country.  Over 74 projects have been funded under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual energy savings worth €2.6 million and 12kt CO<sub>2</sub> were achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">SEAI also ran a €1.3m support programme providing energy assessments and training to local authorities and other public sector agencies.  This has resulted in savings worth between €1.2m and €1.8m in 2009.  A range of best practice guides were also developed and an energy efficiency design process initiated to incorporate energy efficiency principles into the design of new or retrofitted public sector services.  Regulations introduced in December 2009 require all public bodies to include, in its annual reports published after January 1st next year, a statement describing the actions it is taking to improve its energy efficiency, together with an assessment of the energy savings arising from those actions.  SEAI is currently finalising the methodology for calculating energy savings across the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">The Energy Efficiency in the Public Sector Programme will be the main delivery mechanism for energy efficiency actions by public sector bodies.  In addition to the services provided in 2009, areas to be supported in 2010 include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">Developing Energy Service Company (ESCo) led models;</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">Assisting public sector bodies in the development of 2020 energy efficiency strategies;</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">Working in partnership with all Departments in relation to energy efficient design and procurement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">Regulations are also in place give effect to the EU Energy Efficiency Directive that include new energy efficient public procurement rules.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEAI's database of highly energy efficient products.  This database has already been developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) Scheme for energy efficient technologies.  SEAI is also required under the regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the National Procurement Service and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">A key announcement in Budget 2010 was the decision to extend the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme.  The Scheme has now been expanded to encompass additional categories including IT software solutions, refrigeration and cooling systems, electro-mechanical systems and catering and hospitality equipment, and covers up to 40 categories of technology.  Companies can write off the full capital cost of registered energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase, unlike non-ACA equipment which is typically written off over eight years.  The ACA scheme now covers equipment accounting for at least 80% of the energy use in industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">In compliance with the 2006 and 2008 Building Regulations, it is the policy of Office of Public Works (OPW) to conduct feasibility studies on the utilisation of renewable energy technologies in all new buildings over 1,000m<sup>2</sup> as part of the design process.  The OPW has already installed a number of biomass boiler systems and Solar Panel systems in both new and existing buildings where it has been shown to be both technically and economically feasible.  OPW will continue to take this approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently prioritised work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board to establish achievable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for buildings in all sectors of the economy including public sector buildings, with a view to upgrading the requirements in Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations in 2010.  The work programme currently under way will inform the development of a programme for continuous improvement in Part L requirements in coming years with a view to achieving a Carbon Neutral building standard for buildings other than dwellings, including civic buildings, by 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">SEAI's Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) continues to engage with the largest energy using enterprises (in manufacturing and services) where the 120 member companies collectively spend over €800 million per annum on energy.  Recently published analysis shows that by spending €1.9 million these companies avoided energy costs of €60 million in 2008 alone.</p>

            <p eId="para_1071">I have stated on a number of occasions commitment to the early provision of a legislative framework for the exploration for and development of geothermal energy.  Accordingly, in the course of 2009, drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill with a view to producing Heads in early 2010 was prioritised in the Department, with detailed legislative drafting to follow by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard and I am currently considering an initial proposal for Heads of the Bill.  My aim is to have technical legal drafting completed in time to have a publication of a Bill later this year and I will be bringing proposals to Government for this purpose as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">As I have previously stated, geothermal energy is a new area of legislative endeavour in this jurisdiction and so the Bill will be substantial, dealing with a range of matters such as ownership of the resource, regulation and licensing of exploration and development, ancillary rights and protection of third party interests.  I would add that I have engaged closely with industry and interested parties in a public consultation process and in a series of meetings and workshops to ensure that the legislative proposals have the benefit of their input.</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">Service providers are deemed as "customers" of the MANs.  In other words, a service provider, as a customer of a MAN, uses the MAN to offer services on to the service provider's own customers.  35 service providers are currently offering services on the Phase I MANs and 6 service providers are currently offering services on the Phase II MANs.  Service providers use the MANs to provide voice and data services to their own customers over a range of platforms including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Unbundled local loop;</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Mobile wireless;</p>

            <p eId="para_1079">Partial private circuits; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Directly connected fibre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Information relating to the use of the MANs by service providers, including the numbers of customers served by each service provider, is commercially sensitive and a matter for e|net, the Management Services Entity and for each service provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">Customer connection costs depend on a number of factors including the distance a customer is from the existing MAN infrastructure, the presence of existing ducting and the surface type that has to be constructed.  Currently the average cost of each connection is between €8,000 and €9,000 which reflects the high cost of any civil construction work carried out in an urban area.  Levels of usage on the MANs vary between towns.  Whilst take-up by service providers of the Phase I MANs was slow in the initial stages there has been significant improvement in this regard over the past five years. An analysis carried out by e|net recently showed an estimated 570,000 people relied on the MANs' services for some form of communications services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The IDA believe that the MANs have provided inward investors with much greater choice, service and pricing when it comes to broadband connectivity. The MANs have also contributed significantly to the competitiveness of regional centres in Ireland and their attractiveness to foreign direct investment.  While recognising that difficulties remain on backhaul and last mile connections, I believe that the MANs will provide real long term benefits for our national broadband infrastructure and that use of the MANs will continue to evolve in a manner which is of increasing benefit to service providers and end users.</p>

            <p eId="para_1085">The OECD report is one in a series of periodic reports on electronic communications markets.  The broadband market is a fast moving one and international tables do not always capture the full extent of market developments.  At the end of 2009, Ireland's broadband per capita penetration rate stood at 32.4% with mobile broadband included, significantly ahead of the June 2009 OECD average of 22.8%.  Our penetration rate, excluding mobile, was 21.9% at the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">It is noteworthy that Ireland continued to be one of the leading countries in terms of year on year broadband growth in the OECD, adding 2.64 subscribers (per 100 of population) while the OECD average stood at only 1.72 subscribers.  With mobile broadband included, our year on year per capita penetration rate grew by 5.3 subscribers, from 27.1% in Q4 2008 to 32.4% at the end of 2009.  It is also notable that ComReg's quarterly report for Q3/2009 calculated that when fixed and mobile broadband penetration rates were combined, Ireland ranked 11th out of the EU27 countries (note: no mobile broadband figure was represented for Finland); 14th among fixed broadband penetration rates only and 4th among mobile broadband penetration rates only.  However, as set out in the Government's broadband policy document, my ambition is to improve that position so that we match the leading European countries and regions in broadband accessibility.</p>

In the subsequent six months, since the Programme signalled that a PAYS model would be considered, the number of applications has increased to almost 27,000 — a total of 50,000 in 12 months.

            <p eId="para_1093">The National Biofuel Obligation will underpin delivery of the national biofuel target and will take full account of EU biofuels policy, including the sustainability criteria.  The legislative basis for the obligation is provided for in the Energy (Biofuels Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently under consideration in the Oireachtas.  Prior to the introduction of the Excise Relief schemes in 2005, market penetration of biofuels in Ireland was almost non existent.  While final figures for 2009 are not yet available penetration is expected to be in the region of 2.5%.</p>

As at the end January 2010, under the MOTR Schemes of the excise relief claimed, 49% was for imported biofuel and 25% related to feedstock imports.  These imports were from the EU (UK, France, Germany, Holland) and South America.  The National Biofuel Obligation will also integrate the EU Sustainability Criteria, the implementation details of which have yet to be finalised by the European Commission.  The objective is to ensure that all biofuels counted towards the national obligation are fully sustainable in line with EU legal requirements.  The EU sustainability criteria will be the first internationally agreed set of rules governing the origins of biofuels.  The EU sustainability criteria will provide competitive advantage for Irish and other EU producers by ensuring that non EU imports meet strict environmental guidelines.</p>

The context of the meetings was the Report of the Panel set up by the Government last year to report on the adequacy of the statements of resources to be submitted by the congregations to the Panel as a basis for assessing the responses to be made by the congregations to the call made to them last year by the Dáil and the Government for additional contributions by way of reparation for the abuse suffered by children in residential institutions.  The Government published the Panel Report and the congregations' responses later on 15 April, along with a statement on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">The position of women who had been in Magdalene Laundries was raised by representatives of some victims' groups.  While the matter was outside the focus of the meeting, the Government side indicated in response that the position of women in such laundries was not analogous with that of children in the residential institutions that were the subject of the Ryan Report. It was noted that the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children had each already held meetings with Magdalene women and their representatives and I made it clear that those Departments would be ready to help them with further enquiries as far as possible.  The Government is also conscious that the Magdalene laundries were run by a small number of religious congregations with whom it is understood Magdalene women and their representatives are in contact; it is also understood that they are in contact with the person referred to by the Deputy.</p>

They are, rather, exhibitions with a broad scope and a particular focus on the cultural dimension. Consequently they appeal to a more general audience.

They provide both a formal and structured input as well as a drop-in resource facility.  They also help the individual in overcoming the personal effects of unemployment by providing a mutual support forum from people in a similar situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">I am advised that there is one formal Job Club in each of the counties Sligo, Kilkenny and Carlow.  The following table contains details of the number of clients dealt with in each of these Jobs Clubs on a one-to-one basis in 2006, 2007 and 2008:</p>

I can confirm that my Department received a redundancy rebate claim from the employer concerned on 24 April, 2009.   In the course of processing the claim, a number of queries were raised with the employer.  I understand that my Department has recently been in contact with the employer on an outstanding matter.  The claim will be processed for payment as soon as the outstanding query is resolved.</p>

Some 350 tenders were received by the deadline of close of business on Thursday 8th April. An Evaluation Committee established by the Department is currently assessing the tenders, and, given the significant volume of work involved, is expected to conclude its work by the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The Evaluation Committee will make recommendations to my Department on contract awards based on assessment of the tenders having regard to the criteria set out in the Request for Tender. These criteria are: Assessment of Needs; Management, Capacity and Resources; Programme Methodology and Tuition Standards; Participant Progression; Innovation; and Programme Costs. It is intended that the process of awarding contracts to successful providers will begin in May. A preliminary review of the tenders has shown wide-ranging interest in the Fund with proposals being submitted by organisations in the private and public sectors and from voluntary and not-for-profit organisations, covering most regions in the country. This level of interest is very encouraging.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_509">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1263">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 26 November 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  This claim awaits processing. In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">almost<b>doubling the number of staff</b> through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">prioritisation of the Department's<b>overtime budget</b> towards staff in the both Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">establishment of a<b>special call handling facility</b> in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the<b>offset of redundancy rebate payments</b> by employers against outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  The number of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 50,664, an increase of 70% over 2008.  In the first quarter of 2010, my Department processed 21,122 claims — an increase of over 151% on the previous first quarter in 2009.  Claims processed in the month of March 2010 was the highest ever achieved in the Section with 8,168 claims processed in the month.  In the year to date, inroads have being made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end January 2010 to 37,054 at the end of March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">Responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_1274">The recently launched IDA strategy, entitled <i>“Horizon 2020</i>”  sets the following high level goals for the five year  period 2010 to 2014:</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">Create 62,000 new jobs in direct employment with a further 43,000 jobs in indirect employment, a total of 105,000 jobs;</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">640 Investments;</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">50% of FDI projects outside of Dublin and Cork;</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">20% of greenfield investments from emerging high-growth markets;</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">€1.7 billion investment in RD&amp;I per annum by client companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) aims to achieve a balance of social and economic development across the country and IDA strategy for the regions is closely aligned to the NSS and the gateway and hub locations.  However, the challenge in achieving an even spread of investment across the country is intensified as the sophistication of investments increase.  These investments require a concentration of highly qualified and educated workers, supporting infrastructure and high level business services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">Already the Midlands region is home to a high concentration of Medical Device industries, and has become a winning location for a vibrant and sustainable Life Sciences environment.   There are 44 IDA supported companies employing 4,542 people in the Midlands Region.  IDA's Medical Technologies department is based in the Midlands and is well positioned to facilitate collaborations between existing client companies and local indigenous companies to enhance the growing cluster while embracing new technologies and processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">As well as marketing the Midlands Region for new Greenfield investment, IDA continues to work with existing clients to broaden their mandate in Ireland and to continue to re-invest in their sites within the Region.  IDA Ireland strongly encourages client companies to invest in Research and Development and provides a comprehensive R&amp;D package to support this activity.  The Athlone Institute of Technology (AIT) has introduced and developed programmes in line with changing regional, national and international needs. The emphasis which the Institute has placed on research activities and liaison with industrial and commercial organisations has helped to ensure the relevance and technological competence of courses at the institute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The completion of the M6 motorway from Dublin to Galway offers significant benefits to the Midlands with accessibility to larger urban centres, transport links and the ability to attract a large talent pool being critical deciding factors for many FDI clients.  This has facilitated the emergence of a new medical technology cluster closely aligned with the Galway cluster.  Frequently, competition for Foreign Direct Investment is not between countries but between city regions with populations in excess of one million people. Dublin is the only recognised city region in Ireland that meets these criteria.  If FDI is to continue to contribute to balanced regional development, the other regions of the country must be developed and promoted as regions of scale with urban centres that provide the range of infrastructure and services that high value investment projects demand.  The development of the Midlands Gateway is intended to be helpful to the Midlands region in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1285">It is difficult to answer the Deputy's question except in the most general terms to say that there are safeguards built into various pieces of legislation to guard against abuse of the employer-employee relationship, particularly when dealing with matters relating to the termination of that relationship e.g. unfair dismissal. Ultimately, each case will hinge on its facts, as interpreted and ruled upon by various elements of the State's dispute resolution machinery e.g. Rights Commissioners and/or Employment Appeals Tribunal and, if necessary, the Law Courts.  The following information relating to the type of issues that can arise in such cases may be of some assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">Lay off</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">A lay-off situation exists when an employer suspends an employee's employment because there is no work available, when the employer expects the cessation of work to be temporary and when the employer notifies the employee to this effect. For a lay-off situation to apply the period of lay-off must be genuinely of a temporary nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">Redundancy</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">In general, redundancy is a situation where an employee's job has been made redundant and the employee is not replaced. A key issue in respect of selection for redundancy is that the selection process must be seen to be fair and non discriminatory. Should an individual feel that they have been unfairly dismissed by reason of unfair selection for redundancy, it is open to that individual to take a case to the Rights Commissioners or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Collective Redundancy</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The issue of collective redundancies is governed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007. Collective Redundancy is the making redundant within a period of 30 consecutive days, of a minimum number of employees. That minimum varies with the size of the workforce. The relevant minimum number of proposed redundancies, <i>vis-à-vis </i> the size of the overall workforce, is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">5 employees in an establishment employing 21-49 employees;</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">10 employees in an establishment normally employing 50-99 employees;</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">10% of employees in an establishment normally employing 100-299 employees or;</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">30 employees in an establishment normally employing 300 or more employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">There must be a minimum of 20 employees before there can be a collective redundancy situation. The number of employees normally employed in an establishment is taken to be the average of the number so employed in each of the 12 months preceding the date on which the first dismissal takes place. Where companies are being closed down following bankruptcy, winding-up proceedings or an unsuccessful examiner ship there will not be a collective redundancy situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">Companies proposing collective redundancies must provide certain information to employee representatives regarding the proposed collective redundancy. They must enter into consultation with the employee representatives at least 30 days before anyone receives notice of redundancy. Companies must also notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the proposed redundancies at least 30 days before any employee receives notice of redundancy. The consultation with the employee representatives and the notification period for the Minister can run concurrently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">Exceptional Collective Redundancy</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">Exceptional Collective Redundancy is defined under Section 16 of the Act. Essentially, to be considered an exceptional collective redundancy situation under the Act, the proposal must involve a compulsory collective redundancy proposal with the planned replacement of staff by:</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">Direct employees employed by the employer;</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The use of other replacement workers by the aforementioned employer in the same location or elsewhere in the jurisdiction;</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">On materially inferior Terms and Conditions, and with the new workers performing essentially the same functions as those to be made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2007 generally apply to any employee who has 12 months continuous service with the employer. In the case of a complaint referred to a Rights Commissioner, the employer may object and in that event the matter will be heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">Unfair Dismissal</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">The Unfair Dismissals Acts provide that the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Acts, not to be an unfair dismissal, if it results wholly or mainly from one or more of the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">the capability, competence or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind which he/she was employed to do;</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">the conduct of the employee (in which case the issue of disciplinary procedures may be important);</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">the redundancy of the employee's job.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">In determining for the purposes of the Acts whether the dismissal of an employee was an unfair dismissal or not, it shall be for the employer to show that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters specified above or that there were other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">If the employees have any further queries, they may contact the National EmploymentRights Authority (NERA) on its Lo-call number 1890 80 80 90 or via its website at <i>www.employmentrights.ie</i>

The number of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 50,664, an increase of 70% over 2008.  In the first quarter of 2010, my Department processed 21,122 claims — an increase of over 151% on the previous first quarter in 2009.  Claims processed in the month of March 2010 was the highest ever achieved in the Section with 8,168 claims processed in the month.  In the year to date, inroads have being made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end January 2010 to 37,054 at the end of March 2010.</p>

The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

The purpose of this examination is to assess the contribution such a scheme might make to alleviating difficulties being experienced by companies, particularly by SMEs, in accessing finance in the context of the range of measures already taken by the Government for this purpose.  Key concerns being addressed include the extent to which such a scheme would increase lending to SMEs (as against enhancing security for the banks) and the extent of taxpayer exposure.

            <p eId="para_1400">I announced in the Budget that a carbon tax at a rate €15 per tonne would be introduced on fossil fuels. It should be noted that a carbon tax came into effect on 10 December 2009 in respect of petrol and auto-diesel and will apply from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as "green diesel" or "agricultural diesel"), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">It is estimated that the carbon tax, inclusive of VAT, will yield approximately €250 million in 2010. The revenue will, amongst other things, be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty.  The impact on individual fuels in terms of nominal and percentage price changes is illustrated below:</p>

Information on the debt issuance by institutions under the Eligible Liability Guarantee Scheme is also available on the NTMA website (www.ntma.ie).  Details of the amounts guaranteed under the schemes are not published because of the commercial sensitivity of such information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">Detailed information on bondholders of domestic credit institutions' senior and subordinated debt is not available. Credit institutions, including Anglo Irish Bank, do not have access to comprehensive information on the holders of their senior and junior, or subordinated, debt, because such debt is publicly traded and dealt through clearing house systems. Issuers do not have access to the records of those systems and the issuer has no means of establishing the underlying ownership of its bonds at any given time. Unlike in the case of shares, the holders of credit institutions' senior and subordinated debt instruments are not subject to a disclosure regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">As I indicated in my Banks Statement on the 30 March last I will be seeking the Commission's agreement for a modified extension of the current ELG Scheme consistent with a phasing out over a realistic period of time. The scheme is due to be reviewed by the Commission before 1 June 2010 and I intend to make an announcement about the future of the guarantee in advance of that date.  I want to stress that, of course the ordinary Deposit Guarantee Scheme that covers €100,000 per depositor per institution is in place and will continue on a permanent basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1461">The statutory origin of the relationship framework, signed on 8 July 2009, between the Minister and Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited lies in Section 3 of the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009. In the interests of facilitating compliance with EU State aid and competition policy, the Relationship Framework recognises the separation of Anglo Irish Bank from the Minister and limits intervention by the Minister in the conduct of Anglo Irish Bank's day to day commercial activities. The Relationship Framework may be amended by the Minister as he sees fit, subject to EU consent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">The Relationship Framework is concerned centrally with the alignment of the activities of Anglo Irish Bank with key ministerial objectives which seek to protect the public interest. There is no conflict between the express ministerial objectives, to preserve the capacity of Anglo Irish Bank to continue its operations as a going concern and progressively enhance its financial position and viability to an extent where it can operate without support from the State and to minimise cost and other risk to the public, both of which form but part of a series of key objectives which seek to serve and promote the public interest. Both of the key objectives identified mutually inform one another and serve the protection of the public interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">As I have outlined on previous occasions, the consequences of an immediate winding up of Anglo Irish Bank would be very severe. It is estimated that to wind up Anglo Irish Bank would lead to a fire-sale of assets resulting in a permanent additional and unnecessary loss of upwards of €30 billion. In addition, the State would have to provide in the order of €70 billion up-front to meet deposits, bondholders and the liabilities due to the Eurosystem.  A revised restructuring plan for Anglo Irish Bank is being prepared for submission to the EU Commission under State aid rules. This will explore all options for the future of the bank and it is my main concern to ensure that the  interests of the taxpayer are paramount in the plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_1468">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 143 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 92B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for an exemption from Stamp Duty where a house is purchased by a first time buyer.  A person will not qualify for the exemption if he or she has previously purchased a house either within or outside of Ireland.  From the details supplied by Deputy Upton, while the person has not previously purchased a house in Ireland, the person did previously purchase a house outside of Ireland.  In these circumstances the person is not entitled to avail of the first time buyer exemption in relation to a subsequent purchase of a house in Ireland.  However, the person may be entitled to avail of an exemption or relief from Stamp Duty if the house being purchased is newly built.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">Section 91A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for an exemption from Stamp Duty where a new house, with a floor area not exceeding 125 square metres, is purchased by a non-first time buyer for occupation as his/her principal place of residence.  Section 92 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for a relief from Stamp Duty where a new house, with a floor area exceeding 125 square metres, is purchased by a non-first time buyer for occupation as his/her principal place of residence.  Where this relief applies, Stamp Duty is chargeable, at the residential property rates, on the greater of (a) the consideration paid for the site or (b) 25% of the aggregate of the consideration paid for the site and the building costs.  The residential property rates of Stamp Duty are set out in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">The concerns outlined in the correspondence enclosed by the Deputy refer to the need to update legislation governing the operation and regulation of credit unions in Ireland and to the proposal to amend Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 which imposes limits on credit unions in relation to longer-term lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">With reference to credit union legislation,<b> </b>I agree that the current legislative framework needs reform.  Accordingly, I have requested the Financial Regulator to initiate a strategic review of the credit union sector in Ireland.  This project, which is already underway, will involve an examination of the structure, operation, regulation and legislation of the credit union sector.  It will provide a report making recommendations, including specific proposals to strengthen prudential soundness, which will advise and inform an assessment of the future strategic direction of credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">The restrictions contained in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 are an important asset and liability instrument protecting the financial stability of the credit union movement over many years.  The need for such a mechanism will be addressed in the strategic review but in the immediate future it is necessary to address ongoing issues with regard to Section 35 now.  The matter was considered by my Department following consultation with the two Credit Union representative bodies — the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Development Association — and with the Registrar of Credit Unions, and a provision has been included in the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010, which is receiving its second stage reading in Dáil Éireann at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1489">Farmers who are not registered for VAT are not in the normal course entitled to credit for, or repayment of, VAT incurred by them on their business inputs.  The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 25) Order, 1993 provides for refunds to unregistered farmers for tax borne on the "construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure which is designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  However, while the installation of an alternative energy generator, such as a wind turbine, may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not "designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required.  Consequently, the installation of a wind turbine does not come within the scope of the VAT refund order.</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">I announced in the Budget that a carbon tax at a rate of €15 per tonne is being introduced on fossil fuels.

The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order. This is to allow time for issues such as fuel poverty and the sourcing of coal of a lower environmental standard from Northern Ireland to be addressed.</p>

The Department of Environment, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have recently met with the Solid Fuel Trade Group in this regard.</p>

These applications are currently being assessed, in conjunction with the Council, and a decision will be made shortly in respect of these.  The total estimated cost of the proposed works and studies in Leitrim in 2010 is €1.7m.  The total estimated cost of applications for funding received to date from all Local Authorities for works and studies under the scheme in 2010 is €25,240,671.

            <p eId="para_1516">I refer to the responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 73 and 146 on 22nd April 2010.  My Department made an application to the EU Commission on 27th January 2010 for funding under the EU Solidarity Fund based on estimates of damage received from Departments and local authorities.  The application was formally acknowledged by the Commission on 24th February 2010.  The EU Solidarity Fund does not fund full reconstruction nor does it fund prevention works.  It funds emergency operations to allow a rapid return to normal living conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund's threshold of 0.6% of GNI or 935.5m euro for a national disaster.  There are specific criteria which must be met to ensure a successful regional application to the EU Solidarity Fund.  These criteria include the majority of the population of the region being affected by the disaster and serious and long lasting effects on the region's economic stability and living conditions.  My Department continues to work with the Commission on finalising the costs underpinning the application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1519">The particular institutions referred to by the Deputy in his question are subject to regulation, in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, by the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator's principal responsibility involves the ongoing monitoring of financial institutions in order to ensure their solvency and compliance with all other regulatory requirements on an individual basis.  Any complaints related to solvency, regulation generally, corporate governance and compliance with company law would, therefore, be the responsibility of the Financial Regulator.  With regard to unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial service providers, statutory responsibility for dealing with such complaints rests with the Financial Services Ombudsman under the terms of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">While a wide variety of matters may be brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance over a period of time, these are where appropriate referred for the attention of the relevant body.  It is essential that both the regulatory process and the system for resolving the complaints of individual consumers against financial institutions should be wholly independent from the political process and determined by the relevant statutory authorities having regard to the merits of the individual case.  The current legislative framework guarantees the independence of each of those functions.  This independence will also be fully protected in the legislation which will reform the current structure of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The Deputy will be aware that both the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman produce annual reports which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1531">In the light of the health risks associated with some of the products being sold in so-called "head shops", the Government has agreed to the introduction of regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 which will introduce controls on a range of substances which are currently on sale in head shops.  The substances concerned include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">synthetic cannabinoids (SPICE products);</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">benzylpiperazine (BZP) derivatives;</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">mephedrone, methylone and related cathinones;</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA);</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">GBL and 1,4 BD.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">In accordance with EU law, it is necessary to notify the European Commission of the proposed regulations and this imposes a 3 month stand-still period on the making of the regulations.  The regulations were notified in early April and allowing for the stand-still period will be implemented at end June/early July.  Following the introduction of the regulations, the possession and sale of these substances, other than GBL and 1,4BD, will be illegal and subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Act while the possession and sale of the latter substances will be confined to use in legitimate industrial processes only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">With regard to the suggestion that all substances sold in Headshops should be deemed to be illegal until they have been assessed by the authorities, this is not possible under current legislation.  However, my colleagues the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are urgently examining a range of possible approaches to the regulation of head shops.  This may involve making it a criminal offence to supply unregulated psychotropic substances.</p>

         the success to date of the new fair deal arrangement in freeing up beds of persons whose discharge was delayed due to the lack of an appropriate placement for them; her views on the concern that many private nursing homes do not wish to take patients with high care needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_1557">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is now the single system of financial support for people in need of long-term nursing home care from 27 October 2009.  The scheme encompasses a care needs assessment which considers whether the person has sufficiently high care needs to warrant nursing home care or whether their care needs can be met in the community.  A person <i>must</i> be assessed as needing long-term nursing home care in order to qualify for financial support.  Therefore, the new funding arrangements encompassed within the Scheme should incentivise private nursing home providers to accept residents with high care needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme also contains a commitment to patient choice.  A person wishing to avail of the scheme may choose any public or approved private nursing home subject to the availability of a place and the suitability of the home to meet the person's care needs.  With regard to the issue of suitability, the responsibility rests with the particular nursing home provider to ensure that they can meet the prospective resident's care needs.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">The Health Act, 2007 provides for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes.  Standards are a key requirement for registration and inspection of nursing homes and National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland are underpinned by the<b> </b>Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009.   The standards acknowledge the unique and complex needs of the individual person at the centre of care, and require service providers to deliver a person-centred and comprehensive service that promotes health, well-being and quality of life. If the nursing home is not in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">In addition, when applying for registration the registered provider must provide a statement of purpose for the designated centre.  The statement will include details of the facilities and services which are to be provided, the maximum number of residents that can be accommodated at the centre and the range of needs that the centre is intended to meet.  The staffing requirements of each nursing home will differ depending on its configuration, occupancy and dependency levels.  As part of the Registration process each designated centred is inspected.  Based on the range of services provided and the assessed needs of the residents, inspectors determine whether the nursing home complies with both the Standards and Care and Welfare Regulations and may set conditions concerning the type of service that can be provided at the home.  As the Standards provide that "<i>each resident has his/her needs assessed prior to moving into the home</i>”, it is a matter for the registered provider to determine whether the home can provide the services that will meet the assessed needs of prospective residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question concerning delayed discharges, I wish to advise that due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive it is not possible for the Executive to supply the information requested.  If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_1612">The Health Service Executive confirmed in June 2009 that a total of fifteen laptops had been stolen from the HSE Community Care Office in Roscommon. Of the fifteen laptops stolen, thirteen were encrypted while the other two were password protected, but not encrypted. The HSE confirmed at the time that it was satisfied that there was no identifying information in relation to patients or clients on one of the unencrypted laptops, while the other contained information relating to a social worker's case notes involving nine families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">The HSE further confirmed at the time that it fully recognises the obligation it has in relation to the personal and sensitive information that it holds and is fully committed to ensuring its protection. The HSE has a comprehensive set of information security policies in place which are based on respecting and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information it holds at all times. These policies cover electronic communications, acceptable use of information and communications technology, password standards, encryption and security of mobile devices. The policies apply to all information held by the HSE, all ICT technology resources and all users of HSE information. Following the theft of laptops in Roscommon, the HSE further updated its security procedures to ensure that all laptops are encrypted prior to being issued to staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">The break in at the Roscommon premises was reported to Gardaí immediately following its discovery.

If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">The Information and Tracing Unit in the Adoption Board provides an advice and referral service for those seeking to trace or to obtain medical or personal information. This unit provides services directly to adoptees, natural mothers and birth families.  It also works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE nationwide information and tracing services.  Improvements to this service have been effected by the computerisation of the unique adoption files held by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  Already 440 matches have been made on the Register representing over 900 individuals who have now received a service.  The operation of the Register was reviewed in 2007 and a major upgrading of it has just been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">The Adoption Board, together with the societies, the HSE and the support groups, developed the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service".  This was published in November 2007 and sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally. The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally. In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, the Adoption Board intends to undertake a consultation process with interested parties to determine how best to address the needs of those adopted from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">Registration of domestic adoptions is governed by Section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952.  Under that provision, an tÁrd Chláraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. I am aware that the treatment of adopted persons in this regard differs from the rest of the population but consideration of this issue must take place in the context of the complex legal, ethical and constitutional issues arising from the need to fairly balance the rights of all parties to the adoption process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1664">Under the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), there are four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres. The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate. University Hospital Galway (UHG) and the Midwestern Regional Hospital, Limerick, are the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE West.  Initial breast cancer diagnostic and surgical services for the HSE West region are now provided at these two centres or at Letterkenny General Hospital under an outreach service provided from UHG in conjunction with staff at Letterkenny.  Breast reconstruction surgery is not provided at Letterkenny. Women in the area requiring breast reconstruction undergo this surgery at UHG.</p>

However, I can state that area of residence has no impact on access to breast reconstruction surgical services at Galway.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund arranges treatment for patients who have been on a surgical waiting list, including breast reconstruction, for more than three months.  It is open to such patients or anyone acting on their behalf to contact the NTPF directly in relation to their case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1694">I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January this year.  In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 257 on 20 April 2010 I stated that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years and 6 months and 5 years and 6 months. It is accepted that some parents choose to send their children to primary school at an earlier age and the ECCE scheme allows for children to attend the pre-school year and still commence primary school when they are just over 4 years and 2 months of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The ECCE scheme takes cognisance of the variation in school admission policies in regard to the age at which children may enter primary school.  As a result, the qualifying age range extends to nearly a 17 month period i.e. children eligible for admission this January were born between 2 February 2005 and 30 June 2006.  Provision is also made for children to qualify at a later age if this is necessary to meet a particularly high age requirement in local primary schools or if they have special needs which make enrolment at a later age more appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">It is necessary to the objectives of the ECCE scheme that appropriate age-related early learning activities are provided to children in their pre-school year.  The scheme must remain sufficiently targeted to ensure the best delivery of pre-school education and, therefore, it is not proposed to extend the eligibility age range beyond that currently provided for.</p>

            <p eId="para_1698">Officials from my Department and the Irish Aviation Authority met representatives from the four main Irish air airlines on the morning of Wednesday 21 April to discuss the response to the recent severe disruption of air services.  The cooperation of the airlines with the IAA and European regulatory authorities during the crisis was acknowledged.  It was noted that the IAA and their UK counterparts had sanctioned the resumption of full services on a phased basis in all Irish and UK airspace to Europe, North America and the UK from 9pm the previous evening, Tuesday 20th April.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">The airlines indicated that it would take a number of days before full services could resume.  They indicated that the priority that day was the re-positioning of aircraft and crews but advised that passengers would be kept informed of revised flight arrangements through the normal information channels and that additional services would be made available on a number of routes in an effort to clear the backlog of disrupted passengers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">With regard to passenger rights, the Department reminded the airlines of their obligations under Regulation (EC) 261/2004.  In was noted that the exemption provisions for "extraordinary circumstances" applies only to the compensation provisions of the Regulation.  Airlines still have a duty to provide appropriate care and assistance for passengers, as specified in the Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">I have not received any requests for State aid arising from the closure of airspace.  EU Transport Ministers held a meeting by video/audio conference on Monday 19th April to discuss the airspace closure.  On the basis of a recommendation agreed unanimously by the national authorities of the 38 Members of Eurocontrol, Ministers agreed to intensify European co-ordination and risk assessment of airspace management resulting in the introduction of new measures with effect from Tuesday 20th April based on the designation of zones based on ash concentration levels which would allow for the progressive and co-ordinated opening of European Airspace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The Irish Aviation Authority, in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Authority of the UK, sanctioned the resumption of full service on a phased basis in all Irish and UK airspace from 9 p.m. on Tuesday 20th April, following the EU Transport Ministers meeting and further assessment of the impacts, including discussions with aircraft engine manufacturers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1710">As the Deputy will be aware the Preclearance facilities at Shannon Airport became operational for commercial aircraft on 5 August 2009 and for private aircraft on 1 March this year. I understand from the Shannon Airport Authority (SAA) that airline and passenger feedback of the facility to date has been very positive.  When it was brought to my attention that there was a difficulty with the type of private aircraft that could avail of the preclearance facility my officials contacted the US authorities and I wrote to Ms. Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seeking her assistance in resolving the matter.  I am fully aware of the critical importance that aviation preclearance has for Shannon Airport and will continue to support the Airport Authority in helping to resolve this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1712">The recent closure of most of European airspace arising from the volcanic ash cloud was unprecedented.  The event has had a severe impact on passengers, airlines, airports and on the European economy more generally.  EU Transport Ministers held a meeting by video/audio conference on Monday 19th April to discuss the airspace closure.  Discussions that day focussed on safety and airspace management issues in order to achieve a progressive and co-ordinated reopening of European airspace.  The measures agreed were put into effect on Tuesday 20th April allowing for a phased resumption of services across Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">Any actions taken to deal with the impact of the crisis must be taken on a pan-European level.  To this end, the Spanish Presidency has scheduled an extraordinary meeting of Transport Ministers for 4th May to discuss areas for actions resulting from the crisis.  Among the issues that will be examined are the current European regulatory framework, the economic impact of the crisis and response to it, the application of air passenger rights and future crisis management.</p>

Regarding processing times for visa applications, in our dedicated overseas offices in some of the countries mentioned (China, Russia and India), all types of visit visa applications including holiday-type visas are processed typically in two to three weeks (often less for non-complicated applications).

The OIS is advised by an Internet Safety Advisory Council, comprised of key stakeholders in the statutory, industry and community sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">In a number of EU Member States (the UK, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands), a system of internet blocking/filtering has been introduced on a voluntary basis, whereby a "blocklist" of sites containing illegal child pornography is made available by the police or other competent authorities, and is utilised by individual Internet Service Providers to prevent access to such content. A small number of other Member States (Germany, France) have introduced or are considering the introduction of legislation requiring ISPs to block access to websites containing child pornography.  It is generally acknowledged that all such internet blocking or filtering systems are not foolproof and can be circumvented in certain circumstances. However, such filtering systems are understood to be useful in preventing internet users from inadvertently encountering such illegal content.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">Insofar as the Department of Justice is aware, standard internet service providers (ISPs) in Ireland do not currently implement any blocking/filtering system in respect of child pornography at present. This whole issue of such blocking/filtering is being considered further by the Office for Internet Safety with advice from the Internet Safety Advisory Council.  In undertaking research to develop policy advice in this area, the Office for Internet Safety has had discussions with a variety of relevant interests in relation to issues pertinent to the consideration of the possibility or feasibility of introducing internet filtering, specifically in respect of illegal child pornography content, in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">However, I should make it clear that no decisions have been arrived at national level on this issue of internet filtering/blocking of websites containing child pornography material. Any proposals for the introduction of such a system would need, at the very least, to be submitted to the Government for consideration. Indeed it is possible that the introduction of any such system, particularly if on a mandatory basis, might require the introduction of primary legislation.</p>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that an important feature of the protocol is the establishment of a Garda liaison role with the HSE care placements at a local level.  The local liaison role includes a mechanism to identify children in care who are reported missing frequently and to escalate the responsibility for them to an appropriate level of authority in both organisations.

The allocation of policing resources throughout the country, including personnel, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda Officers.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed, and this ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1805">I draw the Deputy's attention to a reply to a written Parliamentary Question No. 151 which I provided on Wednesday, 21 April 2010 and to confirm that the situation concerning this matter has not changed in the intervening days. The text of my reply to Parliamentary Question 16000/10 is attached below, for ease of reference:  "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has periodically enlarged its membership since its foundation with 20 Members, including Ireland, in 1961. It currently has 30 members, with the Slovak Republic the most recent to accede, in 2000.  In 2007, the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting decided, by consensus, to open accession discussions with Chile, Estonia, Israel, the Russian Federation and Slovenia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The OECD accession process involves submission of an initial memorandum (which sets out the country's position on more than 200 OECD legal instruments), technical accession reviews by 22 OECD committees assessing the country's compliance with the OECD <i>acquis</i> (obligations include liberalisation commitments under the OECD investment instruments, adoption of national laws which comply with the requirements of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention as well as commitments related to environmental policy), and a final decision by the Council of the OECD to invite the candidate country to accede.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">An invitation to accede to the OECD is based upon the applicant country's compliance with the Organisation's <i>acquis</i> and does not relate to or imply approval for other actions or policies of that State.  An accession agreement with Chile was signed on 11 January of this year and it will accede formally to the Organisation once ratification procedures are completed.  It is expected that Slovenia, Estonia and Israel will complete their accession procedures this year. The accession process for Russia is moving at a slower pace and there is no predicted date for completion.  In the case of Israel, on the basis of formal opinions and all other relevant technical information, the Secretary-General of the OECD has recommended to the OECD Council that Israel be invited to accede to the Organisation. It is expected that the OECD Council will address this matter over the period ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">During the Israeli accession negotiations, the EU has adopted a cohesive approach and plans to issue a common statement at the OECD Council when a decision to formally invite Israel to become a member is taken in the coming weeks. It is anticipated that the EU will note that Israel has taken a number of important steps through the adoption of new legislation, regulations and policy directions in many areas, including anti-corruption, the environment, competition and intellectual property rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">It is expected that the EU statement will also state that Israel is expected to demonstrate readiness for compliance with the recommendations made by OECD bodies in the accession process and to pursue reforms, especially in areas where implementation periods were granted or where commitments have been undertaken.  Taking all requirements of the accession process into consideration it is expected that Ireland will join with the other 29 members of the OECD to formally invite Israel to become a member. We will work with partners in ensuring that Israel fully complies with all the obligations arising from OECD membership."</p>

            <p eId="para_1815">Dr Kian Tajbakhsh is a dual US-Iranian national, arrested in July 2009. Dr. Tajbakhsh's case was heard by an appeals court on 10 February and his sentence was set at five years for a variety of charges linked to the post-election disturbances in Iran. These charges have been strenuously denied by the US government, which has called for his release.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">The latest reports from those campaigning for Dr. Tajbakhsh's release are that he was released on bail on 13 March for the Iranian New Year and allowed to return to his family. There have also been unconfirmed reports that Dr. Tajbakhsh was only released after payment of a substantial bail. Dr. Tajbakhsh's release period was further extended in early April. It remains to be seen whether he will be permitted to leave the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">In a strong statement on Dr. Tajbakhsh's case on 1 December, the EU Presidency reiterated its concerns and described the reports of Dr. Tajbakhsh facing additional charges as "deeply worrying". The EU statement urged Iran to comply with all international and regional human rights instruments which it had ratified, and not least with the relevant articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding the right to a fair trial, which is also enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The case of Dr. Tajbakhsh, as an American citizen, continues to be dealt with actively by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran. Our Embassy in Tehran also continues to monitor closely the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">Senior officials of my Department have raised Dr. Tajbakhsh's case directly with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland and have made clear our concerns at his sentencing. We will continue to bring the case of detainees such as Dr. Tajbakhsh to the attention of the Iranian authorities. We will also avail of every opportunity to express our concerns about the marked deterioration of human rights in Iran, both nationally and in an EU and international context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1836">The types of technical functions that are common to the institutions in question and which will be considered for merger are: Paper Conservation, Digitisation, Collections Management, Exhibitions, Education and Outreach and Maps. It is anticipated that this will have a beneficial effect on the collections of the institutions and it will be easier to exhibit material from the national collections held than is currently the case. While the exact future cost savings are difficult to isolate it is clear that savings can be achieved by this measure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1838">Under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, 45 pools have been opened throughout the country and twelve other projects are at various stages of the Programme.  The total expenditure of €142.7m under the Programme from 2000 to the end of 2009 leveraged a total investment of some €400m in swimming pools throughout the country.  The allocation of €7.5m in 2010 will be sufficient to meet commitments arising in 2010 under the current round of the Programme.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1841">These grant allocations are subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which include the execution of a Deed of Covenant and Charge. A Deed provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The Department’s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor’s Office (CSSO), deals with the grantee’s solicitor in executing this Deed. The latest update from the CSSO is that the preparation of the deed is at an advanced stage and is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">As soon as the legalities are finalised and upon receipt of a valid tax clearance certificate from the organisation, my Department will be in a position to make a payment of almost €117k on foot of invoices already submitted by the organisation which have been examined and certified by the Department's technical advisers, the OPW.</p>

         his plans in relation to the proposal by the European Commission that the EU should set a target of reducing poverty by 25% by 2020; and if he will ensure that Ireland actively promotes and advocates the acceptance of this target.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2124">The European Council at its meeting in March 2010 agreed on the inclusion of five headline targets in <i>Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth</i>. The targets constitute shared objectives guiding the action of the member states and the union on the key areas where action is needed: knowledge and innovation, a more sustainable economy, high employment and social inclusion. The EU poverty targets will be translated into national targets to take account of the differing starting points of member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">One of the targets is promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty. The purpose of the target is to measure progress in reducing poverty and in ensuring that the benefits of growth and jobs are shared. The Commission proposed a target of reducing poverty in Europe by 25 per cent or 20 million people using the at-risk-of-poverty indicator. The European Council decided that further work is needed on appropriate indicators and will revert to this issue at its June 2010 meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">The Irish Government supports the decision to include a poverty target in the European strategy for 2020, but has expressed methodological reservations about the sole use of the ‘at-risk-of-poverty' indicator. Since 1997, the Irish Government has adopted poverty targets as part of its national policy against poverty and for social inclusion. The Irish target is based on a composite poverty measure called ‘consistent poverty'. The measure identifies the percentage of the population which is both below 60 per cent of median income (known as ‘at-risk-of-poverty') and experiencing material deprivation (the enforced lack of two or more basic necessities).</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">The government target in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016</i> is to further reduce consistent poverty to between 2-4 per cent by 2012 and to eliminate it by 2016. The latest results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), released in November  2009, which applied to 2008, indicated at that stage that the reductions in poverty were on track to achieve both the 2012 and 2016 targets.  It showed that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2008 was 4.2 per cent, down from 5.1 per cent in 2007 and 6.5 per cent in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">The EU Social Protection Committee though an expert sub-group is examining the appropriate indicators for an EU poverty target and will make a recommendation to the EPSCO Council on 7/8 June. Officials of the Department are actively participating in these deliberations. The committee's recommendations for appropriate indicators for a poverty target will be considered at the relevant European Council meetings in June.</p>

            <p eId="para_2136">As a result from 1st January 2010, treatments available under the optical and dental elements of the scheme are limited to the free examination.  There has been no change to the medical appliances element of the scheme.  Over 2 million PRSI contributors are eligible for the free dental and optical examination and medical appliance benefit in 2010. In 2009 over 418,000 customers claimed a free dental examination at a cost of over €14 million.  In addition 219,000 free eye examinations, at a cost of almost €5.5 million were also provided.  There were also 7,500 treatments under the medical appliance scheme, at a cost of over €7.5million.  Similar levels of applications can be expected this year.

The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.

            <p eId="para_2206">Disablement benefit, payable under the Occupational Injuries Scheme, is a compensation payment for loss of faculty arising out of or in the course of insurable employment. Disablement Benefit may be paid as a once off gratuity or in the form of a Disablement Pension which can be payable for life.  Weekly rates of primary income support payments to those aged 66 and over were protected from the reductions in welfare rates provided for in Budget 2010. Disablement Pension is a compensation payment not a primary income support payment, so it is not excluded from these budgetary reductions. It should be noted that Disablement Pension is payable in addition to any other Social Welfare payment, including the State (Contributory and Non-Contributory) Pensions. It can also be paid to a person where he or she has returned to work.</p>

            <p eId="para_2208">The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HS E) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  There is an income limit for the fuel allowance. An applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to €100.00 a week or saving/investments of up to €58,000 above the appropriate maximum contributory rate of old age pension and still qualify for the allowance in the case of non means tested payments. There is no additional means test to qualify for fuel allowance for those already on a long-term means tested payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">The person concerned applied for the fuel allowance when submitting his application for State Pension Contributory in December 2009. He did not complete the relevant Section of the form relating to his fuel application where details of his weekly income, savings, investments, rent from property or profit from any business (if any) were requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">However, Departmental records were examined and these records showed that in 2008 the person concerned had a private pension of €14,047 per annum (€270.65 p.w.) in addition to his State Pension Contributory amount of €225.80 giving a total weekly income of €496.45. This is in excess of the income limit of €330.30 applicable to the person concerned, thereby making him ineligible for the fuel allowance. The person concerned was informed of this decision in letter from State Pension Contributory Section dated 11/1/2010.  The person concerned should contact my Department if there have been any changes in his circumstances which would affect his entitlement to fuel allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2215">I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 293 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2216">As with all social welfare schemes, it is necessary to ensure that child benefit is paid to all those who are eligible and that the system is protected against fraud and abuse.  Given the significant changes in the composition of the child benefit customer base, the control policy was reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse continue to be effective and relevant. Based on the evidence of this review, enhanced measures have been devised, which enable the automated issue of forms (certificates) to sub-sets of selected groups of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2217">In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification is requested that the children continue to reside here — the proof of such residence can be provided via details of the school or college their children attend or, if the children are not of school-going age, details of the doctor or crèche they attend. This information is used to verify that the children are resident in Ireland, as required under law. This group includes the person to whom the Deputy refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">With regard to EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualified children living in another EU state and who are entitled to Irish family benefits under EU law, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  The certification letters currently issue on a three monthly basis. Where the required certification is not provided within the timescale requested, 21 days, payment of child benefit is suspended pending further enquiry and ultimately terminated if confirmation of continued entitlement is not forthcoming.</p>
            <p eId="para_2219">The frequency of these requests will be kept under review in the light of the evidence. PRSI contribution data are not available in as timely a way as would be required, as records are updated annually.  In addition, in most cases child benefit is paid to the mother and there may not be a link with the father's PPS No. which would make matching very difficult.</p>

However, during the week ending 5th February 2010, the central HRC Unit undertook a manual exercise to analyse the outcomes of habitual residency cases relating to Irish born citizens who had applied for Jobseeker's Allowance. 125 cases of Irish born citizens were decided that week and 122 cases were allowed. The 3 disallowed cases related to people who said they were born in the State and subsequently emigrated. In 2 of these cases, there was no evidence that the people involved ever lived in Ireland and in the third case the person intended to stay less than a year as his family continue to reside in Australia.</p>

            <p eId="para_2229">The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  A detailed review of the fuel allowance scheme was carried out a number of years ago. This review looked at alternatives to the weekly payment method including a single lump sum payment. A survey of recipients with the allowance, carried out in conjunction with the review, showed that the majority favoured weekly payments. The review recommended continuing with the weekly payment method.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">While the payment of fuel allowance in lump sums could be advantageous for some people, there would also be disadvantages. The lump sum payment might not be used for the purpose of fuel purchase leading to hardship at a later stage and recourse having to be made to supplementary welfare allowance payments. A person's circumstances could change, leading to disqualification from payment of fuel allowance resulting in an overpayment having to be refunded.  Payment of a lump sum in arrears would not be a viable option for persons with immediate needs during the winter period. Many oil companies provide facilities for making payment by instalments over a period of time which allows people to plan and budget for fuel expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">The Department is examining alternatives to the weekly payment method including lump sum payments. A number of issues need to be considered in detail including the administrative costs and processes involved in any changes to the current method of paying fuel allowance on a weekly basis. When all issues have been examined, a decision can be made in the best interests of all fuel allowance recipients.</p>

This follows the transfer of the scheme from the Health Service Executive on foot of a Government decision to reallocate certain functions between Departments and Agencies as part of the health service reform programme.

Decisions have been revised by the Deciding Officer in 165 cases following review based on additional information supplied, 3 withdrawn, 49 have been disallowed, 1 partially allowed and 7 allowed by the appeals officer.  The information requested in relation to a breakdown of appeal outcomes by county is not held. Information on the number, and outcomes, of applications received before April 2009 is not held by the Department as the Domiciliary Care Allowance scheme was operated by the HSE prior to this date.</p>

            <p eId="para_2244">In order to qualify for domiciliary care allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">Eligibility for domiciliary care allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  As such it is not possible to say if a child with ODD, ADHD or any other intellectual disability will qualify for a payment under the scheme.  In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor.

            <p eId="para_2261">The Jessica Programme (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) was launched by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank in co-operation with the Council of Europe Development Bank in 2005 as a means of introducing resources from EU structural funds into urban development, in tandem with national or local grant programmes.  It is a form of Public Private Partnership (PPP) which can only be used on the basis of integrated urban development plans and only on projects which generate revenue.  It is open to Dublin City Council, should they wish, in liaison with my Department, to explore funding possibilities under this programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_2263">The National Climate Change Strategy signalled the possibility of supplementing greenhouse gas emission reductions with the purchase of up to 3.6 million carbon credits on average each year in the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012 or 18 million credits in total, costing an estimated €270m.  Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has been designated as purchasing agent for the State. To date, the NTMA has purchased 5.255m certified emission reduction units at a cost of some €73.7m exclusive of VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">Prior to the designation of the NTMA as purchasing agent, my Department committed €10 million each to the Carbon Fund for Europe and the BioCarbon Fund operated by the World Bank. In December 2006, my Department entered into an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to invest €20m in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund. This investment was made on foot of a once-off provision from the Department's vote. Management of these investments is a matter for my Department and they are expected to yield some 3m carbon credits at an estimated cost of some €26m prior to the end of the five-year Kyoto commitment period 2008-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">The economic downturn has implications for the purchasing programme. Recent EPA projections suggest that, with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures, we may already have purchased or contracted to purchase sufficient carbon credits to meet our Kyoto commitment. In the circumstances, the NTMA has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future. In the current economic climate an unusually high degree of uncertainty attaches to all projections. Accordingly, purchasing requirements to ensure Kyoto compliance are being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2269">While economic instruments such as that proposed in the Question can contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives the key to success in tackling the issue in question is to foster a public attitude that looks upon the behaviour concerned as unacceptable.  Awareness raising, education and enforcement are critical in this regard and my Department provides support to a number of successful partnership initiatives, provides local authorities with grants for awareness schemes involving local communities, and also contributes significantly to the cost of employing enforcement officers.  In addition to these initiatives, over the past 8 years my Department has been assisting local authorities by meeting up to 75% of the capital cost of waste recycling infrastructure to provide a convenient means to dispose of items responsibly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">In November 2009 I published the consultants' report in the International Review of Waste Management.  The consultants considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the possibility of introducing deposit-refund schemes and concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to support a recommendation to introduce such schemes, but further study was merited to assess whether the benefits of such schemes outweighed the costs.  The consultants suggested that the issue should be considered further, with the benefit of further study, should other recommendations relating to targets for packaging recycling not be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">In the coming weeks, I will be publishing a consultation document to allow all parties to contribute to the debate on how best to develop a sustainable, resource-based waste management policy.

            <p eId="para_2284">The position regarding implementation of Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 has been set out in replies to previous Questions, and most recently in the reply to Question No. 270 of 10 February, 2010.   My colleague, the Minster for Housing and Local Services, Michael Finneran T.D., held a meeting in August 2009 with representatives from the group called "Architects Alliance" in regard to Part 3 of the Act, in particular the technical assessment process.  Part 3 of the Act provides for registration of the title of "Architect".</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), which is designated as registration body for Architects under the Building Control Act 2007, has established an Admissions Board and a Technical Assessment Board so that the registration process may commence in the near future.  The RIAI has appointed architects to the boards and I have appointed the Chairpersons and nominated the non-architect majority to both boards.  I have received and examined a submission from the RIAI on all registration fees under the Act and I am currently awaiting further information on the submission from the RIAI, which I requested at a recent meeting with representatives of the organisation</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">Section 14 of the Act sets out the eligibility criteria for registration in the statutory register of architects. Section 21 of the Act provides for the establishment of the Technical Assessment Board which will set out the criteria for assessment and consider applications for registration from persons who have been practising architecture for a minimum period of 10 years in the State.  Section 22 sets out the procedures for the operation of the Technical Assessment Board.  The Act provides for an appeal against a decision of the Technical Assessment Board to an Appeals Board which will be appointed shortly.   The Appeals Board will also have an independent Chairperson and a majority of lay members. There is ultimately an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Appeals Board or any other Board or Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_2287">Once statutory registration has formally commenced it will be an offence under sections 18 (1)(a) and 18(1)(d) of the Act to use the title of "Architect" unless registered on the statutory register.  However, those sections will not apply</p>

I will conclude my consideration of the report and any recommendations it contains as rapidly as possible, and will then be in touch with affected individuals and representative groups in regard to the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_2307">The planning code provides a vehicle for controlling noise from construction works and from the use of premises for which planning permission is granted. While there are no times specified statutorily during which construction works are prohibited, on a case by case basis, conditions can be attached to individual permissions, under section 34(4) of the Planning and Development Acts to "reduce or prevent the emission or the intrusion of noise and vibration," through, for example, imposing restrictions on noise levels during the construction phase and/or imposing permitted noise levels and operating hours that are permitted in the use of the premises.  It is open to anybody suffering a noise nuisance from construction works to contact their Planning Authority and ascertain if such restrictions apply and to report any apparent breaches of the planning permission granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2308">In addition, a person may contact their local authority to ascertain if it will initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  It is also open to any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated under section 108 of the Act.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department's website www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2309">The Government is committed to introducing comprehensive legislation on noise pollution more generally. As part of the preparatory process, extensive public consultation was undertaken during which over 200 submissions were received from the public and key stakeholders. After due consideration of these submissions, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was prepared and approved by the Government in May 2009 and is scheduled for publication later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2310">Given the measures outlined above which are already in place to deal with noise from construction, further legislative measures in this area are not being considered in the context of the Noise Nuisance Bill. However, it is envisaged that the Bill will provide for the development of a number of codes of practice, including in relation to noise from construction activity.  The issue of the times within which construction works should be permitted to be undertaken will be among the many issues considered in the development of the relevant code of practice in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2314">I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 to 330, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)  estimates that up to 250,000 tonnes of municipal and commercial waste from Ireland was illegally deposited at 20 sites in Northern Ireland between October 2002 and the end of 2004. As there are legal proceedings involved, NIEA are not releasing specific details of the sites concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">A framework agreement between both jurisdictions was endorsed by Environment Ministers in June 2009. The framework itself derives from a ‘road map' in relation to co-operation in dealing with illegal waste movements, which was endorsed by both jurisdictions in October 2007 and by the European Commission. Under the Framework Agreement the full cost of disposal, or other necessary management of the waste, will be met by Ireland but the costs of excavating, examining and removing the waste and remediating the site afterwards will be apportioned on the basis of 80% Ireland, 20% Northern Ireland.   I have arranged for copies of both the road map and the agreement to be sent to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">The agreement relates in the first instance to the removal of illegally dumped waste at two priority sites, at Slattinagh, Co Fermanagh and near Trillick, Co Tyrone, involving 14,000 tonnes of waste. The approach followed in these cases will form the basis for action on the remaining 18 sites. The NIEA will prioritise the order in which these sites will be dealt with, based on a number of factors including the risk of environmental pollution.  I understand that a site in Ballymartin, Co. Down will be the next site to be dealt with, in 2011, following the two sites referred to above.</p>

            <p eId="para_2319">My responsibilities under the Wildlife Acts relate to the conservation of populations of certain protected species including the badger. Badgers may not be hunted, injured or wilfully interfered with or their breeding place destroyed. However, the legislation enables me, as Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to issue a licence to a person to capture and humanely kill a protected wild animal for specified scientific or other purposes.  Since 2004, 30 licences have been issued annually to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food — one for each District Veterinary Office (DVO).  There is one DVO per county, with the exception of County Cork, which has 3, and Counties Tipperary and Wicklow, which have 2 DVOs each.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">These licences permit taking and humane killing of badgers for the purpose of carrying out research into bovine tuberculosis in cattle and badgers, which the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food considers essential. The badger has been identified as an important reservoir of <i>Mycobacterium bovis, </i>the bacterium that causes bovine tuberculosis (TB).</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">Licences issued in this regard are subject to strict conditions and must comply with the Part 3(d) of Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations 2003 which specifically stipulates, with respect to badgers, that a "stopped body restraint", complying to certain dimensions, must be used when capturing badgers.  Figures provided by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food indicate that in 2009 just over 6,000 badgers were captured compared to almost 7,300 in 2008.  I understand that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is funding research on the development of a bait based vaccination against TB for badgers and that a pilot project has commenced.  I would be hopeful that an effective vaccination will become available as a result of this research.</p>

To this end, they have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.  While I have no plans to amend the Derelict Sites Act at this time, as I indicated in reply to Priority Question No. 4 on 22 April 2010, I will keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities in addressing the issue of unfinished or unoccupied estates under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2325">Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.  I understand that broadband is available in the general area of Rockorry village, County Monaghan, from wireless service providers and therefore this area will not be addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">It is important to clarify that, in designing the NBS, which was approved by the EU Commission, a balance had to be struck between reaching as many un-served areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas.  EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  Details of telecommunications service providers operating in county Monaghan can be found at www.callcosts.ie on ComReg's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2327">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_2328">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding and granted State Aid approval for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would be available to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>

            <p eId="para_2331">I propose to take Questions Nos. 334 and 335 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">Electric vehicles offer an increasingly realistic solution to the challenge of reducing the transport sector's Greenhouse Gas Emissions and reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.  There is now very significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest internationally in Ireland's decision to be an early mover in this field.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test-bed particularly in relation to network infrastructure development.  The Government has set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which equates to around 225,000 vehicles.  Ireland aims to be at the forefront of technology developments and we are working with relevant Departments and Agencies to ensure that the necessary policies and infrastructure are in place to meet this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">In the European Union context, the Spanish Presidency has placed electric vehicles firmly on the EU energy policy agenda.  The Presidency, together with Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, has underlined the real opportunities for Europe to transform energy use in transport.  We agreed at the informal meeting of Energy Ministers in Seville last January that the development of electric vehicles technology and standards should be progressed by the European Union as part of delivery of energy efficient and low carbon systems.  Informed by those discussions, the Commission will bring forward a policy document in relation to green vehicles shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">The Council has also agreed that electric vehicles will be included as a priority technology sector under the Strategic Energy Technology Plan.  ESB, through its membership of Eurelectric, is also playing a leading role in work by European utilities and car manufacturers to progress essential technical standardisation across Europe.  The challenge now for Ireland is to develop a cost efficient electric vehicle infrastructure network, together with measures to develop a market for the vehicles themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">An Agreement establishing a comprehensive partnership to position Ireland as one of the European leaders in electric transport was recently signed by myself, the ESB and the Renault-Nissan Alliance.  This new Agreement, builds on the Memorandum of Understanding signed in April last year to study the promotion of electric vehicles in Ireland, and includes the development of a nationwide electric car charging infrastructure, the continued sharing of technical and market data between the parties and the early supply of electric cars into the Irish market by both Renault and Nissan from 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">Under the agreement, ESB will roll out 1,500 charge points nationwide by December 2011.  The roll out has already begun in Dublin and charging points will also be installed in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  ESB also plans to install 30 fast charge points across Ireland by the end of 2011, with nine expected to be set up by the end of this year.  The intention is that the infrastructure will be non-exclusive and that, on a market basis, it will be readily accessible by all electricity supply companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">A number of incentives are already in place which underline the Government's commitment to promoting electric vehicles in Ireland.  The VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the VRT reliefs of up to €2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles, which were due to end in Dec 2010, have been extended in the last budget for a further two year period.  In addition to this I recently announced that those purchasing an electric vehicle will be grant aided for a 2-year period of up to €5,000, depending on the price of the vehicle.  Grant aid of up to €2,500 is also being provided for eligible plug in hybrid electric vehicles.  The grant scheme will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and full details will be finalised in the coming months in advance of the scheme commencement date of Jan 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">The support schemes are non-exclusive and will be open to any vehicle from any manufacturer which meets the qualifying criteria.  My Department does not have statistics in relation to the number of electric or hybrid vehicles in the public sector vehicle fleet.</p>

            <p eId="para_2342">The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e over the telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Details of broadband services available in each county, including county Offaly, can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">Kinnitty, County Offaly, does not come within the scope of the National Broadband Scheme which aims to provide access to affordable and scalable broadband services to fixed residences and businesses within its designated rural areas.  This is because, in designing the NBS, which was approved by the EU Commission, a balance had to be struck between reaching as many unserved areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas.  EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding and granted State Aid approval for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would be available to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>

            <p eId="para_2349">The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) is continuing to work towards its development objectives to grow the Digital Hub.  As of early 2010 there were 98 companies operating in the Digital Hub with 664 full time and a further 220 part time employees.  The DHDA continues to promote the identity and brand of the Hub and companies located there have enjoyed notable successes and have gained national and international recognition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">On its educational remit the DHDA has delivered a very successful learning programme, which has provided state-of-the-art digital media education to schools and the wider community in Dublin's inner city.  The DHDA has developed an award-winning community engagement process, the Community Public Private Partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">The DHDA has reached the point where all of its own available office space has been occupied and has leased office space to meet the requirements of its tenant companies.  An additional 20,000 square feet will be delivered shortly through redevelopment of a building in the Hub in partnership with the OPW.   The Agency had plans for the development of further office space that would have eliminated its reliance on Exchequer funding.  This development is not progressing at present and the Agency is pursuing the matter with the two developers concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">I have initiated a review of the DHDA which is currently underway.  It will, <i>inter alia</i>, focus on the objectives of the Agency, how these have been achieved and set out recommendations for the continuing role of the Agency and its potential role in the delivery of the Government’s Smart Economy objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_2354">The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.

            <p eId="para_2355">Since the excise relief schemes were introduced there has been a steady increase in biofuels used in Ireland, albeit from a very low base.  Prior to the introduction of the schemes, market penetration of biofuels was almost non-existent.  In 2007, penetration was 0.6% and in 2008 penetration had risen to 1.6%.  While figures for 2009 are not yet available the penetration rate is expected to be in the region of 2.5%.  While my Department is aware that there are other companies outside of the Scheme producing biofuel my Department does not have details of these companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_2357">There are currently approximately 1,540 megawatts (MWS) of renewable powered electricity generating plants accessing the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  There are almost 100 windfarms connected with a combined capacity of around 1,264 MWs, compared to hydro-power with 240 MWs connected and the balance made up of biomass, mainly landfill gas.  Based on current technology trends, the dominance in the renewable sector of the wind-powered category is expected to continue out to 2020 at least.  The amount of renewable-powered plant connected and accessing the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year. In 2008, 12.2% of all electricity consumed came from renewable resources compared to just 4.4% in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">Under EU Directive 2001/77/EC, Ireland has a target of 13.2% for renewable electricity to be achieved by 2010.  Ireland is on track to exceed this target and will meet the higher national target of 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  Under the recently agreed Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland's target is for 16% of all energy (to include electricity, heating and transport) to be from renewable sources by 2020.  The Government's target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 is commensurate with Ireland's EU target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">In December 2008, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) issued a decision which requires EirGrid and ESB Networks to provide connection offers for an additional 3,900 MWs of new renewable capacity to ensure the 2020 target can be achieved.  This additional level of capacity, taken together with the capacity already built and the capacity that already has connection offers, is capable of meeting our 40% 2020 electricity target which EirGrid and the CER equate to an overall capacity of 5,800 MW of renewable capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">Estimates of the costs of the introduction of postcodes are contained in the Report of the Postcode Project Board, which was published in 2006 and a Cost Benefit analysis published in 2008.  Copies of both reports are available on the website of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">The non-recurring initial capital cost of the establishment of postcodes will be €15m.  Recurring costs are estimated at €2.5m annually.  The actual gross costs, which will be incurred on foot of postcode implementation in the public and private sectors, will be determined by the proposal which is chosen for system implementation by public procurement.  The net costs of postcode implementation will be a function of both the gross costs and the gross benefits accruing over time as a result of the implementation of the project.  These again will be determined by the proposal, which is chosen for system implementation through public procurement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2364">Television licence revenue is generated from the sales of television licences and the recoupment of the cost of free television licences from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is no fund reserve as such because the revenue generated is received and paid out on an ongoing basis.  The annual income generated from television licences was €226.2m in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">Under Section 123 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, I may pay RTÉ in respect of each financial year an amount equal to the total of receipts in that year in respect of broadcasting (TV) licence fees less (i) any expenses incurred in relation to the collection of those fees, and (ii) an amount being equal to 7% of these net television licence fee receipts, which is paid under Section 156 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in respect of the Broadcasting Funding Scheme.  This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the 2009 Act, to support public service broadcasting activities.  In effect, therefore, RTÉ is now being paid 93% of net television licence fee receipts on an annual basis.</p>

Approximately 90% of those in Gate 3 are wind powered capacity including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  Grid connection offers for projects within the Gate 3 process began to issue in December 2009 and will continue to be issued on a phased basis until mid 2011.

Last summer the 83 km offshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline was installed.  The developers are engaged in the process of securing a number of statutory consents required for the construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline.  Completion of the development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.

The relevant service providers operate in a fully liberalised market.

            <p eId="para_2403">The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over the telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">The Government intervenes when there is clear evidence of market failure.  An example of such an intervention is the National Broadband Scheme which aims to provide access to affordable and scalable broadband services to fixed residences and businesses within certain designated rural areas. 11 electoral divisions in county Kildare are included in this Scheme.  Details of these areas can be found on the NBS service provider's (3 Ireland) website, <i>www.three.ie</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2405">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  In addition, we have received State Aid clearance from the Commission for the scheme.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas. This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.   It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.   The application process has not yet begun.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>

            <p eId="para_2460">I am aware of the decline in numbers in the national flock, although Ireland is not unique in that regard. Most of the main sheep-producing countries in Europe and indeed worldwide are facing problems, with reducing flocks, pressure on income and producers leaving the sector.  I have identified this sector as one in need of specific supports and earlier this month, I launched a three-year, €54 million grassland sheep scheme, the funding for which, comes from unused Single Payment funds. The focus of this scheme is on breeding ewes and it should help to prevent further declines in flock numbers, by giving farmers a real incentive to maintain their production levels. It should also provide sheep farmers with a much-needed boost to their incomes.  The sector should also benefit under the Rural Development Programme, where an indicative figure of €8 million has been allocated for sheep fencing and mobile handling facilities, to help sheep farmers in reducing labour input.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">In addition to this extra funding, last year I assigned €7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve to 13,000 hill sheep farmers, under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme. Bord Bia will also spend up to €1 million this year on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad and Teagasc has allocated almost €1.5 million for sheep research for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">All of these supports complement the work being undertaken by my Department, its state agencies and the industry, following the recommendations of the Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group — "the Malone Report". This report provides a clear blueprint for the development of a more profitable sheep sector in Ireland and covers production, processing and marketing. While most of the recommendations in the Malone report fall to be implemented by the industry itself, my Department is playing its part by providing assistance for areas such as breeding and quality assurance. I am confident that every effort is being made to support this sector, which is a valuable part of the overall agrifood sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2464">The implementation of a carbon tax on fossil fuels is, in the first instance, a matter for my colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Finance Bill, 2010, introduced carbon taxation of mineral oils, which will apply to petrol, auto-diesel, kerosene, marked gas oil, liquid petroleum gas, fuel oil and natural gas. These increases, which, when VAT is included, amounted to 4.2 cent on a litre of petrol and 4.9 cent on a litre of diesel, arose from the application, in budget 2010, of a carbon charge on those fuels, at a rate equivalent to €15 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted.  </p>
            <p eId="para_2465">When introducing the levy, Minister Gormley explained the principle of carbon pricing, noting that this mechanism is widely accepted as the most effective way to secure emission reductions. It is the basis of the EU's Emission Trading Scheme, which applies to the bigger emitters such as power generators and industrial plants and a significant number of food processing installations. Apart from installations that have already made very considerable emissions reductions through their participation in the EU's emissions trading scheme, no other sector of society is exempt from the tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_2466">The aim of the carbon tax is to promote economies in the consumption of fossil fuel and a consequent reduction in emissions.  At present, each litre of gas oil, whether used in a tractor, diesel engine car or truck, generates the equivalent of almost 3 kilograms of Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). In 2008, greenhouse gas emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuel in the agriculture sector were over 850,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent. The imposition of the carbon levy is not without consequence for farmers and for tillage farmers in particular.  However, the agriculture sector will continue to benefit from a special reduced excise duty rate of 4.7 cent per litre in relation to marked gas oil, which is far below the excise duty rate of 41 cent per litre applied to auto-diesel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">Together with my Government colleagues, I intend to ensure that up to date guidance material is provided on how best to reduce fossil fuel based energy use. My colleague, the Minister for Finance has indicated me that the estimated amount of revenue arising from a carbon tax of €15 per tonne on marked gas oil or ‘green diesel' used by farmers is €12.5 million in a full year, and, being applied from 1 May, approximately €7 million in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">Energy costs are a significant proportion of production costs for food and drink exporting companies. As costs in Ireland are above the EU average and our indigenous energy sources are limited, this is a competitive issue for the industry.  The continuation of some costs rebate for large energy users and industry's own efforts to make their heat and power systems as energy efficient as possible have mitigated this to an extent but it requires continued attention as the Agrifood sector generates around 30% of our net foreign earnings from the indigenous manufacturing and primary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have not grown at the rate of other sectors but do account for almost 40% of Ireland's non-trading sector emissions. Teagasc is engaged in practical research at farm level on farming techniques that could contribute a modest but permanent reduction in the level of emissions.  Addressing these critical issues, requires a greater commitment to, and implementation of, energy savings and efficiency measures, as well as the development and promotion of large scale uptake of energy from renewable sources.  The government has encouraged measures relating to forestry, the growing of miscanthus and energy conservation to promote local and renewable sources of energy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2471">I introduced this Scheme to provide some compensation to growers for damage to potatoes and root vegetables caused by frost in January of this year. The Scheme is aimed at providing a limited and targeted financial contribution to those growers, who suffered significant losses of produce due to frost damage. Financial aid will only be paid in instances where genuine damage to crops was caused by the severe frost in January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">The level of aid must not exceed 80% (90% in Disadvantaged Areas) and, for growers that have no crop insurance, the level of compensation must be reduced by 50%. In accordance with EU State Aid Rules, aid is confined to actual losses and conditional on at least 30% of the crop being destroyed when compared with the previous 3 years production.  A total of 357 applications were received nationally, of which 12 applications were received from County Galway; one of these was rejected, as it did not meet the 30% requirement.  The decision as to the level of aid payable to eligible applicants cannot be made until all the necessary investigative work has been completed and the required calculations, as outlined above, are finalised in the case of individual applicants.</p>

            <p eId="para_2479">The regulations set out demarcation limits for supervision in terms of volume of throughput. Where the volume of throughput is greater than specified amounts, an application for approval for a new slaughter plant should be made to my Department, where it is lower the application should be directed to the relevant local authority.  On receipt of an application and the requisite information, the appropriate competent authority will arrange for and carry out an approval inspection to determine whether the establishment meets all of the requirements of the regulations. Areas covered include the establishment's food safety management system, structures, staff training and provision for welfare of animals.

This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left.  At the same time the NCSE is allocating additional posts where the criteria are met. The terms and criteria for the SNA scheme have not changed.</p>

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under my Department's capital budget.  The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2011 and subsequent years. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>

This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs with reference to recent schools' enrolment data. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.

            <p eId="para_2543">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">The NCSE is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools. The review of SNA allocations being carried out by the NCSE, through its network of SENOs is with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met. This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left. At the same time the NCSE is allocating additional posts where the criteria are met. The terms and criteria for the SNA scheme have not changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">The specific information requested by the Deputy regarding SNA posts in the Dublin Central region is not readily available in the format requested.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2547">In the school year 2008/2009 there were 712,945 pupils between the ages of five and sixteen attending primary and post-primary schools aided by this Department. This is the most recent year for which data are available. For children enrolled in such schools but who are unable to attend school for a variety of reasons such as a serious medical problem or where a child does not have a school placement, Home Tuition support may be provided, on application, as a temporary interim measure. This facilitates a compensatory educational service to ensure continuum of education during extended absences.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">As the deputy will be aware if a parent makes a choice of home education for their child they must register the child/ren with the National Educational Welfare Board. In such circumstances the child/ren is not enrolled in a recognised school.  The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, established the National Educational Welfare Board which is charged with ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">The Irish Constitution acknowledges the role of a parent or guardian as the primary educator of the child and has enshrined in law that a parent or guardian may home educate a child. Section 14 (1) of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 states that the National Educational Welfare Board shall establish and maintain a register of all children in receipt of an education in a place other than a recognised school. Where a parent chooses to educate, or have educated, his or her child in a place other than a recognised school, the Act outlines the process of application, assessment, registration and appeal that should be adhered to by the Board. Applications are made to the Board and the education provision assessed before the child is registered. To the end of 2009, the Board has registered 638 children educated at home and 5121 children educated in non-recognised schools, throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">In May 2009, my Department extended the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board to bring together a number of education services namely the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL), the School Completion Programme (SCP), the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST), as well as the National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team thereby providing for a single, more focussed, strategic direction at local, regional and national levels. The underlying rationale for this new single strategic approach is to deliver better outcomes for children, families, and schools through targeted coordinated responses that will more effectively address the challenges that impact negatively on attendance, participation and attainment.</p>

         her views on whether University College Dublin has the right to hold examinations for evening students during the daytime, when this discriminates against students who cannot get leave from employment to sit same, and who are refused the option of an alternative time, therefore failing end of year examinations; if the college has the right to interfere with the employment terms of its part-time students, particularly at a time of recession and high unemployment, nor is it conducive to the principle of life-long education; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2578">I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 400 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers.  The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools.  If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties.  There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">A value for money review of the Supply Teacher Scheme was published in July 2006.  The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties.  This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers ‘‘on call'' all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.  The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.</p>

Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.  For ease of reference, a table listing 26 applications from Co. Sligo schools currently seeking major capital building projects follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_2619">In the context of addressing accommodation needs in the short term, the Department grant-aids the provision of temporary accommodation in respect of schools requiring accommodation to cater for additional staffing allocations while awaiting the provision of permanent accommodation.  The following table, compiled from information sent to my Department by schools in Co. Sligo, shows a list of schools in the county using rented prefabs as temporary classroom facilities.  The rental cost per annum to each school is included in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2938">The issue of patronage and governance of our primary schools is of significant national importance. Irish society will continue to change at pace over the years to come and our education system must therefore continue to adapt and change to reflect this.  I have publicly indicated at the recent INTO conference that I recognise that there is a need to seek the input and views of a wide cross section of contemporary Ireland on the relevant issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2939">As the Deputy is aware consideration of many of the relevant issues is underway already.  A review of procedures for establishment of new primary schools is being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation. Among the range of issues being considered is the issue of patronage including the criteria that must be met to become a patron and the circumstances where changes to patronage may be warranted.  Furthermore, my Department has had discussions on the potential transfer of patronage of Catholic primary schools with senior representatives of the Catholic Church. The Department will shortly be providing an initial list of about 10 areas that can be used to test the concept of reducing the number of Catholic schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2940">There has already been significant consultation around these issues with stakeholders. The extent and nature of the further consultation under consideration will be determined as the work underway is completed.

            <p eId="para_2946">My Department had discussions on this matter with senior representatives of the Catholic Church. The Catholic School Patrons and my Department agreed that it was essential to engage in planning for change. In order to advance the matter, my Department agreed that it would examine a number of initial locations to see what scope or options might exist for change of patronage in these cases. The particular focus was on identifying a sample number of areas of relatively stable demographics where the establishment of new schools was unlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future and where the provision is exclusively Catholic or where there is very limited diversity of provision at present. The aim is that these areas can then be used to trial the modalities by which the number of Catholic places and schools will be reduced and released for others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2947">In this context, officials in my Department are currently carrying out an assessment of 10 locations where changes to patronage may be warranted, given changed demographic profiles in recent decades.  My Department has not yet completed this assessment.  When the assessment is completed it is planned to establish a list of locations where such change may be warranted.  The aim is to complete the assessment within the next month with a view to publication of the list.  I will ensure that the Deputy is provided with a copy of the list and Geographical Information System (GIS) maps of the areas at that time.</p>

The parties to the forum include representatives of the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance. The final contract will then be issued for use by schools and VECs.  I anticipate that the draft contract will be sent to the Staff Side shortly.</p>

         the body responsible for determining or changing Central Applications Office points into universities; the role of the CAO office in this process; the role of her Department in this process; if it will be impossible for bonus points in mathematics to be applied to leaving certificate results if the universities concerned choose not to accept this system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2967">The Deputy will be aware that I have indicated my own view of the desirability of sending a clear signal to our second level students with the introduction of CAO bonus points for achievement in Leaving Certificate mathematics at higher level. I believe that a suitably devised bonus points system could successfully encourage students who study higher level maths not to drop down to ordinary level at the final stage of their programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">The higher education institutions have delegated to the CAO the task of processing applications to their first year undergraduate courses. However, the participating institutions retain the function of making decisions on admissions. Neither my Department nor the Higher Education Authority has any role to play in relation to the operation of the CAO or the admissions policies of third level institutions.</p>
