          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I wish to raise a matter that goes to the heart of our democracy. This House is the forum where the Government responds to the people's representatives. Two years ago a young man died in a night club incident in Cork. Despite two investigations by the Director of Public Prosecutions, no charges have been brought.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">This young man's father is on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House. Yesterday evening, after four weeks of attempting to raise the matter, Deputy Bernard Allen was given permission by the Ceann Comhairle to raise it in the House. The reply was given by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who said that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was unavoidably absent. It later transpired that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was present in the Dáil bar and chose not to come into the Chamber to respond to the sensitive and important matter raised by Deputy Allen concerning the death of a young man.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">This is not the first time this has happened with this Government which is the most arrogant Government we have had in the past 30 years. The Taoiseach is not in the House on Thursdays, the Minister for Finance and his Ministers of State were at Cheltenham when the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 was going through the House. We have health publications being leaked to journalists and public relations personnel training the Minister to respond to difficult issues that might arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">I ask the Taoiseach to outline the reasons why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform chose not to be here last night. I would like the Taoiseach to give a lead on this and to give instructions that where possible on sensitive matters such as this, Ministers come to the House and answer questions from the representatives of the people when they are given time in this House. I ask the Taoiseach to instruct the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to go and speak to Mr. Moynihan outside the gates of Leinster House, to bring him into his Department and to explain to him why justice has not been done in this case and what he intends to do to ensure that some charge is brought against somebody in respect of the death of a young man two years ago. This represents contemptuous treatment of the House and the people, and it goes right to the essence of our democracy. The Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, should see to it that his Ministers respond to questions on behalf of the people in the House.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_7">They do attend the House on a daily basis, both to deal with legislation and during Question Time. I wish to respond, if I may, without interruption, to the questions asked by Deputy Kenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spent more than two hours in the Dáil Chamber yesterday on the business of the House, and he was notified that two matters relating to his Department had been selected for the Adjournment. When the Minister left the Chamber at 7 o'clock, he attended to some other meetings. He had a prior engagement scheduled at the time of the Adjournment and requested Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to take the Adjournment on his behalf. The Minister had cleared the content of replies to the issues raised and ensured that the Minister of State was adequately briefed on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Subsequently, the Minister's engagement was cancelled but he did not change the arrangement because he was quite confident that he had both cleared the replies and adequately briefed the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who took the Adjournment matters. That was accepted by Deputy Allen in the House last night. The record of the House shows that Minister of State, Deputy Callely, stated that he was standing in on the Adjournment for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">It is a matter of some regret that the Minister was not informed of Mr. Moynihan's request for a meeting with him last night or that Mr. Moynihan was in the precincts of the House. The Minister was not aware of that. He was made aware of it late last night and he met Mr. Moynihan this morning and had a detailed discussion with him. Of course, there is no point in me going back over the contents of the case and the DPP's directions. That was dealt with in the House last night. I know that the loss of the life of young Adrian Moynihan was a tragedy for his family and is of great regret to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The completed Garda investigation file was forwarded by the State Solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 2 July 2001 for a decision as to what prosecution, if any, should be instituted. The DPP issued directions on 9 January 2002 that no prosecution should be instituted. The circumstances of Adrian Moynihan's death were subsequently the subject of an inquest which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The House would be aware that the purpose of the inquest was to establish the facts surrounding the death and those facts are on the public record. The inquiry produced findings on the identification of the deceased and the date and place of the death. All of the other details were put on the record last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. Of course, the DPP's judgment is independent in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">I understand that this morning, Mr. Moynihan asked the Minister to look at matters connected with the Garda investigation and how this happened. I also understand the Minister gave Mr. Moynihan an undertaking that he would speak to the Garda authorities on the matter. The Minister is not present in the House because he is attending a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I spoke to his office a short time ago. The Minister said he will return to Mr. Moynihan with the details when he has spoken to the Garda authorities.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I have said this matter goes to the heart of our democracy. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented his script to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, but when he realised he would be in the precinct of the House he should have had the courage to take the debate as his office had prepared the script for the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">This young man died in a nightclub incident two years ago. The Deputy State Pathologist said he died because of the way he was held down. I understand he was bitten on the arm and handcuffed while he was dead. Other details have been put on the public record. I am concerned that a number of those who wished to give evidence in the case were not called to do so. I am glad to hear the Taoiseach indicate that this morning, the Minister spoke to Mr. Moynihan outside the Dáil and assured him that he would have the matter re-investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I do not wish to interfere with the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but I understand the Attorney General is entitled to discuss the facts of a case and the reasons no prosecution was taken. Perhaps that should be done. Does this case not provide ample evidence that after six years of the Taoiseach's leadership of the Government, problems experienced by the victims of crime have not been resolved? People are entitled to thorough explanations, the truth and justice. Will the Taoiseach issue instructions and ensure that Ministers answer questions when necessary, provide full information on ongoing cases and that Mr. Moynihan's case is re-examined until such time as everyone can see that, in the interests of democracy, justice is not only done but is seen to be done? I never again wish to raise a case concerning a Minister who was within the precincts of the House but refused to answer legitimate questions raised in the House by any Member.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">The Minister wishes to clarify that, as was indicated last night, there is no conflict between the coroner for Cork city and the Director of Public Prosecutions. He also indicated that he had been informed on the basis of evidence given at the inquest into the death of the late Adrian Moynihan, the Deputy State Pathologist, Dr. Marie Cassidy, altered her disposition in relation to the case of Mr. Moynihan's death. In light of this and in accordance with the law, the coroner adjourned the inquest to allow the Garda the opportunity to consult with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the new evidence. The Minister was informed by the Garda authorities that the file was resubmitted to the DPP on 16 December 2002 for further consideration and on 24 January 2003, following a full review of the file, the DPP confirmed that his original decision should stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Deputy Kenny said I indicated that the case was being re-opened. It is not. It moved on to the second issue and the DPP examined the new evidence and then closed the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">I cannot interfere with that. Mr. Moynihan today asked that the Minister should look at particular aspects of the Garda investigation. I have no right, authority, nor do I wish to give the impression that I am in any way asking the DPP to look at or re-examine this case because I have no authority to do that and I am not asking him to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_29">It is bound to be a matter of concern to the House when the Taoiseach indicates it is his policy to require Ministers to attend the House to answer questions. In recent years, Cabinet Ministers have scarcely answered one in 20 Adjournment debate matters. I was present on one recent occasion when the same Minister of State took the four Adjournment debate matters. He did not know anything about at least three of them, nor could he be expected to.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">According to news reports, the Standards in Public Office Commission will today publish the declarations under the spending limits in force at the last general election. The well advertised and promoted view is that a number of Members will have exceeded the spending limits. The suggestion is that they will be mostly Ministers. I do not know if that is the case. Will the Taoiseach use this as an excuse to further increase spending limits at elections? When Deputy Noel Dempsey was the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and in keeping with his policy for looking after the disadvantaged, he raised the spending limits by 50% just before the general election. Will that be repeated following whatever announcement is made today?</p>
          <p eId="para_31">On 27 October 2002, <i>Ireland on Sunday </i>reported that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, will scrap legislation which places spending limits on politicians during elections. According to the report, the Minister slammed the arrangements for the general election as “nonsensical and meaningless” and pointed out that politicians could spend what they wanted in the run-up to an election while having to account for every cent during a three-week campaign.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_41">I understand the report by the Standards in Public Office Commission is due to be published shortly. It may show that during the last general election, there was inadvertent overspending by some outgoing Members who used Oireachtas facilities during the campaign. This followed the outcome of a High Court case, the judgment of which was delivered on the afternoon of the 16 May 2002. I believe it would be accepted that outgoing Members from all parties acted in good faith in terms of the use of the facilities provided by the Oireachtas since at the time that was excluded from the Act. That was acknowledged in a press release by the commission last December, when all parties and individuals were completing their forms. The standards commission said it had decided it would be inappropriate to refer a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions where, specifically as a result of the judgment, it found that an overspend had occurred at the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The standards commission went on to explain why it had reached that decision. It said it had regard to the fact that the original High Court judgment was delivered on the afternoon of 16 May 2002, the last day of campaigning in the election. Prior to that date, agents and candidates were entitled to assume that the rules of spending were set out in the relevant legislation and reflected the guidelines published by the commission. The commission has also decided that if an overspend occurred specifically as a result of the judgment, it would not recommend to the Minister for Finance that the amount of the overspend should be deducted from the reimbursement of election expenses payable to the candidate from the Exchequer. Those statements were made last year and that is the context in which this matter should be considered. I recall that in this House last year people were concerned about the workings of the legislation. I am not certain if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has moved on very much in his review of that because he has been dealing with many other issues. I am sure he will return to that issue eventually.</p>

The issue is a straightforward one regarding spending limits at election time, and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government's reported public statements. The public will not know that it is only following the dissolution of the Dáil that spending limits are monitored by the Public Offices Commission and reports must be made. Prior to the dissolution of the Dáil all the money a party has can be spent, and was spent most dramatically by Fianna Fáil.</p>

For example, I recall the civic holiday of St. Patrick's day when the route of the parade in my constituency was postered by one Fianna Fáil candidate. That was only one example of the spend that took place and the 50% increase in limit prior to the election brought in by the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, provided for Fianna Fáil to spend £944,000 more in the election that was held this time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I do not want the Taoiseach to tell us what the flaws are in the operation of the present legislation, or the difficulties with the bureaucracy and how ludicrous some aspects of it may be, or whatever. This is a simple, straightforward question to the Taoiseach. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, whom I happen to note by coincidence was the highest beneficiary of declared contributions, has promised to raise the ceiling. The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government. Is he going to bring in legislation to raise the spending limits during elections or not?</p>

          <p eId="para_65">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Ahern, was heard yesterday on the radio describing how the Government legal action over Sellafield was akin to taking on the might of the British Empire.

Mr. Dessie O'Malley wanted to build a nuclear power station at Carnsore and Mr. Albert Reynolds wanted to give money to the thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield, and succeeded as he was chairing ECOFIN at the time and gave Thorpe the wherewithal to build with a large financial aid package.</p>

If the Government is taking that view is it prepared to appeal and strengthen the case of the Stop Thorpe Alliance Dundalk group in County Louth which has been promised financial aid in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and the programme for government previously, but has not enjoyed fulfilment of the promise, which is not unusual.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">The background to this is that the oral hearings, as I promised some time ago, are taking place and this is the second of two international legal cases we are taking against the United Kingdom regarding Sellafield and the MOX plant. It began yesterday in the Hague. The case is being brought under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the oral proceedings in the case which concerned access to documents took place last October under the OSPAR Convention. The Government has put in a great deal of time and effort building a legal team, a technical team and a scientific team to fight this case. We have used international experts and others to try to assemble our case. The hearings will proceed for the next three weeks from 10-27 June and take place before a five member tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Our concerns centre on the pollution arising from the discharge of radioactive waste from the MOX plant and its associated facilities, including Thorpe in the Irish sea. I thank Deputy Sargent for his party's support for the Government's effort in this case. These cases have been the most significant legal actions taken by Ireland. They represent the Government's absolute commitment to ensuring that our rights under these international conventions regarding Sellafield and its operations are fully vindicated, and the legal team is led by the Attorney General. I know Deputy Sargent would agree with me that the same solidarity that was shown in Westminster yesterday should be shown here today and that while the case is on we should stand by the legal team and support them as was done yesterday in Britain.</p>

On the related matter of protecting us from nuclear pollution in the future does the Taoiseach accept also that the Green Party has co-operated in the national interest in dealing with the Convention on the Future of Europe with the Government line?</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Can he clarify the Government line when it comes to the EURATOM treaty which some pro-nuclear governments want included in the new EU constitution? Does the Government accept that the EURATOM treaty, founded in 1957, is out of date and contrary to the aims for reforming the internal market for electricity, and contrary to the provisions of Article 3.2 requiring the integration of high level environmental protection in all aspects of Union policy areas? Does the Taoiseach have a particular view on how the EURATOM treaty is to be dealt with in the Convention? There are four options, three of which would be acceptable to us: abolition of the treaty, reform of the treaty to take out its pro-nuclear position, or a sunset clause. The only option that is not acceptable is a review of the EURATOM treaty after 2007 a view put by some member states. Which of the options is the Government supporting?</p>

It is on the EURATOM section of the European convention which is being discussed in Reykjavik and an entirely different question from the first.

There appears to be confusion about that. The Progressive Democrats want nothing to do with it, and the Taoiseach's party obviously does.

I also met with the Chief Secretary, Ms Mary Williams; the President of Tynwald, Mr. Noel Cringle; the Speaker of the House of Keys, the Honourable Tony Brown; and former Chief Minister, Sir Miles Walker.

Did he, in the course of his meeting with Mr. Corkhill, invite the Tynwald to join with the Irish Government in its current pressing through legal channels of issues regarding the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria? Did he invite the Isle of Man Government to join with the Irish Government in the matter? Sellafield is of great concern to the Isle of Man's citizenry.

The particular purpose of the invitation from Mr. Corkhill was to address the Euroclub on our membership of the European Union. Most of my discussions were based on European issues but, because Mr. Corkhill and others are members of the British-Irish Council, we discussed other issues on which the Isle of Man is taking a lead. We have continued to keep the Isle of Man, the Nordic countries and Iceland fully briefed on our legal actions. They have not joined with us in those actions but we have received support in some of our cases and initiatives. However, the cases are effectively being run and funded by Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">My Department and the bodies under its aegis are committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all staff. The main body under the aegis of my Department is the Central Statistics Office. We follow the guidelines set out in the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Recruitment, promotion, training and all other benefits and opportunities are decided on the grounds of ability, qualifications and other relevant objective criteria. Of the 193 core staff currently employed in my Department, six people have disabilities. My Department therefore exceeds the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities.

Is the Taoiseach aware of the concerns expressed by many people that there is no possibility of work for those who need personal assistants because the so-called mainstreaming of people with disability problems is not happening? Is that being followed up in the Taoiseach's Department? Is the Taoiseach aware of anyone with a disability who was unable to take up employment in his Department because he or she cannot get a personal assistant as a result of these schemes ending? Will he look into this?</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I cannot claim credit for this but the Department of the Taoiseach was made wheelchair-friendly many years ago. Many meeting rooms in the Department in which meetings under the various social partnership pillars are held are wheelchair-accessible, which is appreciated. There are no difficulties along the lines mentioned by Deputy Kenny in my Department but there are more general difficulties. Different Ministers of State deal with this matter, as it cuts across different areas – education, health and justice – so at least three Ministers are involved in this issue.</p>

Are there any plans to deal with a Deputy who may break a leg and be forced to use a wheelchair? That happened to former Deputy Nora Owen and the late Deputy Jim Mitchell. What are the plans for such cases?</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Is the 3% quota still being observed in the Taoiseach's Department? In general, the figure in the public service is 1.5% and the Taoiseach should give a percentage for his Department, as he merely outlined the number of individuals in his previous reply. Is he responding to the concerns of those with disabilities in Ireland, who complained about the withdrawal of medical cards and other essential benefits for those with disabilities earning over €123 per week? That might apply to those working in his Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">As I said in regard to my Department, the facilities are in place there. Regarding the Houses, when Brian Crowley became a Senator, the Office of the Ceann Comhairle was very helpful in making the changes necessary to help him. Former Deputy David Andrews also had to use a wheelchair for a considerable period and the necessary facilities were also made available to him. Ramps have also been put in place. The facilities are there and while it was not easy, they are certainly in use.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The percentage in my Department is just over 3% but the figure varies in other areas. The percentage in the Law Reform Commission is 5% while small bodies like the National Economic and Social Council and the Information Society Commission have not reached the target. The Central Statistics Office percentage is over 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">We should not just say we are on 3% – we should take opportunities to go higher. Thanks to the Equality Authority, the rules are now quite clear about taking people in on the grounds of ability. I have dealt with the groups which form the Fourth Pillar in social partnership, and in terms of employability, many people in those groups are highly efficient and very good administrators and organisers. People should comply with the percentages, although I know it is not always possible in that in some areas, disabled people are not applying for jobs. Where disabled people apply for jobs, people should take as favourable a view as possible to increase the percentages and not just to maintain them. That is the law now. Recruitment, promotion, training and all other benefits and opportunities are decided on the grounds of ability, qualifications and other relevant objective criteria, so there should be no discrimination.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">Does the Taoiseach know when the policy to recruit a quota of not less than 3% of people with disabilities in the public service was agreed? It must have been about 25 years ago.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_162">That is very close. Is that not a poor performance after 25 years? It is all very well to say that 3% of people with disabilities are employed in the Taoiseach's Department. That is actually six people. That is a poor record, particularly since the Taoiseach has acknowledged implicitly that the 3% quota is not universally observed throughout the public service. Is that not a poor performance? Is anybody in Government driving this? Is it not the case that there are many people with disabilities of one kind or another who would make an excellent contribution to the affairs of running the business of State? It is beginning to look as if a policy embarked upon 25 years ago has been held, more or less, around the minimum objectives set at that time. That is not good enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I will not argue with Deputy Rabbitte on this because I have said people should not look to the 3% target but that they should try to improve on it. I cannot say how it works within the Civil Service Commission and I will not try to do so. In regard to the legal position, I was responsible for this brief for five years as Minister for Labour and at that time, we had to deal with all the reasons this could not be done. I do not think I brought the equality Act through this House but I did much of the work on the legislation which updated much of the 1974 Act which I think was introduced by the former Minister for Labour, Michael O'Leary. The amending Act stated that in recruitment, promotion, training and opportunities people with disabilities had to be given an equal break.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">In the late 1980s, the Civil Service Commission did not recruit too many people but that situation changed dramatically and it began to recruit large numbers. It has perhaps slowed down a bit but it is still substantial. We endeavoured to get those with disabilities through to the interview process, the first step on the ladder towards clerical officer, executive officer and higher executive officer posts. I still support that. One would imagine that the figures should automatically rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The section for which the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is responsible in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment still co-ordinates and deals with this issue. That comprises a small number of people who are aggressive – or at least they were in my time there – and who drive this policy. I will communicate this debate to that section.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">It is recognised that 70% of disabled people are unemployed. Is that not a damning indictment of our failure to address the specific need of people with disabilities? Does the Taoiseach agree that the only way that can be addressed is in a pro-active manner so that those who aspire to joining the workforce and broadening their efforts towards independent living would be facilitated? What measures is the Government currently undertaking or does it propose to take to address that damning statistic where 70% of disabled people are unemployed? Many disabled people lose benefits when they join the workforce.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">A substantial number of disabled people are employed under the old system who would not otherwise have been employed. Training and the changes to the equality Act and in accessibility have been welcome. Many of the organisations with which I have been involved for many years, including since before entering this House, would argue that not all disabled people are looking to be mainstreamed into normal employment. That is not the position and those organisations never argued that case. They have always argued that there is a proportion of disabled people who are available for mainstream employment. We have to improve the rules, entry and the training for those people. We have not reached high standards in that regard, although we have improved the situation. The agencies under my Department employ 30 or 40 disabled people yet 25 years ago, they probably would have employed one or two. That is an improvement but we need to continue to implement the Act which states that when people are going for interview or where there is an open competition, they must be treated equally. That is the law. Disabled people do quite well in the examinations but the numbers are not great, so work in the early years is the important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I will stray on one point, although I will not stray too far. Now that children with disabilities are in the education system and are not totally segregated as in the past, they have a far greater chance. I am familiar with the School for the Blind which educated large numbers of boys and girls. Most young people are now in mainstream education, so they have opportunities to come through in the normal way. I am not saying there was anything wrong with the way they were educated in the past – these were good places. However, being in mainstream education should increase dramatically their employability. It is for us to make sure the structures are in place which allow that to happen. My experience of people with disabilities is that they are very good workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">The National Archives Act 1986 stipulates that all departmental records – i.e., records made or received and held by a Department of State in the course of its business – must be preserved. My Department operates a central registry record keeping system comprising the registry file tracking system and a central repository for the storage of all departmental records. Within this system, documents created are held in official departmental files. The system ensures that all files created in the Department's divisions are recorded centrally.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Guidelines on record keeping, which reflect best practice, are issued to all staff in my Department to ensure that all papers, correspondence, memoranda, notes, etc., either created or received, are filed in the appropriate departmental registry file. When files are 30 years old, in compliance with the National Archives Act 1986, they are transferred to the National Archives on an annual basis, where they are made available for public inspection unless they are withheld under section 8(4) of the Act. As files are processed for release each year, it is normal that some are certified by the appropriate official for retention on the grounds set forth in the Act. My Department has established its own archives liaison unit to implement the transfer of records to the National Archives and liaise closely with staff therein, including the director, to ensure proper compliance with the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">My colleague Deputy Stagg, the Labour Whip, made an application under the Freedom of Information Act for copies of the documents used by the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions. In due course, the freedom of information officer, I presume, in the Taoiseach's office replied to the Deputy saying that these documents are not retained. My legal advice is that this is in breach of the National Archives Act under the precise section to which the Taoiseach referred, and that the very documents listed by him ought to be retained. The Act defines records as books, maps, plans, drawings – including any doodling by the Taoiseach – papers, files, photographs, films, and so on. I am advised that the creative work of his eager beavers in the morning early, on every matter under the sun, is appropriate for Deputy Stagg to seek to access under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

I am merely drawing the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that this is in breach of the National Archives Act. Once they are not destroyed, it is entirely a matter for his freedom of information officer, in the first instance, to judge whether some or all of the documents should be released to Deputy Stagg. After that, we may have to go to the Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">There is no conflict at all. The application was made under one Act and the reason the Deputy Stagg cannot access the documents is because they are destroyed. The reply states as follows:</p>

Do I understand from the Taoiseach that the documents are retained, but in the Department appropriate to the subject matter under question? If that is what the Taoiseach is saying, does it mean, for example, that on a matter appropriate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, Deputy McDowell, Deputy Stagg can make application to the Department and get the note the Taoiseach might have on the given issue?</p>

Is the Taoiseach saying that it is untrue that these notes are not retained, as indicated in this letter? Is he saying that they are retained but are allocated to the Department under whose aegis the matter appropriately falls?

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_506">We are coming to the final stage of the discussion on this legislation. To date the Minister has not accepted any amendment from the Opposition. In this section we are concerned about the lack of a more extensive list of remedies other than compensation, which is only paid <i>ex gratia</i> and then not even if there is a constitutional problem, where an element of incompatibility arises regarding the operation of the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Does the Minister not agree that a remedy of damages alone is not satisfactory or adequate where a loss has been endured by a citizen as a result of failure to meet proper standards in law regarding the convention? Where a conflict arises and an incompatibility is adjudicated to have taken place, there are instances where a remedy of damages is not appropriate. It should be possible to have a broader range of remedies such as, for example, the application of an injunction. There could be a remedy of releasing somebody who was in custody where a criminal offence was involved. Damages would be little use to them in those circumstances. Finally, where conflict and incompatibility arise, there should be the ability to exercise a pardon. That should be included in the section where the element of compensation is dealt with in terms of a Government <i>ex gratia</i> payment. The section limits the remedy exclusively to damages and there is a bureaucratic process for accessing those damages. We will do an injustice if we do not broaden the scope of remedies that are available to make good the damage caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">There is little time left for this debate. This is probably the second serious issue in the Bill, the first one being the context in which the Bill is being introduced into Irish law, which we discussed extensively. What remedies are appropriate to Irish citizens who have suffered as a result of the convention's provisions conflicting with Irish jurisprudence? It would be most desirable if the Minister accepted or introduced an amendment which would allow greater scope of remedy, to include an injunction, a release from custody and provision to grant a pardon to somebody who has suffered.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_511">That gives me the opportunity to cover a number of issues in this section. The section contains the nuts and bolts of the Bill. The Minister should give a commitment that there will be a review of the legislation within 18 months, with a report on the operation of the legislation and a debate on that report. My approach is radically different from the Minister's but it seems to be shared by everybody with any interest in human rights. The Minister has, to a degree, bulldozed his own view through, initially as Attorney General and now as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He will be responsible for the product. We are making a radical change in Irish law, although to judge by the media interest it is hardly noticed, and I am concerned that we get the optimum product. I do not believe we are getting that and that is why there should be a review in 18 months to see how the Bill has operated.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The priority objective of the legislation should have been to ensure that citizens could enforce their convention rights with minimum expense and delay. That will not happen. We should have aimed to ensure that the convention rights would become part and parcel of jurisprudence in all courts but that will not happen under this legislation. I am particularly concerned that under section 3 there are no manageable remedies. There is a complete focus on damages without any reference to the other possible remedies that should be available in pursuance of convention rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">There is no jurisdiction in what is known as the poor man's court, the District Court, and there is no reason that such jurisdiction should not have been made available. It is illogical to have different limitation periods applying regarding convention rights and I have made it clear to the Minister that the overall limitation rights should be reduced. There should be parity regarding convention rights and that is the reason I wanted similar limitation rights applying to the pursuit of claims under this Bill as apply to claims under any other law. Convention rights should be part and parcel of normal jurisprudence.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The other concern about the working of the Bill or the jurisprudence that will apply in pursuing convention rights is that there is silence on the issue of legal aid. It is excluded. My main complaint, however, is that I cannot accept the Minister's approach to redress. There is no redress as of right under section 5. I understand the Minister's rather convoluted thinking, which he had to express in a fashion that fitted in with his approach to the incorporation of convention rights. However, it runs contrary to everything I have ever learned or practised in law to find that where there is a court decision, there is no right for the court to give a remedy. It goes against nature to force through a system which effectively has the Executive deciding on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis what the redress will be where there is a finding by the court. I would not use the word “defective” to describe the Bill, but for all those reasons, many of which we have gone over on Committee Stage and elsewhere over the last six or seven sessions in which we have discussed this Bill, it is certainly not the optimum product we should be putting in place if we were wholeheartedly embracing the incorporation of the convention. While opposing this section, I will merely put the amendment to a voice vote in order to save time and enable us to move on. However, I press upon the Minister the need to give a commitment to review.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">It is possible that the approach adopted by the Minister may turn out to be a good one. It is highly unlikely but I am prepared to have the matter assessed in 18 months on the basis of a review and a report. That is the suggestion I am making to the Minister. He has adopted a few minor amendments we have put forward but they are peripheral amendments. I am glad in particular that he has adopted the amendment giving notice to the Human Rights Commission. Overall, however, the right approach is a commitment to a review and a report and to let us look at the whole issue again perhaps in 2005 in light of the workings of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">The advice I get is that the Bill would be improved by the deletion of the reference to "Convention provisions" and, in particular, if there was a deletion of the words, "on any question in respect of which that Court has jurisdiction."  We are talking in section 4 about judicial notice being taken and what notice should be taken. The suggestion has been made to me that it is superfluous to have a reference to the "Convention provisions," but that is not important. More significant are the three references to judicial notices being taken of declarations and decisions or otherwise of the court established under the convention on any question in respect of which that court has jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">That could lead to great difficulties in respect of proof. If somebody wants to ensure that judicial notice is taken, will he or she then have to show and prove in all cases that notice of decisions, opinions or otherwise is on a question in respect of which the court has jurisdiction? Why is it necessary to include those words? It seems to have a limiting effect. From that point of view I am advised that the Bill would be in better shape if those words were excluded.</p>

These are not major issues but the amendments would tighten up and improve the legislation.</p>

In relation to the proposal to remove the phrase "on any question in respect of which that Court has jurisdiction," we considered it very carefully. We decided that, on balance, it was better to leave it there. I shall just give an example of why. A decision of the committee of Ministers established under a statute of the Council of Europe could be on virtually anything. It is not relevant solely to convention matters. Therefore, judicial notice should be taken in respect of relevant matters by a court which has a relevant jurisdiction to exercise, rather than having judicial notice of everything that the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decides. On balance, we thought it was better to proceed with the Bill the way it is. I am grateful to the Deputies for raising the matter, and we spent some considerable time wondering whether we should accede to their suggestions. However, we decided that, on balance, it was better to stick to what is in the text.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">Without wishing to delay further, I do contend that this could be argued either way. I strongly feel that we would be better off without the reference to "any question in respect of which that Court has jurisdiction" because of the proof issue. Maybe it is an issue we could return to in the context of the review I am talking about. I further suggest that if the phrase is considered to be essential to the legislation, it could be improved by an amendment to the effect that the bodies concerned would be deemed to have jurisdiction until the contrary was proved. My concern is that the onus of proof would be on someone seeking to have judicial notice taken of some decision or otherwise. The way the legislation is now being framed, they would have to prove in every case that the court or the body had jurisdiction. It is an issue we perhaps might return to if the Minister accepts my suggestion of a review of this legislation within the next couple of years.</p>

I do not believe we are going to have the opportunity of giving full and due consideration to section 5, which is an important section. Thus, I can merely touch upon some of the issues that arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Section 5 contains a requirement to show that," no other legal remedy is adequate and available."  I understand the Minister's thinking that the constitutional route should be followed as far as possible, but I am concerned with the element of proof required of a claimant, who will in many ways have to prove a negative to show that, "no other legal remedy is adequate and available", before he or she can proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">A second question arises on the matter of procedure. Will there be serial proceedings and will they be costly? No legal aid is envisaged. In view of this, I am concerned that from the point of view of practice, the section as drafted will not be effective and will not fulfil the requirements of Article 13 of the convention, which specifically provides that the rights and freedoms of everybody set forth in the convention must have an effective remedy before a national authority. Are we providing for an effective remedy in a situation where so many obstacles, including expense, appear to be put in the way of somebody who wishes to plead his or her convention rights? My main concern regarding this section is that an effective remedy will not be provided and that the availability of the convention rights to ordinary citizens will be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I have outlined previously the other difficulties with this section, which I will not rehearse, including my objection to the provisions regarding <i>ex gratia</i> payments. While I understand the Minister's thinking on this aspect, I do not accept his approach. I would have thought he would have the highest regard for the normal principles of jurisprudence and constitutional law, yet he is proposing to put in place a system that is not in accord with normal thinking in this area. The courts will be excluded from giving remedies.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The operation of this section should be reconsidered in the context of the detailed review I press on the Minister to accept. He should be at least prepared to reconsider it in light of the working of the Act. It is not an unreasonable request and is the proper approach. I urge him to accept my proposal for a review and a report on the workings of the Act, following which we can resume this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">Section 5 provides for a declaration of incompatibility, but there is no mechanism for transferring the declaration from the courts to the Taoiseach. Amendment No. 31 proposes that the registrar of the court concerned will transmit a certified copy of an order containing a declaration of incompatibility to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. As it stands, section 5(3) provides that the Taoiseach "shall cause a copy of any order [.] to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas", yet there is no provision for a mechanism to transmit the order to the Taoiseach. The Minister did not address this on Committee Stage, despite a similar amendment in my name. Will he indicate the mechanism to be put in place to allow for this transmission?</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Amendment No. 32 requires the Government to indicate its proposals to address a declaration of incompatibility and I ask the Minister to deal with this aspect. I also ask him to indicate if he will consider a remedy other than one of damages, including whether the Government would consider a pardon in cases where there is a conflict under the convention's provisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_540">Amendment No. 28 in my name seeks to clarify the procedure in the event of a finding of incompatibility. Amendment No. 44, in the name of the Minister, provides that the Human Rights Commission shall also be given notice of proceedings in accordance with the rules of the court. Given that this addresses part of amendment No. 28, it is strange that the Minister has not accepted amendment No. 45, which is also dealt with in amendment No. 28, and which would entitle the Human Rights Commission to appear in proceedings. The Bill provides that only the Attorney General is entitled to appear. Amendment No. 28 is similar to the concerns raised by Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello in their amendments and seeks to clarify procedures in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">I agree with Deputy Costello's point on the question of remedies. In the case of some convicted persons, a pardon would be an appropriate remedy. I do not know if they would have to be still alive. However, as I understand it, and I am subject to correction, under the Constitution, the power of pardon, which expunges guilt, is conferred exclusively on the President, acting on the advice of the Government, but the power to commute penalties can also be conferred by other people. In view of this, a problem arises if we attempt to regulate that power, which is an Executive advisory to the President function under the Constitution. If we start legislating on how it is to be operated we will have a constitutional problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Turning to Deputy Costello's broader question, which has been echoed by other Deputies, it is somehow suggested that there will be no injunctions, declaration and remedies other than damages provided for under the Bill. However, that flows from a view of the Bill, strongly reflected in the contributions made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to this debate, that there are convention rights, a series of things like pillars—</p>

Educational disadvantage had been discovered by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science after the best part of 20 years in Government, and many of those who contributed to the debate on this Bill expressed their views on it. I wanted to point out that I had been to a secondary school in the Dublin Central constituency on the afternoon of the debate. The teachers there had told me not one single child in that school would go on to university or had done so in recent years. I hope the Minister, the Government and everyone concerned, having discovered disadvantage in education, are now intent on doing something about it.</p>

      <b>Mr. Coveney</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the basis for the decision by his Department to allocate 14,000 tons of tonnage to a vessel (details supplied); the quota available to this vessel for catches in Irish waters; and the percentage of that quota which is landed in Irish ports.

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_479">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_563">The licensing and registration of the vessel referred to was facilitated by a decision of the European Commission early last year to grant additional capacity of 14,055 gross tonnes and 14,400 kilowatts in respect of the Irish pelagic fleet segment, to take account of fishing opportunities in Mauritanian and other west African waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The European Commission's decision followed negotiations with the Commission regarding a legitimate application by the company which owns the vessel, under EU legislation in place at that time, which provided for the introduction of additional capacity into the EU fleet where additional fishing opportunities were identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The capacity allocated by the European Commission was additional capacity over and above the existing EU capacity limits for the Irish fleet. The allocation of this additional capacity to bring about the licensing and registration of the vessel on the EU fishing boat register involved protracted negotiations between the Irish authorities and the EU Commission. These negotiations were pursued at both political level by the then Minister with responsibility for fisheries and at official level, as is the norm. The then Attorney General was consulted and his officials provided advice on a regular basis throughout the process. The Taoiseach wrote to the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, supporting the case made by the Minister to Commissioner Fischler seeking an interim solution in respect of the licensing and registration of the vessel pending formal agreement by the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">As part of the overall agreement the company which owns the vessel has permanently withdrawn its other vessel from the Irish-EU fishing fleet – this vessel was, until the introduction of the new vessel, the largest in the Irish fleet. This represents a significant contribution by the company to resolving the outstanding power over-capacity in the Irish pelagic segment. The Commission's agreement to facilitate the introduction of the vessel referred to in the question was subject to resolution of the over-capacity problem in the pelagic segment.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">As part of the overall package, the company retains its annual quota and fishing effort entitlements in EU waters associated with the vessel withdrawn by the company. The company is utilising the vessel referred to in the question to take up these entitlements. The vessel has not landed any of its catch in Irish ports.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The licensing and registration of the vessel is an acknowledgement by the Commission of the legitimate potential of the Irish fishing industry to develop sustainable fishing opportunities at international level. These have traditionally been the preserve of other EU and third country players. I stress that the involvement of Irish and other EU fishing vessels in the fisheries of developing countries must be based on sustainability of the fish stocks in question, as well as of the indigenous communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"><i>Additional information:</i>I fully agree with the need for close alignment between fisheries policy objectives and development policy aims. In that context a scientist from the Marine Institute of Ireland is participating on a joint EU-Mauritanian scientific committee which is monitoring closely the situation of pelagic stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The company will continue to primarily focus its attention on developing sustainable fishing opportunities outside the EU and positioning itself as a successful player in the international seafood market.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_572">That is unfortunate as I thought we would have more time on this complex issue. The story of the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> is one of ambition on the part of one person, who is to be admired for that, but there are also complexities involved in how the vessel got a licence in the first place, as anyone who saw “Prime Time” last Thursday will know.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I have three straightforward questions, which are being asked in every fishing port in the country. First, how can the Minister justify one vessel receiving 14,000 geometric tonnes free of charge to facilitate receiving its licence? Every other boat owner, skipper or company enlarging their boats needs to buy the extra tonnage on the open market for approximately €6,000 to €7,000 per tonne. The <i>Atlantic Dawn </i>company receives 14,000 gt free of charge, an asset worth approximately €70 million if one calculates it on the basis of the open market value of tonnage. Fishermen are owed an explanation as to how that can be justified. This massive level of tonnage, 14,000 gross tonnes worth €70 million, was given free of charge to one vessel in the Irish fleet. The vessel catches fish for about 98 days in EU waters but lands no fish here; it spends most of its time off the coast of Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Second, regarding the vessel formerly owned by <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> company, the <i>Veronica,</i> the kilowattage or power of that vessel was transferred across to the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> to facilitate the issuing of a licence. I understand the logic of that but why was the tonnage not transferred from the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> to the <i>Veronica</i>?</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_575">The <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> has been added to the Irish pelagic fleet under the terms of the Commission decision, which gives Ireland the necessary additional capacity. In this exceptional situation, the normal 100% replacement capacity requirement does not apply. This is similar to the capacity added by the Commission to Ireland's MGP in 1996 and also to that agreed earlier this year regarding the inshore fleet, which will enable a large number of small fishermen to regularise their status without having to find replacement capacity. Neither the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> nor the <i>Veronica</i> has any entitlement to fish EU whitefish stocks. There is no question of the<i>Atlantic Dawn</i> having <i>carte blanche</i> in fishing EU pelagic entitlements. The vessel will be closely monitored in EU waters and ports. In any event, its primary focus will be to continue to be elsewhere and to fish off west Africa.</p>

      <b>Mr. Broughan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       if he will make a statement on the BBC's decision to opt for the Freesat unencrypted satellite transmission platform, the resulting grave concerns of Irish broadcasters and the likely impact of this development on the proposed Irish digital terrestrial television platform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_585">As the Minister said in reply to Question No. 186 of 29 May 2003, he is considering the implications from a range of perspectives of the BBC's decision to offer its service on unencrypted satellite. The BBC's decision, especially if other UK terrestrial broadcasters follow suit, has implications for Irish television audiences, Irish broadcasters and for those who sell television services in the Irish market. The decision will also have implications for any new proposals for the roll-out of DTT services in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Minister is at present exploring options for the introduction of DTT in Ireland. When deciding how to proceed I will take account of the recent experience in the UK following the launch of the free view DTT service. He will also take account of the decision of the BBC to offer its services on unencrypted satellite.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The BBC's decision should be seen in the context of an industry which is undergoing major structural change as a result of advances in technology. It has long been recognised that advances in digital technology would increase the number of channels available to viewers and introduce more competition in the broadcasting distribution sector. Viewers will continue to be offered more choice in terms of television programmes services and how they receive those services.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Since the BBC announced its decision to go "in the clear" on satellite the Minister has had discussions with representatives of the industry in Ireland on its implications. He will shortly meet representatives of both the broadcasters and platform operators to give them a further opportunity to outline their concerns and to listen to their view on what action, if any, should be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Does this decision by Greg Dyke and the BBC not place RTE in the worst catch-22 situation it could possibly find itself and facing the worst crisis in its history? Does the Minister of State accept that when the BBC's eight channels go on the free Astra service, the footprint of which includes this island and the island of Britain, it will be possible for any subscriber here to have all those British channels and, most likely, ITV, other British channels and up to 100 international channels free of charge following a once-off payment of perhaps €300? RTE will, therefore, be in a catch-22 situation. Will it go on the Astra service itself along with the BBC? RTE will not be in the number one slot which BBC England will almost certainly occupy. Even BBC Scotland, BBC Wales and BBC Northern Ireland are concerned about that. If it goes on the Astra service, what happens to its programme rights? Effectively, somebody in northern England or in Edinburgh will be able to view any American series free of charge? Will RTE then not have to pay up to ten times the price it now pays for viewing rights? Is RTE not behind the eight ball?</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Is the Minister, who is not here again today, not lethargic in not immediately going to see the Culture Secretary or whoever is responsible in the UK Government to try to thrash this out? I urge the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to take this issue seriously, which he has not done so far, and to meet RTE and TV3 executives and those at the highest levels of the British Government to see if we can ensure public service broadcasting in this country is protected. Is it not a disastrous situation?</p>

          <p eId="para_594">We share the Deputy's concerns. Obviously, there are a number of potential negative impacts on RTE and TV3 – for example, Irish viewers may choose the Freesat option and not switch back to RTE or TV3, UK terrestrial broadcasters may acquire rights for Irish markets and loss of audience share will result in fall of income. Of course, there are serious implications for RTE. The Minister has had meetings with RTE and TV3 to hear their views on the BBC move.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">The matter was also discussed at a recent meeting with Chorus. IBEC has requested a meeting on behalf of its cable and industry broadcasting group and that meeting will be arranged shortly. The Minister decided to initiate discussions with the industry to get its views on how to move forward. The difficulty is that the Television Without Frontiers Directive is designed to encourage the free transmission of television broadcast from one member state to another subject to minimum standards in relation to advertising, sponsorship and the protection of minors. The only situation in which a member state can seek the suspension of a television service is in the case of repeated breaches of provisions relating to the protection of minors. Under the current regulatory regime, Ireland cannot stop, or seek to stop, the BBC from broadcasting on unencrypted satellite services.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I share the Deputy's view, as does the Minister, that it is a difficulty which must be addressed. The Minister is addressing it in conjunction with the industry and I hope a conclusion will be arrived at. It is important that the views of the industry are ascertained as quickly as possible. I do not think I will be taking over the Minister's job. The Minister is trying to see if he can resolve the difficulties with the Irish Box and that is why he is not here. He is certainly on top of this situation and has already initiated meetings. There will be meetings in the coming weeks to try to resolve this issue.</p>

      <b>Mr. Eamon Ryan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the projected timetable for the establishment of a buy-out of commercial driftnetting licences for salmon; and if he will introduce an individual non-transferable quota for the commercial salmon fishermen in conjunction with such a buy-out.
      [16105/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_502">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_603">For some time, the Government has ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and instead promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instruments available to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The issues inherent in a complete voluntary buy-out of the commercial salmon sector are very complex. The international experience is mixed. We need to caution against excessive raising of expectation about large amounts of compensation. It is not the case that all active commercial salmon fishermen are willing to be bought out. As has been said on many occasions, simplistic solutions will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Central Fisheries Board has recently published the Indecon report, An Economic/Socio-Economic Evaluation of Wild Salmon in Ireland, which provides, through the employment of extensive new survey research, an up-to-date estimation of the economic and socio-economic value of the commercial and recreational salmon fishing sectors. I have asked the Central Fisheries Board to obtain the views of the stake holders with a view to identifying areas of consensus and report to me on the completion of that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Pending the outcome of this report, I remain to be convinced about buy-outs as cost-efficient, workable instruments. I am advised that the sub-committee of the National Salmon Commission, which was set up to review the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, presented its findings for the first time at yesterday's meeting of the commission. I understand it makes certain recommendations aimed at delivering significant rationalisation of categories and the numbers of commercial licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I have asked the National Salmon Commission, when considering its advice to me on these recommendations, to deliberate on the question of allocating non-transferable quotas to individual licences. I have also asked the national fisheries managers executive to examine the proposals and to report to me with its views on the changes recommended as quickly as possible. Subject to the emerging advice, it is my intention that any changes will be made for the 2004 fishing season.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_503">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_608">One of the problems I have is that the report the Minister of State received from the Central Fisheries Board from Indecon was available prior to the final decision being made in this year's season. It is important that we stop talking about compensation and do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The central recommendation of the Indecon report refers not only to the need to have a compulsory buy-out of all commercial driftnetting licences for salmon, but of the need to bring about a major reduction in the commercial impact on the remaining salmon stocks, particularly in respect of the outer sea driftnetting fishermen, who are non-discriminatory in terms of which salmon they take. On that basis, I support the report's conclusion that we should introduce a voluntary programme of buy-outs of licences but this should include a non-transferrable quota. Any system involving voluntary buy-outs that does not have a non-transferrable quota will lead to circumstances in which the remaining licence holders will just increase their catches, thus not producing the desired reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The Minister of State seems to be suggesting that we go to the industry to ask it what it thinks. Would it not be more appropriate for the Government to stand up and say it believes it to be of greater economic interest to reduce the commercial catch, establish non-transferrable quotas and provide for a buy-out system, even if there is compensation? It is quite clear from the Indecon report that the return to the State, in terms of economic development and angling, leisure and other industries, would far exceed the cost of the commercial buy-out.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Minister of State should stop sitting on the fence and outline to the commercial fishermen what everyone knows will happen in the longer term because we cannot allow the continued depletion of the stocks. Internationally, we are regarded as the last country to address this issue and there is huge pressure on us to change the manner in which we blindly react to this severe problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">When does the Minister believe he will reach a decision? Will he leave it until April or May next year or will he give fishermen sufficient advance notice to arrange their affairs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_504">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_613">It is certainly not a question of sitting on the fence. When I was allocated responsibility for inland fisheries, I asked the Central Fisheries Board to produce an independent consultant's report. This report, the Indecon report, is certainly wide-ranging and makes very good suggestions in respect of very good ideas. It would be wrong of me to make decisions based on a consultant's report without consulting the people involved in the fishing industry, whether it is in respect of commercial fishing, angling or angling tourism. We have asked the Central Fisheries Board, through the regional fisheries boards, to have discussions with the stake-holders and to report back as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Northern Ireland and the north-east of England are considering a buy-out and the cost of buying out up to 56 licence holders is expected to be £3.2 million. Even if we were to go down this road, it would be difficult to find the money. I have dealt with trap net fishermen on the River Slaney for years. Deputy Keogh lives among them and will be aware that some would want a buy-out and others would not. It is important that we make a decision in the interests of the country, tourism, angling and the commercial fishermen. The decisions I make will be made early in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">When I became Minister of State I found that many of the decisions on tagging and the issuing of licences were made without sufficient time being given to the people concerned. I hope any decisions made will be made early in 2004 before the fishing season begins.</p>

I take on board what the Deputy is saying. We will make decisions and will do so in the best interests of everyone concerned.</p>

      <b>Mr. Coveney</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the strategy being adopted by him to secure the continuation of existing restrictions within the Irish box fish conservation area.
      [16104/03]

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_621">While the Irish box issue is a highly contentious and complex one, an overriding conservation dimension must be considered. The continuing need for conservation of fish stocks is, accordingly, the primary factor underpinning our strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The Deputy will be aware that intensive discussions have been held in recent months with both the Greek Presidency and with Commissioner Fischler. In these discussions, we have consistently emphasised the biological sensitivity of fishing grounds around Ireland, on which Irish fishermen are highly dependent. We have also reiterated the importance of preventing an increase in fishing effort in our waters and particularly the need to prevent a northerly migration of fishing effort into the Irish box.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">We have backed up these core conservation messages with detailed scientific data from the Marine Institute. Further discussion will be held at tomorrow's Fisheries Council meetin in Luxembourg. The Commission's proposal of last December, which proposed the elimination of the Irish box, remains on the table. Ireland completely rejects it and will do so again tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Tomorrow's Council meeting will also consider a Presidency proposal which provides for special conservation measures in a sensitive area to the south and west of Ireland. The extent to which this proposal is a move away from the Commission's approach represents a measure of progress and demonstrates that our strategy of keeping this issue focused on the need to protect stocks is working. I cannot pre-empt the outcome of tomorrow's discussions other than to assure the Deputy that the need to protect fish stocks around our coast will remain the guiding policy principle.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_625">Does the Minister of State think it of benefit to the Minister that the European Parliament voted last week, at a rate of three to one, in favour of the retention of the Irish box? Has he been using that as a political tool to try to persuade the Commission to reconsider its proposals? What is the Minister's view on the compromise proposal now on the table in regard to the Irish Box, whereby it would be more than halved in size? What is being proposed is that the new box would only cover areas south and east of Wexford and south and west of Galway, the south-west coast to the south coast. Does this not leave the fishermen of the north-west coast, who have already been hammered under the common fisheries policy proposals, even more exposed? Will the Minister assure the House, and fishermen throughout the country, that he will not sell out the north-west and northern coasts in regard to ending the restrictions in place within the Irish Box to date?</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Will the Minister of State publish the legal advice of the Attorney General in regard to the position Ireland has taken on the Irish Box? Will he confirm that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, gave an instruction last December to the Department of Defence to take "a cautious approach towards enforcement within the Irish Box"? Will he confirm that if more than the 40 Spanish fishing vessels, which are allowed on a restricted basis into the Irish Box, had come into the box, they would not have been detained or arrested because of the Minister's instruction? Can he confirm that this "softly, softly" approach towards the Irish Box, and enforcement within it over the past six months, has weakened our position from a negotiation point of view?</p>

          <p eId="para_634">In regard to the other issues, the Minister has gone to Europe this afternoon. He is meeting members of the industry and officials and the Council meeting will be held tomorrow. The new proposal, or compromise proposal, on the table is coming under fire from Spain, Portugal and France. It does not have the total support of the Commission and in that event cannot be adopted by qualified majority. If the Commission maintains its opposition, adoption can only happen if there is unanimity between the member states. Obviously, there is no chance of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The main element of the suggested new approach is the concession of a sensitive zone on the southern and western coasts of Ireland where fishing effort would be restricted to current levels. While elements of the new proposal have moved significantly from the proposal presented at the December Council, it still falls far short of Ireland's demands on the issue. The Minister has not accepted the compromise proposals. He has met with the Greek Commissioner and has had meetings with the Italian Minister, whose country will take over the Presidency shortly. He has briefed the industry here and assured it that he will continue to argue its case. Discussions on Thursday for a new proposal are likely to be fraught and difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Given the level and scale of opposition to what is on the table, there is no certainty whatsoever that the current proposal, or any proposal reasonably close to it, will travel. The discussion may well remain un-concluded tomorrow and could run into the Italian Presidency. The Minister is not happy with the new proposals and will argue that case tomorrow. I welcome the support of Deputies Coveney and Broughan and others who support the Minister and the Irish position.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">On 21 February 2003, in accordance with section 13 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 (No. 20 of 2002), the Minister issued a set of policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation, including one relating to flat rate Internet access. The purpose of the policy direction on flat rate Internet access is to ensure that the Commission for Communications Regulation makes use of its powers as appropriate to facilitate the early introduction of retail flat rate Internet access services.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Given the importance attached to the introduction of retail flat rate Internet access services in Ireland, the Minister instructed the Commission for Communications Regulation to report to him on progress made in relation to this matter within one month of the issue of the direction, and on a monthly basis thereafter until such time as retail services are introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The Commission for Communications Regulation has issued a series of directions to, and with respect to, Eircom, with the objective of paving the way for the introduction of retail flat rate Internet access services in the Irish market by the end of June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I am pleased to state that the Commission for Communications Regulation has reported that the introduction of retail flat rate Internet access services by the end of June is on course. The Minister is confident that there is sufficient interest among operators in the product to ensure that retail prices will be pitched at a competitive level, thus allowing for a greater number of people to avail of the product and maximising the benefit for all users of the product.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The Minister has no function in the determination of the cost structure of the service. This is a matter for the providers of the service and the Commission for Communications Regulation.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">While the introduction of FRIACO is a valuable initiative, although belated in comparison with the United Kingdom which we are three years behind, is the Minister of State concerned that products now on the market, such as the iStream product from Eircom, result in a lot of complaints? In particular, people who try to purchase this product, which is widely advertised in the media, find that although their exchange is ADSL-enabled they still cannot get it. Is it not remarkable that Eircom, the incumbent, does not seem to have any plans to enable the bulk of its exchanges before the end of next year?</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Last week the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources held an intensive hearing into our broadband deficit which is emerging as the key infrastructural deficit in regard to the national plan. It is an issue neither the Minister nor the media, with the exception of a few dedicated journalists, has taken seriously. Table after table presented during the committee hearing showed Ireland at the bottom of the league in line with Greece. Twelve or 15 countries such as Belgium, with a 42% broadband take-up, were ahead of us. There is great demand for broadband. ComReg proved with its survey last year that 45% of people would go for a flat rate broadband package if the broadband infrastructure existed. Has the Department not reneged on its commitment in the programme for Government to DSL and broadband enable the country?</p>

We have seen the fruits of that throughout the country. I am aware of some of the complaints raised by the Deputy as I have received some. The price must be decided between the service providers and the Commission for Communications Regulation. I have heard that a figure of about €1 per day might be the starter package envisaged.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_650">Provisional figures for 2002 show the shares of fuel used for electricity generation were as follows: coal, 28%; peat, 14%; oil, 18%; natural gas, 37%; and renewables, 3%. The question of changing the role of coal in our fuel mix for electricity generation stems primarily from concerns about its environmental impact. The national climate change strategy, NCCS, points out that the closure of Moneypoint and its replacement with combined cycle gas-fired power generation would contribute to 60% of the energy sector's indicative reductions total and 37% of the total NCCS target. Moneypoint, therefore, has the potential to make a large contribution to Ireland's Kyoto commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">However, the NCCS also recognises that losing coal from our electricity generation fuel mix would have serious implications for fuel diversity. Replacement with gas would see the electricity sector reliant on gas for 80% of its production capacity by 2010. This level of reliance on a single fuel would contrast unfavourably with the rest of Europe, which, on average, would be 30% reliant on gas in the same timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Taking account of our peripherality to future gas supplies, it will be necessary for the Government to consider carefully whether the move from a reasonably diverse fuel mix for electricity generation to one of such a high dependence on gas would be prudent. If it is decided to retain coal in the energy mix, this will require major investment to upgrade Moneypoint. These important decisions must be taken within the next six to nine months. In so far as Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol are concerned, the introduction of emissions trading under the EU scheme from 2005 is recognised as one of the flexibility mechanisms which will enable countries to attain compliance with Kyoto obligations at the least cost.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_653">The Minister seems to be saying that it would be undesirable for Ireland to become totally reliant on gas. That being the case, the future of Moneypoint will have to be carefully studied before a decision is made. However, is it not the case that, despite the announcement this morning in a hostelry near this House of Eirtricity's major development in regard to the Arklow Bank, the effort being made by this country in regard to renewables is still pretty appalling at close to 3% of total energy supplies? There was a committee discussion yesterday on the issue of getting the cost structure of renewable energy sources, especially wind, down from its current levels by 2016, and that is the approach I favour. Is not critical, therefore, that under the AER IV or future programmes, the Minister has a responsibility to advance the renewables sector, including wood, in order to urgently diversify our energy mix?</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_654">When will we see the post-AER IV forum on the promotion of renewable energy as promised by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in a speech some months ago? When will we see the contracts, which are being considered at present, granted under the current AER IV programme? Does the Government have plans to invest in an interconnector between Ireland and Britain to connect capacity in regard to power and energy generation?</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_527">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_655">The Minister is saying that emissions trading under the European system in place until 2005 is a flexible option which would provide a solution at least cost. However, while it will provide a solution at least cost for manufacturing industry and for power generation companies in this country, it will be at a most expensive cost to the people. The Minister speaks as if the emissions trading system is an easy way out with no cost involved to anyone. Under the EU system, while quotas will be given to the companies so they will not have to pay the cost, the Irish people will have to pay a massive cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">We need to reduce emissions by about 10 million tonnes per year. Moneypoint could have reduced it by 2.5 million to 3 million tonnes but that will not now happen as is clear from the Minister's reply. Does the Minister think that the emissions trading system will be enough or is it the right way for us to deal with the problems regarding the Kyoto Protocol and our own emissions, which have increased more than any other European country?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_528">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_657">To reply to Deputy Broughan, I accept that renewable energy is an area which needs to be driven. While I will answer later on the AER IV programme, we would hope to make speedy decisions in that area. I am pointing out some of the difficulties involved if Ireland was to convert totally to gas. There are three possible options for Moneypoint: a coal-burning facility, refitted to comply with EPA licensing; the conversion of the existing facility to gas burning, though it is unlikely that this would be economical; or to replace the facility with combined cycle gas turbine generating capacity, probably on the same site for grid reasons. The ESB is at present considering all aspects of the future of Moneypoint with a view to making a firm proposal to Government in the coming months. A large investment – close to €200 million – would be required to upgrade the station to meet with EPA licensing requirements and to keep the plant in operation in the long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">No decision has been made but recommendations will, I hope, shortly be put to the Minister. While there are supply difficulties in regard to converting totally to gas, Members can rest assured that all areas are being considered. The Minister and his Department will make a final decision on the matter.</p>

      asked the

       the progress which has been made with regard to his Department's consideration of the recent consultants' report on the Irish Coast Guard; if it is intended to implement the recommendations made in the report; the reason the central rescue co-ordination has been transferred from Dublin to Valentia; if this is intended to be a permanent move; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_531">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_662">The consultants' report in question contains recommendations relating to both the strategic development of the Coast Guard service and day-to-day operations. The strategic issues include, for example, matters relating to the future operation of the three marine co-ordination centres in Dublin, Malin and Valentia. As I informed the House in April of this year, consideration of these issues will also have regard to a wider review that I am undertaking at this time of the organisational structures and operational arrangements within my Department. My overall objective is to improve services delivery across the board, and I expect to be in a position to complete consideration of the matters relating to the Coast Guard shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Work on assessing and, as appropriate, implementing recommendations which relate to the day-to-day operations of the Coast Guard service is also in hand. A working group of the Department's partnership committee, which comprises management and staff interests, has been considering the recommendations. Over one third of the approximately 100 recommendations made by the consultants have already been accepted and are in the course of being implemented.  Consideration of the remaining recommendations will continue over the coming weeks and months. The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, Dublin, staff and functions were transferred to the Valentia and Malin Head centres in May 2003, to enable asbestos to be removed from ceilings of two of the five floors of the building where they were located in Leeson Lane. The asbestos has now been removed and arrangements are in hand to enable the MRCC, Dublin, staff to return to Leeson Lane this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">I thank the Minister of State for his explanation of the move from Leeson Lane.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">In view of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, what is the current position with regard to Valentia and Malin? There is grave uncertainty about the coastguard operation in Malin and its impact on the Inishowen Peninsula in north east Donegal where the unemployment rate is 17%. Does the Minister of State agree that one of the core problems which must be addressed from the report's recommendations is whether to reduce the service from a three centre command to two? Can he assure the House that the concerns about Malin and Inishowen are misplaced and that the three location command structure will continue? Does the Minister of State further agree that, given the major pollution problems we face on our sea lanes, it is critical we have this three centre command structure?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_533">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_666">As the Deputy said, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report was wide-ranging and made a huge number of recommendations. In general, the report found that the coastguard services are excellent. It recommended that the IRCG should continue to provide its current functions and services. However, the most controversial recommendation refers to reducing the number of control centres from three to two and establishing the IRCG as an agency. Advances in communications have obviated the necessity for three centres and savings from the closure of one centre, estimated at €500,000<i>per annum,</i> could be used to develop other aspects of the coastguard service. The report does not recommend which centre should be closed. In deciding on whether the coastguard should be established as an agency, the future costs of the maritime safety directive also need to be considered, as well as the general structure of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister has said for some time that he is examining the recommendations with regard to the three centres, as well as the possibility of developing an agency, rather than the service remaining within the Department.</p>

      <b>Mr. Cuffe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the arrangements commercial salmon fishermen should follow when they return to port with salmon in excess of the number of tags they had on board; the arrangements they should make if due to telecommunications difficulties they are unable at the time to contact the relevant fishery board officers; and the frequency with which the commercial salmon log books have to be returned for examination by the fishery board officers.
      [16012/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_541">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_675">I recently signed regulations revising the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme for 2003. These regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the surrender of captured wild salmon or sea trout where tags and quotas are exhausted and the delivery of completed logbooks and unused tags to the chief executive officer of the regional fisheries board.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Under the regulations, the chief executive officer of the regional board is charged with the statutory responsibility and accountability to manage and operate the tagging scheme. In order to ensure a consistency of approach and equitable distribution of tags in each district, I have asked the Central Fisheries Board to issue guidelines for the implementation of the scheme to the chief executive officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I am advised that under these guidelines, a fisherman returning to land with untagged fish must notify either the regional fisheries board office or a fisheries board officer whose mobile telephone number will be available, informing the board that he has returned to port with untagged fish. While the fish should be left on board the vessel until the fisheries board officer arrives, the fisherman may, however, leave the boat should it prove necessary to use a land telephone line to contact either the regional fisheries board or its officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Where a fisherman runs out of tags, but more are available to be issued within the limits of the district and sectoral quota, the fisheries board will make arrangements to issue further tags to the licence holder. Where there are no more tags available to be issued within the limits of the quota, the untagged fish must be surrendered to the fisheries board in accordance with the regulations. I understand that under the regulations, completed commercial salmon logbooks must be returned to the chief executive officer of the regional board within seven days of the end of the relevant fishing season.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_542">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_679">I asked this question to illustrate the difficulties with the current tagging arrangements. Despite the best efforts and intentions of many people involved in the industry, the Minister of State will agree that, under this type of system, there will be instances when it will be impossible to apply, there will be anomalies, people will break the rules and some will ply their trade on the black market. The problem with the tagging system is that it is complicated and difficult to implement. A more straightforward system could involve either a non-transferrable quota – where one gets the tags in advance – or a complete buy-out. This reiterates an argument I made earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">One of the major problems is that, while we discuss these regulations, the staff and budget allocated the fisheries boards in order for them to implement the policy has been cut, as we saw in yesterday's Estimates. Despite our talk about protecting and preserving the resources we have, we are cutting back on the necessary staff. Some five people, who would have been applying this system, were laid off from the Southern Regional Fisheries Board last week. How does the Minister of State measure all the regulations, tagging systems, given the cutbacks his Department has made?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_543">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_681">To a certain extent, the Deputy is correct to say there were abuses of the system – particularly in the first year. We asked the chief executive officers of the fisheries boards and the salmon commission to look at possible changes for 2003 compared with 2002 and a number of those changes were implemented. I had a number of meetings with fishermen from the commercial and angling sectors as well as representatives from the industry generally and few of them are happy with the new regulations. However, we took advice from stake holders on the ground and changed some of the rules. They are reasonably happy with the system that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The Deputy referred to cutbacks. However, there have been few cutbacks to the inland fisheries sector. The chief executive officers have assured me they have the manpower and finances to monitor the different districts. To find a system that is 100% foolproof is difficult. Every fisherman I meet will say he is in favour of conservation, but not in his area. We must trust, as far as possible, that they will adhere to the guidelines as laid down by the Department and signed into regulation by me. I can see difficulties with some of the areas and I acknowledge we had teething problems last year. Nonetheless, we resolved some of those problems this year and I am sure that next year, in conjunction with a review by the salmon commission and the chief executive officers, we will examine further possible changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">One of the recommendations made by the salmon commission was that logbooks should be returned every 14 days during the season. The fishermen were not happy with this and we made changes. It is working reasonably well from the information I am receiving. Last year many fishermen over-fished and returned with more fish than they were supposed to catch and yet no decision was taken to take them off or remove them, which defeated the purpose of conservation. We have tried to deal with that issue this year by requiring fishermen to report to the chief executive officer if they exceed their allocated tag numbers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_544">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_684">One of the other problems of the existing system – where fishermen only get tags when they have used up existing ones – is that it forces certain fishermen out into rough weather and dangerous conditions, because they know if they do not get out, they might not get their share of the regional quota. In this we have created a dangerous situation. That is another argument in favour of an individual non-transferrable quota.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_545">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_685">The non-transferrable quota will be examined later this year and any changes will be made in 2004. I accept, however, that there are problems with safety. This year, we gave four safety days at the end of the season because the safety days last year during the season were widely abused – they were used for family occasions such as first communions or weddings. This year we have moved them to the end of the season but I am not happy about safety days or chief executive officers telling a fisherman that he cannot have one and he must go out. We must re-examine the issue when the season is finished. It places a heavy onus on the chief executive officer to make a decision.</p>

          <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_686">Is the Minister of State happy with the veracity of the statistics on which the quotas are based? Some areas have a later run of salmon than others. The number of tags that go out at the start of the season do not necessarily reflect the number of fish caught. There can be cases at the end of the year where some people have drawers full of tags while others have been unable to catch salmon because the quota was used up by those people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_547">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_687">The quota system was based on a combination of scientific advice, recommendations from the Salmon Commission and striking a balance to ensure the best for the fishermen. This year the chief executive officers made a decision to issue a small number of tags based on the catch last year and if the tags were not used, no more were issued. Last year people were getting the tags all season but not fishing. This year only a certain number of tags were issued and if people do not fish, they do not get any more tags, they are given to other people. That is the way the chief executive officers are supposed to operate the scheme. If the Deputy finds that is not the case, she can bring it to my attention and we will discuss it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_691">The European Network and Information Security Agency is a proposal by the European Commission to establish a European centre of expertise on network and information security issues and thereby enhance the capability of the Union and the member states to deal with problems in this area. As we become increasingly dependent on computer and communications networks, the secure functioning of these networks is of key concern to us all in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The member states are currently working with the Commission to finalise the current text of the regulation to establish the agency. This must then go before the European Parliament. It is expected that a Common Position will be reached on it by the end of the year with a view to the agency beginning its work in the first half of 2004. It is envisaged that the agency will have a staff of about 30.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The current focus is on defining the exact functions and structures of the agency. The question of where it is to be located has not yet been discussed at European level. At the appropriate time it will be an issue to be decided at a high level in Europe and will probably happen in the context of the locating of a number of other EU bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The primary focus of the Digital Hub is to attract private investment, both from the international and indigenous sectors. However, it is also important going forward that efforts are made to attract other projects into the Digital Hub, and the country as a whole, in order to maintain our drive to move our ICT sector up the value chain. It will be in this context that we will continue to monitor progress on the establishment of the agency closely.</p>

          <p eId="para_695">It would help if we could finish the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill. It has been going through the Houses for a long time but we are still not on Report Stage. Is the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, actively canvassing at European level to ensure this agency will be based in this country, in the hub in particular? It would be the second such major agency after the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which is based in Loughlinstown. Does the Minister of State agree that it would be very important, given that the private sector investment we expected for the hub that was originally pitched at €10 million per year is far below that level, with many important companies pulling out of the original project due to the way it was managed by the Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The Minister of State will be aware of the likely work of the agency. Recently many books were published marking the centenary of George Orwell's birth. Is it true that all of the data traffic retention information could be stored in the Liberties? Has the Minister of State or the Minister given any thought to the grave concerns about the current proposals on data traffic retention which elements of the media and journalists such as Karlin Lillington have highlighted in recent months, that, in reaction to 11 September, we have gone way over the top and we are envisaging a <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> or <i>Animal Farm</i> type society which would not be in the interests of democracy?</p>

          <p eId="para_697">At a meeting of the EU Telecoms Council in June, which I attended, the regulations received informal political approval and have now been referred to the European Parliament for discussion. It is anticipated that the agency will come into being in the first half of 2004. The majority of member states feel that ENISA should only have a consultative and advisory role as opposed to any operational responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The criteria for location of the agency are that it must be easily accessible in terms of communication, especially electronic communication, have effective and fast transport connections enabling the agency to work closely and efficiently with those institutions and services that deal with network and information security services or issues, be cost effective, enable the agency to start its work immediately and provide the necessary infrastructure and personnel of the agency. I can assure the Deputy, that the Minister and I will fight to secure this agency for Ireland. The decision could be made on where this and other agencies are located during Ireland's Presidency, which should work in our favour.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 108 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">As Deputies will be aware from my replies to previous questions on this matter, an assessment of the feasibility of developing an offshore wind farm in the Tunes Plateau area, off the mouth of Lough Foyle, is being carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">This assessment is being undertaken by a consortium comprised of Renewable Energy Systems, B9 Offshore Energy and Powergen. I understand it is at an advanced stage and is scheduled to be completed within the next few months. I am advised also that the consortium is preparing an environmental impact statement in respect of the possible development of a wind farm, taking account of the feasibility assessment and other studies they have undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">My Department became aware last year that the feasibility assessment was under way, and examined the situation in detail in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General. Following this examination, the consortium, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the Crown Estates Commission, were notified that the development of a wind farm at the location in question may only be carried out in accordance with the terms of a foreshore lease granted under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">It will be a matter for the consortium to determine, taking account of the results of the studies and investigations they have undertaken, whether they wish to proceed with applications for the necessary statutory consents for the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Any application that the consortium may make for authorisation for the development of a wind farm would have to be accompanied by a comprehensive environmental impact statement addressing the likely environmental effects of the proposed development. Any such application would be considered in detail on its objective merits, and interested parties would have an opportunity to express their views on the proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">In the meantime, my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the Attorney General in addressing matters relating to the proposed development. Contacts with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom are ongoing.</p>

Since I have seen a computer generated model of the 85 x 30 storey turbines, each of which will be the size of the pyramids of Egypt, and will see them from my house I declare my interest. Is the Minister aware of the number of conservation groups and councils on a cross-party, cross-Border basis of all political shades from Gregory Campbell through to some of the Sinn Féin members who may be taking part in the gambit? Our car ferry has recently been started. The infrastructure at that point on an SAC at MacGilligan took years of studies to overcome just putting a couple of bits of cement on either side of the Foyle. We now have a possibility of 85 x 30 storey turbines being located there. What voice do we have versus £250 million sterling worth of big business coming in looking for green credits for polluter pay sorting out in some other region, as I understand this is really what it is about? What rights do we have as the people in the area, who have had a salmon fishery of 40,000 a short time ago. We have a real salmon fishery and we have plans to develop an even better salmon fishery in the Foyle plus other marine issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">I am aware Deputy Keaveney and other Deputies have been active on this issue for some time. The Government and the Departments have been very pro-active also. Once the feasibility study became known to the Department, it was examined by this Department in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the Attorney General. It was decided that no development could take place unless the project was authorised by way of a foreshore lease under the Foreshore Acts and the consortium was advised accordingly. We are also aware of the interest shown by local groups and persons in the north west who have expressed much concern about the salmon area, coastal erosion implications, visual impact and the effects on fisheries and navigation. All these issues will have to be addressed in the EIS being prepared by the consortium. Any application for foreshore approval for the development of a wind farm will be subject to rigorous scrutiny by the marine licensing vetting committee which comprises technical experts from a range of relevant disciplines. There would also be an opportunity for interested persons and bodies to examine the proposal. My Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General have been working in unison on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_573">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_732">The dramatic expansion development and transformation of ICT continues to depend on wide-ranging research in several areas, such as science, software systems and technology. Nevertheless, current and ongoing research will constantly strive to further push out the frontiers of knowledge in pursuit of ICT of the future. Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate that Science Foundation Ireland should seek and fund imaginative proposals for ICT related research in areas such as software applications, components and devices and network development. This would include areas like high speed broadband, next generation mobile transmission and wireless voice data and video transmission.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">In a recent speech, Dr. William Harris, Director General of Science Foundation Ireland quoted the US Science Foundation as a model for the new foundation and for future potential of research in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The National Science Foundation was largely instrumental in developing the speciality of computer science, inspiring a generation of idealistic thinkers to pursue basic research into this relatively new area.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Computer infrastructures were provided at almost all US universities throughout the country, enabling development of endowed faculties which are contributing to America's well of talent and discovery in this area. Science Foundation Ireland can make a similar contribution to research programmes in Ireland and our brightest and best students can be enticed to pursue and explore research opportunities at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Dr. Harris' vision of a thriving ecosystem of research excellence in Ireland is imminently attainable. The future generations of students who are inspired to pursue research possibilities in science and engineering will form the nucleus of Ireland's future advances in these disciplines.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">In the past, Ireland's commitment to science and technology has lagged behind that of other countries, though the base from which these sectors increased was lower. A 2001 Forfás report stated that Ireland's rate of investment was five times below New Zealand's and half that of Sweden. In a worrying trend, the numbers of leaving certificate students taking physics and chemistry continues to decline. Solutions are required from Government, industry and educators to persuade students to pursue careers in science. Radical reform of science and technology education is urgently required and the negative perception of careers in these areas must be addressed by industry. Current scientific discovery continues to excite and it is not beyond the ingenuity of educators to make physical science subjects cool despite the fact that they are regarded as boring and difficult. Hopefully, this generation can be developed as science and technology trend setters and leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">It is urgent that we attain leadership in this field to help our brightest and best to specialise in an area which has so much potential to benefit the country. The inclusion of science in the curriculum should be emphasised at primary and second levels while encouraging science-related projects during transition year.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I note with satisfaction that science has been given greater emphasis in the new primary school curriculum. This can only benefit science generally. However, the condition of many schools is cause for concern as they have become seriously dilapidated and breach health and safety regulations. Developing science and technology centres of excellence is all very well, but it should be remembered that these grandiose concepts emanate from primary school classrooms. Many of these are housed in inadequate buildings which leave much to be desired where the safe storage of equipment is concerned. I note that the Department of Education and Science has undergone a type of Pauline conversion in responding to pressure by adding a total of 110 minor repair works to its increasingly unreliable list. This is akin to patching up major cracks with tissue paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">It is vital that this exciting new departure in science is adequately resourced and fully supported by the Government well into the future. We are not too far removed from an era in which science teachers were compelled to improvise by using ink wells containing methylated spirits and wicks in place of Bunsen burners as a result of the failure of previous Governments to properly resource science teaching. If sufficient funds are not forthcoming, the entire project will be undermined and stillborn. If it is to be subject to the moderation in the rates of increase of which we have seen numerous examples in the current year, I shudder to think of its viability.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Science has been described as the design or conduct of reproducible experiments to test how nature works or as the creation of theories which can themselves be tested by such experiments. Science is the one human activity which seeks knowledge in an organised manner. It is not the knowledge which is organised, it is the search for it. Science does not guess, nor does it hope, wish, trust or believe; science seeks. It is the search which makes science so exciting. Seeking is a uniquely humble human experience. Science does not say "I know", it says "I need to find out". What other human enterprise has its non-judgmental, non-directive attributes and its quiet dignity? The best of this enterprise is found in research which is a basic search for truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I trust that this Bill will enhance the respect society has for science and the scientific bent of mind and its willingness to support these, particularly at the level of scientific research. I welcome this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_574">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_743">I noted earlier in the debate that Deputy Finian McGrath took issue with the name of the body to be established through this legislation. It is a pity that an organisation called Science Foundation Ireland is to ignore the Six Counties. There does not appear to be any sign of an all-Ireland dimension to the organisation. Perhaps the Minister will indicate if such a dimension is proposed when she responds.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">While I welcome the legislation broadly, the comments of one of the organisations which might have been expected to welcome most the investment in scientific research Science Foundation Ireland represents should be noted. The Irish Research Scientists Association welcomes, as I do, the investment the Government is making in science, but it has expressed difficulties with the mechanisms and priorities of the funding. The bulk of scientific investment will be made in universities through Science Foundation Ireland and the programme for investment in third level institutions which is run by the Higher Education Authority. The amount of money available for capital investment for the latter funding programme is a casualty of the Government's cutbacks and many projects and schemes in the research sector have been left in a kind of limbo. Perhaps in her reply, the Minister will assess what she believes the implications may be for Science Foundation Ireland and science in general if that funding remains discontinued. Many of the projects to be funded by Science Foundation Ireland and through the programme for investment tend to be large with a great number of staff employed. There does not seem to be a reasonable amount of money set aside for smaller projects. The IRSA has repeatedly made the point that there is a case for greater diversification of funding to permit investment in scientific research projects run by small groups or individuals. Is the Minister putting too many eggs in one basket?</p>
          <p eId="para_745">What are the implications for Science Foundation Ireland once the national development plan has come to full fruition? The Government is to be commended for its investment in research, even if we are starting from a low base in historical terms. Our current spending on research is 1.2% of GDP which is one of the lowest rates in the EU. Does the Minister believe the EU target of 3% of GDP is feasible for this State given the Government's current spending difficulties? Science Foundation Ireland is to focus on bio-technology and information and communications technology and not on other areas of science. The Minister stated in her speech that those areas were identified as representing the main future engines of growth in the global economy. While I accept that there is a good deal of merit in the point she makes, I ask what she believes would be the implications for the foundation and this State of heavy investment in those areas if the analysis were to change. Could we not invest in research into wind energy? Why is there an emphasis on purely economic benefits rather than on the greater benefits which might accrue to society and scientific research through investment in social or environmental research?</p>
          <p eId="para_746">There seem to be few safeguards in the legislation regarding the research institutes which are to receive money. How can we be sure that all of them have the social and environmental interests of the people at heart? The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for issuing military and dual-use export licences, 59 of which were issued in 2001 alone. Many companies produce dual-use technology which they sell to arms manufacturers and some produce military goods which have no use other than as part of weapons systems. A proportion of these goods have ended up in countries with terrible human rights records including Turkey, Malaysia and Colombia, a country with which I have become familiar through my trips there. AFrI has regrettably pointed to a growing link between arms companies and Irish research institutes. Are these the same kind of research institutes Science Foundation Ireland is expected to bankroll?</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Irish companies such as CHEMFAB Europe, Befab Safeland in Clare, Data Device Corporation and Moog in Cork provide information and communications technologies to militaries across the world. What assurances do we have that Science Foundation Ireland will not fund research projects connected to these companies?</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_749">Will the Minister assure the House that this Government will not provide financial support to the Irish arms trade? I ask the Minister in her response to assure the House that none of the money provided to Science Foundation Ireland will be used to support scientific research connected to the Irish arms industry and the production of military goods or dual-use technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I also wish to take the opportunity offered by this rare debate on science to mention other areas of concern. Investment in third level scientific research is to be welcomed but there must be a serious attempt to tackle the problems facing the teaching of science in secondary schools. Figures suggest that students are not attracted to careers in scientific research. In 1990, 16% of leaving certificate students took chemistry but in 2002 this had fallen to 12%. Physics is another example. In 1990, 20% of students were enrolled in physics classes but this had dropped to 15.6% by 2002. Another worrying development is the number of leaving certificate students ranking computing engineering courses as their first choice in CAO applications. This has fallen by 18% since 2001. This must be a concern to anybody with an interest in science.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Ireland is one of the few countries in the world that does not have a practical component in science subjects. I welcome the new junior certificate science syllabus which will feature 12 practical experiments each year. The new syllabus is ambitious when one considers that many of the schools expected to start teaching the new syllabus in September do not have science laboratories, as noted by Deputy Gregory. Teacher unions have also stated that in 40% of secondary school laboratories conditions are primitive and unsafe. Yesterday the Minister for Education and Science said he believed this problem had been overcome but in reply to a parliamentary question I put to him earlier this year, he told me that neither he nor his Department knew how many secondary schools had science laboratories. There is an urgent need for investment in science education at second level.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Deputy Gregory mentioned disadvantaged schools, in which there is a huge obligation on us to invest. We also need to know where the investment mentioned in the Bill will go. I welcome the introduction of the Bill but a number of issues must be tackled.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of this Bill which establishes Science Foundation Ireland on a statutory basis. The main purpose of this body is to promote and develop world class research capabilities in certain areas of scientific endeavour which are particularly concerned with economic and social benefit and long-term competitiveness. Examples include information and communications technologies and biotechnology.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">This development is most worthwhile. Ireland today has a highly trained workforce. This is, in no small measure, a result of the developments that have occurred in third level education during the past 30 years. The number of students attending third level has increased dramatically since 1970. The growth in numbers has been achieved by the great success of the institutes of technology, formerly known as the regional technical colleges. Not only have they opened the area of third level education to a large section of the population who did not previously have the opportunity to go to university, but by offering the ladder system they have also enabled students to start at certificate level and proceed to diploma and eventually degree status.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">In addition, the range and diversity of courses in institutes of technology are such that they are firmly focused on practical career opportunities. These courses are mainly developed in close conjunction with local industry. With the resultant growth in degree courses and the increasing number of students attaining this level it is only natural that some of these students should wish to proceed to further study, either at masters or Ph.D level. This country is now reaching the stage where it has an emerging pool of people capable of research at the highest level. The universities have been producing research students for many years but the great success of the IT sector has stimulated the universities to look at and alter their postgraduate programmes with the result that they have now become more practical in focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The era of low paid unskilled jobs is now almost gone. Our citizens are well educated and demand more stimulating work situations. There is a highly trained workforce and it is imperative that research and development are encouraged across the board. Over the past 20 years a sea change has occurred in the work opportunities available to Irish people. The era of low paid work is passing as we have witnessed with the loss of many jobs in low skilled, low paid sectors of employment. Certain manufacturing industries, for example, textiles, have closed down and moved their operations to the Far and Near East where wages are low. This is due to the rapid changes that have occurred in the economy as it has moved from a Third World to a First World economy. Our population is more educated and demands better paid and more rewarding job opportunities. The third level colleges, both universities and institutes of technology, have responded and are now producing graduates who can compete at research level with the best in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Last Monday the Minister for Education and Science announced the provision of a B.Sc in archaeology at Sligo Institute of Technology. This course is the first of its kind in Ireland and will produce highly trained archaeologists who will have a high component of practical expertise. As the State continues its massive infrastructural programme in road building and so forth, the need for practical archaeologists, trained to the highest level, is self-evident. This B.Sc course is a recognition by the Minister of what the institute of technology can do. I commend both the staff at Sligo Institute of Technology for devising the course and the Minister for giving permission to the institute to proceed with the degree course.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Science Foundation Ireland is to be put on a statutory basis and charged with investing in the scientific and engineering fields underpinning biotechnology and information and communications technology. It is predicted that the market for biotechnology industries alone will rise to €250 billion by 2005 and support three million jobs in Europe. The foundation has already committed approximately €152 million in research projects and shown that the Government is committed to building an ecosystem of world class reseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I urge the Minister to ensure there is an equitable distribution of research throughout the relevant third level colleges. The institutes of technology are ideally poised to develop their already strong links with local industry and the research they are conducting is biased heavily in favour of practical results. Ireland is home to nine of the ten largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. In Sligo, Abbott Laboratories is already the largest employer and has developed close links with Sligo Institute of Technology. Its new pharmaceutical factory, due to open shortly, is closely involved with the science department of the institute in devising courses for its employees. This synergy is beneficial to all concerned. With the help and guidance of Science Foundation Ireland this must lead to the development of more detailed and penetrating research. The development of new products and jobs is the ultimate aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">I wish to suggest a new way of encouraging the development of research capabilities. I represent Sligo-Leitrim, which is part of the BMW region. I am a member of the BMW regional assembly. It is the stated aim of the Government, as expressed through the national development plan, to encourage new industry to the area. The recruitment and retention of highly qualified research staff in any area, be it at postgraduate level or up to Ph.D level or above, are dependent on many factors. The quality of the research and the interest of the researcher in the topic are obviously high on the agenda. To encourage and foster research and development in the west, specific tax incentives should be given to companies which engage in it. In particular, tax breaks should be given to individual researchers located in the BMW area. In this way, the synergy of universities and institutes of technology, the well educated workforce and the companies which engage in research can be utilised to promote the growth the Bill aspires to create. I commend this exciting legislation to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotFitzpatrickFF" eId="spk_580">
          <from>Dr. Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_763">I welcome this Bill. I begin with two quotes. The first is from a letter I received from a head teacher of a school in my constituency. He states:</p>
          <p eId="para_764">In addition to catering for the children of the community, the school also caters for transient children from the nearby hostels and children from Travelling communities. Over 70% of our children come from single-parent families and unemployment among parents is a serious problem. The results of the most recent standardised tests carried out in the school are stark. Some 33% of pupils tested in mathematics scored below the tenth percentile, which indicates that they are in need of urgent attention. The situation with regard to English is only marginally better, with 31% of the pupils scoring below the tenth percentile.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">This letter was written by the head teacher to urge the Minister for Education and Science to enable him to retain his full complement of staff. He did not want to lose any of them. I now quote from the contribution of Dr. Harris who states:</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend on establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally competitive knowledge-based economy. Such re-positioning is essential to provide sustainable, high quality, well paid jobs in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">One might think that these two quotations have no connection at all. However, they are intimately connected. Unless we put the money and the support structures into the primary schools, we will create a marginalised community and prevent bright people from getting a chance to proceed to third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">This Bill is based upon the premise that a constant stream of well educated graduates will be produced by the education system. The education system begins for people at three or four years of age and goes right through the life span. Education is a life-long business now. The days when one could close one's books and forget about them after leaving university are long over.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">As Deputy Devins said, the Bill must also be seen in the context of the changing manufacturing environment in which we live. Low-tech, high volume manufacturing has almost disappeared from the western world, the clothing industry being a major case in point. Most clothing of the average, middle range is now manufactured in the Far East, the Middle East, India and South America. Very little clothing is now manufactured in Europe, and apart from individual clothing items, the clothing manufacturing industry in Ireland has literally disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I welcome this Bill which is badly needed and long overdue. We need to pump money into scientific research because our future viability and financial well being as a country depends upon knowledge-based and science-based industries. We must continue to invest and re-invest in them as time goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Deputy Crowe made the point that the Bill is possibly lacking in an all-Ireland dimension or total Irish context. The Minister may be speaking to representatives of Science Foundation Ireland, so I suggest to him that the body could adopt as its logo the phrase "bradán feasa"– the salmon of knowledge. If I remember rightly, this is one of the oldest and earliest acknowledgements of the concept of knowledge, if not science-based knowledge, in Ireland. I welcome the Bill and wish it every success.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_581">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_772">I welcome the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland which provides a great basis for establishing this country as a world class research centre. It will strengthen our international reputation as a country that provides quality and highly skilled workers. It will make Ireland a centre for research and excellence, which will attract high quality investment and open opportunities for Irish countries in the ICT and biotechnology sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The Bill is clearly very well focused. The benefits will bring success not only in Ireland but abroad. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has stated that Ireland's increased efforts in research in these areas is one of the Government's responses to making our country more competitive on a global scale. She said that we can no longer compete on a low cost basis with cheap economies around the world and must compete on skills and innovation. I welcome this initiative by the Government but I must highlight the fact that certain Government actions and policies have undermined and threatened our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Our inflation rate is twice the EU average. Government-sanctioned price increases in essential services such as health, education, energy and telecommunications are hindering our economy. Insurance costs are spiralling out of control and there is a slowdown in infrastructural development, which is one of the most important factors in creating a competitive environment. Inflation is twice the EU average, and 85% of that increase is attributable to Government-operated services. That is very worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">It is ironic that the Tánaiste speaks about improving our competitiveness while she and her Government colleagues have made decisions that can threaten this. The fact that the Bill's provisions are very much up and running and the funding earmarked would clearly indicate that, in many ways, it was a very good Bill in the Celtic tiger era. It is very important that we do not lose our competitive edge. Regardless of what science, technology or innovation we have and irrespective of the abilities or skills of the workforce, if we are not competitive people will not come to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Science Foundation Ireland will provide a basis for the development of new enterprises and provide new opportunities at home and abroad for Irish companies involved in the research and development sector. We must look at this from a broader perspective and introduce policies to encourage the developments on which the success of Science Foundation Ireland will depend, such as entrepreneurship, which is very important. Support for people setting up their own businesses, investment in research and development, education and infrastructure are all areas we should look at. Research and development and the creation of new products is an area that the Government, through the institutes of technology, very much needs to expand. We must also encourage small enterprises to engage in research and development and promote that whole area because companies cannot afford the amount of investment needed to expand in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">We must have systems in place to support new development enterprises as they emerge. The economy has slowed down and the role of enterprise within the economy is very much threatened by the high rate of inflation and by the whole bureaucratic nature of the State. People setting up businesses find this aspect very difficult to deal with and ask themselves why they should bother. Business must be conducted more simply. The backbone of this economy was built by small companies, the hub of this economy, which employed a small number of staff and received no benefit whatsoever from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Bureaucratic barriers that slow down the pace of business must be removed and entrepreneurs must be encouraged to proceed with innovative ideas and must be rewarded for taking risks. Risk takers in this country are not looking for recognition, but what they do not need is the huge level of bureaucratic red tape. The system should be simplified.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The closure of the big companies is evidence of the importance of small companies. The Minister of State is aware that small companies are sustainable in every constituency, town and village. By and large, they work the 40 hour weekend, not the 40 hour week. Often they pay their staff first and, invariably, the employers are the last to be paid. We should never lose sight of their initiative or their level of commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Minister of State agrees with me on the need for continued investment in research and development, especially for small companies, in view of the potential for future development in Europe following the accession to the European Union of the applicant states. There is a need to build on the recognition of Irish products abroad through greater marketing, especially in the food sector where there are huge opportunities. There is much talk of the cutbacks in agriculture and the decline of farming, but there is huge potential for the development of agri-business products, which are currently under sold. We should promote the greenness of Ireland and the excellent beef, which is exported in cardboard boxes without branding to indicate it is from this country. The traceability of the merchandising and sale of beef should also be promoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Failure to act in these areas will mean that Ireland will be unable to exploit the benefits of the research capabilities it aims to develop over the next few years. I commend the Government for its heavy investment in the Institute of Technology in Sligo. It has 4,000 students under its director, Dr. Richard Thorn, and is one of the finest colleges in the country with a wide range of facilities. It has immense capabilities. It is important that when graduates leave such colleges they are given the back-up and encouragement with their careers.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">A recent Forfás report on the biotechnology and IT sectors indicates that for the period 1991-2000, Ireland has performed at or slightly above the world average. It shows that while there is a good base on which to build strong research capabilities, there is still work to be done in creating robust and sustainable research centres that are capable of competing with the best in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Ireland is part of a huge competitive marketplace. As the only English speaking country in the eurozone, it should exploit the extended European market while retaining its links with the American market. Our education system has produced some fantastic students, but it is important to ensure there is no massive exodus of the kind that occurred among the graduates of the 1980s and 1990s. We must ensure that people do not leave because of our inability to create an enterprise culture that would allow them to stay and create wealth in the regions. In this regard, it is regrettable that very few of the graduates of the Institute of Technology, Sligo, get jobs in the county or the north-west. They must travel to the east or the south. The match of innovation and technology in Sligo is among the best in the country and, given the talk of the growth of the regions, it should not be seen as necessary for graduates to leave the region to get employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">We must ensure that Ireland can continue to provide highly qualified and skilled people. It is critical that students be encouraged to go into the area of research and development. The country has a great reputation in the area of science, but more must be done to encourage students to pursue their studies in the sciences. I am pleased to note Dr. Richard Thorn's disclosure that the science faculty of the Institute of Technology, Sligo, contains 600 students.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Science subjects must not only be properly marketed to school leavers, but access to third level education must be improved to ensure that there are no barriers to entry to those wishing to take up science at third level. In addition, there must be improvements in grants to those who wish to continue to study in research and development after their primary degrees. I am pleased my party's spokesperson on education is present. She agrees on the need to develop the concept of continuing education and life long learning. This is especially important in view of the links between education and enterprise and science and technology. It is critically important for the enterprise culture that companies be encouraged in terms of their research facilities and that innovation and facilities that promote life long learning be promoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The importance to competitiveness of investment in infrastructure cannot be over-emphasised. The slow down in the roads programme and the lack of a broadband infrastructure is worrying. These must be addressed in the broader context of the need to encourage research and development in the country. Broadband must be rolled out at a quicker pace and urgent steps must be taken to hasten the implementation of the road building programme, even if it means Government borrowing. It makes no sense for the State institutions such as the National Treasury Management Agency and the pension reserve fund board to be investing in global stock exchanges when they do not invest in the massive infrastructure deficit. A report last week indicated that €760 million was lost from investments in global stock markets by the pension reserve fund board. That money would be of great help in funding the construction of improvements on the N4 to Sligo, the Sligo relief road or the western link road.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">I am in that profession and I know people pay tax from birth to death. In view of this, I would be reluctant to endorse the tolling of roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Further developments in enterprise, education and the infrastructure, alongside the work of Science Foundation Ireland will help to improve competitiveness in the ICT and biotechnology sectors. I congratulate the Minister on the Science Foundation Ireland concept. The board of directors consists of exemplary people who know their job. Regrettably, the economy is not as buoyant as it was, but I have no doubt we will get value for money from this body. However, it is critically important that the State ensures the best due diligence in monitoring the way the money is spent to ensure a return on any investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Further developments at international level are important, especially in terms of seeking new markets for innovation, research and development. Innovation must be targeted and encouraged. We must look for new businesses on a global scale and be well placed to attract foreign investment. This is achievable with the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland and, with the excellent work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, we can succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. He holds a good portfolio, especially in the area of research and development. I have no doubt he will do a good job. Enterprise Ireland and the enterprise boards, with which the Minister of State deals, have an important role. This applies to the enterprise culture and boards in every county, particularly in Sligo, where the board is doing a good job but is restricted on funding. It is important to make a link between this foundation and the enterprise boards in each county because the boards deal with the small companies, of up to ten people, and I hope that the research facility will deal with every facet of industry, from the smallest set-up to the largest. Whereas Enterprise Ireland deals with the home market and the IDA deals with the external market, in the areas for which I feel responsible and the people who have sweated to achieve what they have, the companies are small. I believe in the saying that the oak grows from the acorn but we must make sure that the acorn is planted in fertile soil and given the opportunity to grow, and this foundation will help that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">I congratulate Forfás on the work it has done to get this project off the ground. Its publications are excellent, for example, this week I received an excellent research document on inflation and I congratulate the author of that document which is unbiased and prepared to the highest possible standards. It is a good base document for many issues that are now threatening the economy, and on a related issue, I hope the Minister of State will support the retention of the groceries order when we deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">Science Foundation Ireland is a direct result of the proposals put forward by Forfás in 1998 with a view to improving the opportunities that Ireland could offer on the development of ICT and the biotechnology sectors. Its work on this vital area will stand to it in the years to come. Forfás has done a fine job. I have the highest admiration for Enterprise Ireland, and the enterprise boards, which are critically important. As someone who listens attentively to employers I am worried by the high level of costs and the valueless currency in which we now deal. Unfortunately it is hard to quantify the loss of value in the transition from punt to euro, when one thinks how valueless €50 is compared to IR£20, wherever one goes.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The Forfás document raises the issue of value for money in the public service. The taxpayer must get value for money. As the Chairman of the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee, I am aware of how efficient the Accounting Officers are at their job but dedicating funds in a particular area is good business because at least that money is ring-fenced. Experts are commissioned and that is commendable because the responsibility rests entirely with the foundation to expand science and biotechnological possibilities. With that type of niche focusing on funding at least there is a sense of responsibility which the Minister of State can clearly understand, and the foundation is accountable to him. The Minister of State will find it easy to benchmark the effectiveness of this foundation.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The economic success of the 1990s was due to the vision of the previous Governments in their investment in education, and the partnership of education with the enterprise culture, coupled with the commitment of talented young people. We have moved to a different time and a global economy where the buzz word is the computer business. Any high-tech company can move its operation on a 40 ft. lorry. It is completely different to the heavy structural businesses which had huge plant. A high-tech industry can put its plant on a 40 ft. lorry and move to a cheaper destination. It is important that we have a competitive economy, with salaries that will give people a sustainable income making it possible for them to stay in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Development in education has been a great base for this and we have very good second and third-level education. I commend this Bill and congratulate everyone involved in it but we need to be careful of our competitiveness as an economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_588">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_801">The Bill before the House is designed to make further provision for the development of industry, trade and enterprise and for that purpose to establish a body to be known as Science Foundation Ireland. This body will operate under the aegis of Forfás and its objective will be to ensure that Ireland will be to the fore in the knowledge-based economy. The knowledge society which has emerged due to modern information and communications technology is bringing about a fundamental reshaping of the global economy. We are looking at a transformation of our economy and society. It is estimated that between 70% and 80% of economic growth is now said to be due to new and better knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Innovation is quickly becoming a key factor in global competitiveness, where coming up with new or different ideas about how to do things better or faster will be central to our efforts to become a world leader in the new economy. Building the Knowledge Society, a report issued by the Information Commission to Government in December 2001, states that continuous market driven innovation is the key to competitiveness and thus to economic growth. It further points out that this requires not only a strong science and technology base, but equally important are the capacities to link fundamental and applied research, to convert the results of that research to new products, services or processes, and to bring these innovations quickly to the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The establishment of Science Foundation Ireland is a mechanism to facilitate this happening. However, I have a number of serious concerns. First, our level of competitiveness has been deteriorating in recent times as confirmed in the Forfás annual competitiveness report for 2002. It points to increasing inflation, rise in wage levels and infrastructure bottlenecks as contributing to this slide in competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The issue of infrastructure bottlenecks should sound many alarm bells. The Institute of Engineers has warned that the infrastructure element of the national development plan is behind schedule. The national development plan was put in place for 2000-06 but many of the major infrastructural projects will not be completed until 2010 and perhaps some of them not until as late as 2013. This has major implications nationally but for those of us in some of the regions, particularly in the west of Ireland, this is bad news. The reason for this is that many of the major infrastructural projects were not included in the national development plan in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The N4 to Sligo and the N5 to Mayo are not part of the priority programme for the National Roads Authority whose recent annual report talks about being charged with the development of five major interurban routes, from Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and the building of the port tunnel. If we examine the Fitzpatrick report, which looked at the spend on national roads in the BMW region and in the south and east region to the end of 2002, we see that it confirmed that the road spend in the south and east was 45% ahead of target and in the BMW region 25% behind. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has admitted that the situation has worsened during 2003, with spend in the south and east on national roads being more than 50% ahead of target, whereas in the BMW region it is more than 30% behind. How can our region be competitive? How can we in the BMW region benefit from the work of Science Foundation Ireland if our infrastructural deficit is such as to diminish our competitiveness almost completely?</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The annual report published by the IDA only yesterday makes very grim reading for those of us in the regions. The chief executive, Sean Dorgan, expressed some concern that inward investors are once again focusing on city areas as their preferred locations and that that is making it difficult to pursue in full the priority of achieving the location of 50% of all green-field jobs – not including expansions – in the Objective One region. He says</p>
          <p eId="para_807">We were well on track to achieve this target up to the end of last year but the persistent issues of infrastructure and scale are making it increasingly difficult for some regions to be sufficiently competitive to achieve this when there is capacity in the major cities because of the economic slowdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Remember what I said a few moments ago about the national development plan and projects running way over their deadlines. He said:</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Achieving progress in infrastructure and services is essential over the next three years, as at the end of 2006 Ireland will have less discretion in giving regional grants under EU state aids policy and regions will then depend largely on the quality of such services locally to be attractive to investors. This means that regions that want to attract inward investment will have to do so on their own merits rather than depending on grants as the differentiator to draw in inward investment projects. That timeframe is very short, and we are not sure that regions realise the limited timeframe available to achieve necessary developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Many people in the regions recognise that limited time frame. When the national development plan was launched, many people in the west asked the Government to front-load spending in that region so that we might have some opportunity to make up for the gap that has continued to widen since the early 1990s. However, those pleadings fell on deaf ears. Mr. Dorgan has told us in the Border, midlands and west region that we have just over three years to achieve that progress in infrastructure and that otherwise we will lose our competitiveness. We also know that many of the infrastructural projects in that region were not included in the national development plan. Some of them were included, and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was in Norway last week telling the Norwegians about our progress in balanced regional development. If that includes the building of the M1 to the Border through his constituency, good for him. That is fine, but it makes very little difference when one moves west and north of County Louth. As I said, many of the projects were not in the national development plan in the first place, but even in the case of those that were, the money is now being spent elsewhere rather than in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Where does that leave us as far as our competitiveness is concerned? I am very happy to see the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland, but how will that huge investment of €634 million benefit the regions? Will the west of Ireland benefit from the employment created or get any of the jobs? Up to now, we have not been getting them. I will give an example which many people will think could not possibly be true. However, if one checks the figures, one will find that it is. Let us take my own county of Sligo. This Government has been in office since 1997. If we take the five years from 1997 to 2002 and look at net new jobs created in IDA and Enterprise Ireland backed companies, we find that in those five years from 1997 to 2002 there were 148 net extra jobs in County Sligo. Nationally, the figure was approximately 40,000. We have not been getting the jobs up to now, so what chance do we have of getting them in future?</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Those figures are a disgrace, but particularly so for a Government which has made balanced regional development one of its core objectives. If I had a euro for every time that I have heard the phrase "balanced regional development" from Ministers and Government Deputies, I could be one of the millionaires in the Dáil of whom the Taoiseach spoke this morning. However, that will not happen, for all we have had regarding balanced regional development is talk.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Is it all doom and gloom? Can the establishment of this new agency, which I welcome, contribute in any meaningful way to the development of the regions? I will once again quote from Building the Knowledge Society, which says</p>
          <p eId="para_814">It is evident that economic productivity in the 21st century will depend on enhanced application of information and knowledge to economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Now comes the most important sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Broadband is the enabling infrastructure through which information and knowledge will be accessed, used and shared. Future economic development, including our sustained attractiveness to increasingly mobile foreign direct investment, is therefore critically dependent on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">That document tells us that broadband is the enabling infrastructure. What are the chances that we in the west might get that type of infrastructure? I am not sure, but I know that in the Estimates there was a 27% cut in the roll-out of broadband to the regions. I ask the Minister to revisit and reconsider that decision. As I have pointed out, the west of Ireland has been denied what we might call the traditional infrastructure. I have spoken at length about the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The recently published strategic rail review, while not Government policy, was also extremely disappointing. Essentially, I would call it "Pale rail", with most of the money being spent either in Dublin or in areas radiating out from it. No serious consideration is given in this strategy to redressing the balance and to looking seriously at a western rail corridor. When it comes to gas we are again looking at infrastructure we do not have. I know there are issues regarding Corrib Gas which have nothing to do with the Government but I remember Deputy Kenny making the point that whether the gas comes ashore at Corrib or not, the pipelines should be laid. One way or the other the west of Ireland must get gas infrastructure. Whether it comes from Corrib or not – I hope it does – we need both infrastructure in the west and the financial commitment from the Government which will provide it.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Though we have been denied much traditional infrastructure, there is an opportunity in the roll-out of broadband to catch up in the new knowledge society. If there is a will at Government and regional levels to promote balanced regional development, then it will actively pursue the roll-out of broadband to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Forfás issued a report which reviews 2002 and provides an outlook statement for 2003. The report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The availability of broadband communications at a competitive cost is necessary for the development in Ireland of research-intensive new generation industries such as digital media and biotechnology. Key issues going forward include the timely implementation of phase 1 [referring to the roll-out of broadband to the regions] . . .  these will be essential if Ireland is to achieve the objective, as set out in the Government's broadband strategy, of being placed in the top decile among OECD countries in terms of the availability and cost of broadband communication.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The report also refers to a critically important issue for peripheral regions:</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Notwithstanding the launch of DSL by Eircom and Esat in May 2002, Ireland is still significantly behind leading countries in terms of the price competitiveness, coverage and take-up of broadband communications by business and domestic users. Given Ireland's objective of becoming a knowledge-based and innovation-driven economy, it is critical that Ireland becomes one of the leaders in this sphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">We cannot rely on the free market to provide broadband technology to the regions. The Government must take the final responsibility, whether PSOs or other methods will be needed. We have been denied traditional infrastructure but when it comes to the knowledge-based economy of the 21st century, we still have a chance to get on an equal footing with the other regions and to play our part.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">If the regions, and the west in particular, are to get any real benefit from the €634 million which will be spent by this foundation, then the necessary infrastructure, particularly broadband, must be put in place to stimulate economic development in the west.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_589">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_826">I welcome the introduction of the Bill. It is a recognition that Ireland is beginning to see that investment in scientific research is vital if we are to keep our economy competitive. Knowledge-based industries and businesses using science and technology are key components in achieving long-term success in an increasingly globalised world.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Ireland has changed and we are no longer in a position to attract the type of industry which we attracted in previous decades. The nature of such industries and our economy now make us an unsuitable location from the perspective of those industries and that is why we must ensure we can replace those industries. However, unless we dedicate ourselves to this and ensure we have the necessary skills and technology available, we will be unable to take any significant part in this emerging arena. We need to re-position ourselves to protect future growth and prosperity. To achieve this re-positioning, we must foster scientific and technological innovation. We need to expand our research and development capabilities and establish ourselves firmly as a globally-competitive, knowledge-based economy whose innovations should lead to the creation of sustainable and high-quality employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Ireland invested in people in this way in the past. The decision to give free second level education was an important first step in this area and the foundation of the regional technical colleges, now institutes of technology, was also a significant development. It opened up new avenues to pursue the teaching of and research into the sciences and technology in general. The provision of free third level education by the rainbow coalition built upon those steps and allowed greater opportunities to pursue further higher level studies. We must ensure we protect this equality of opportunity in our education system but we must also ensure that people of all backgrounds can avail of those opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The main function of the foundation is to promote and develop world class research capability in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concern economic and social benefit and long-term competitiveness, which is a laudable aim. It is also intended that the foundation will attract research teams and individual researchers of a world class standard to carry out research in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">To achieve its first aim, however, we must ensure that we put in the foundations at the most basic levels in our education system. The Task Force on Science reported the year before last and made 39 recommendations. Progress in relation to implementation has been painfully slow; 35 of these recommendations relate to the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science, so perhaps it is a relief to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is present, that he is not responsible. Partial progress has been made on 19 of these recommendations according to a reply I received to a parliamentary question, though I am not sure what is meant by partial progress. Work has been initiated on a further six and nothing has been done on the remaining ten recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Regarding the progress actually made, in a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister for Education and Science stated that new syllabi have been implemented at leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry, which is true. However, this ignores the fact that there are still secondary schools which cannot offer those three core science subjects to leaving certificate students. We cannot progress and set up the foundation when there are schoolchildren who cannot take those three science subjects to leaving certificate level. That must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Minister also said that the revised junior certificate science syllabus is beginning in schools in 2003-04. While that is technically correct, the reality is far different. I welcome the new syllabus; it is more innovative, more practical and hopefully more stimulating than the previous syllabus. However, it is wrong to have a syllabus available in some schools and not in others. If the Government believed in equality of opportunity it would ensure that each junior certificate student in 2006 will sit the same examination having been taught in the same way in all schools. That will not be the case, however, as the syllabus starts in some schools this September and not in others. The Minister's offer of a special grant for schools implementing the syllabus ignores the fact that some schools just do not have the resources and equipment to do it. The new course has 30 mandatory experiments, which must be written up by students. If they do not have the means of performing the experiments they cannot report on how they conducted them, nor can they be examined on the experiments fairly. The implementation of a new science programme and the proper development of science as a subject in schools cannot happen unless the resources and equipment are provided. Science cannot be taught and certainly cannot be brought to life by textbooks alone. Unless it is brought to life we will not halt the decline in science as a subject choice among our students.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The Minister's reply went on to deal with other recommendations which relate to the science area. When mentioning the ICT grants for primary schools he failed to mention the massive cuts in these grants despite the departmental circular to schools clearly leading them to believe that grants of a similar level would issue in 2003. Schools all over the country borrowed on the expectation that these grants would still be available at the same level and they are now trying desperately to repay these loans as the Minister has reneged on the commitment of his predecessor. Schools have got to have the wherewithal to develop IT if we are to have any hope of developing this type of knowledge-based economy. The Minister claims that the ratio of pupils to computers in primary schools is 11:1 and 9:1 in post primary, which is a welcome achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">However, the reality in some schools is quite different.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Allied to the lack of IT facilities in some of these schools, many schools are unable to make proper use of IT facilities. I visited a school last week where the computers are still in boxes due to overcrowding in the school. There is no space in which to set up the computers. If a school gets a grant and does not spend it, the grant must be returned or it will not get it next year. The school is forced to buy the equipment so it will have it, but it does not have the space in which to operate it. Children will learn little from a computer which never comes out of the box.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">If we are to develop in this area and if Science Foundation Ireland is to meet its aim, we must develop at a more basic level and that will take much more than lip-service and repetition of the amounts of funding spent in the past. We must ensure money is spent properly and that we are getting value for money. No school principal would ever turn down a grant because he or she could not afford to do so. I certainly would not ask a school principal to do so, but the grant system must be tidied up so that principals know what they are getting, what it is for and when they will get it and if it is promised for next year, it should be paid next year. The Minister, in turn, must ensure that the payment of the grant achieves the objectives for which the grant is being provided. A census was recently conducted in schools and I hope the results of it will allow the Minister to once and for all carry out proper strategic planning to ensure the proper funding and development of IT and ICT in schools. The importance of this cannot be underestimated. These subjects must not only be brought to life but they must be made a way of life if the aims of Science Foundation Ireland are to be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I welcome the Forfás initiative, which has been running for two years, of the primary science clubs working between schools and institutes of technology on a pilot basis. I hope this initiative will spread to all primary schools. It is vital that children are introduced to the idea of going to college at a young age and it is equally vital that at that age they are introduced to science as an option at college level. Children are shown through these science clubs that science can be fun but also how it impacts on their daily lives. It is important these initiatives are used as much as possible. Science Foundation Ireland must begin to take responsibility for ensuring the accessibility of our universities and institutes of technology to children at primary and secondary levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">While I welcome this Bill, I would be less than genuine if I did not point out my concerns about the commitment of the Government in this area. If it truly believed in the importance of research and the development of a research and knowledge based economy, it would match its actions to its words. In 1999, a dedicated research funding programme, the programme for research in third level institutions, was established by the then Minister for Education and Science. Funding for that programme in 2002 was €43.2 million, yet funding in 2003 was reduced without any prior warning. The capital funding in 2002 was just under €23 million, yet this year it was €7.5 million. Current funding was down approximately €4 million. This has meant that research in third level institutions is being conducted on what can only be described as a stop-go basis, and there is much more stopping than going at present. This reduction has had the effect that little or no calls for proposals in basic research grants were forthcoming for 2003. This runs contrary to the Government's expressed desire to move our economy to a knowledge-based one from a manufacturing based economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The importance of basic research projects cannot be under estimated. They focus on high quality novel exploratory research which is not necessarily always linked to a final product or process. The dividends of this research are potentially greater than the direct funding of product and process development. To provide knowledge workers – workers with skills and capabilities – we need to invest in training and this is done by exposing them to the best possible teachers available. The best possible teachers available at third level are those conducting research because they are at the cutting edge of their fields of expertise in science and technology. If we do not treat them properly and provide the proper funding in this area, we will achieve nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Section 7 mentions specifically information and communications technologies and bio-technology as two of the main areas on which Science Foundation Ireland intends to focus. I question that and I ask that Science Foundation Ireland does not in any way limit itself to these two areas specifically. Everything moves along, including science and technology, and we should not limit ourselves. We limited ourselves to the manufacturing industry for a long time but it has moved on. We must be prepared for changes in the economy and in the environment. Limiting ourselves to these two areas would be a backward step.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">When the secretary general of the European Science Foundation, Professor Banda, visited Ireland in 1999 he stated: "The basic research has to be there. The only problem politically in defending basic research is the long-term aspects". The Skillbeck report on the Irish university sector stated that there was a need to "balance current nationally competitive research concentration in the sciences, notably biotechnology and information technology, with support and encouragement for the advancement of knowledge and scholarship on a broad front and in all parts of the institutions". What was said by Professor Banda and in the Skillbeck report highlights the importance of not concentrating on one area.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The development of basic research on a broad basis leads to new discoveries which lead to new products, innovations and it fuels entrepreneurship and economic activity. Our leaving certificate cycle is currently being reviewed in order to look at entrepreneurship and at trying to develop it. I would not call entrepreneurship a skill in that it is, to some extent, ingrained in some people while it must be developed in others. If we are to look at it at leaving certificate level, we must ensure those skills, if developed at that stage, are not hampered when students reach a higher level.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The previous Government recognised that an increased level of investment in basic research is a necessity to move Ireland to a more knowledge based value added economy. We need to generate new knowledge in Ireland to complement our strong manufacturing base. The national development plan identifies the development of world class research environments in higher education and State research institutions as a key objective of investment in RTDI, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The cuts which took place last year will not be reversed but I am concerned about comments made by the Minister for Education and Science on future cuts in the third level building programme. Dr. Mary Meaney, who chairs the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology, has said it will have a knock-on effect on the economy. I accept value for money is vital and that any investment made in third level institutions must provide a genuine and proper return and that the money must be spent properly but I question the aims of the Minister in this regard. Is this a revenue raising or a money saving exercise as distinct from a genuine value for money approach? Sometimes people argue that cutting capital funding is not as bad as cutting capital spending. Last year's cuts meant that colleges and third level institutions which had entered into contracts with people to carry out projects and research under their current spending discovered that they did not have the physical equipment to give to these people or the space for them because of cuts in capital funding. One cut has a serious knock-on effect on another area.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Science Foundation Ireland should have been placed on a statutory footing earlier, especially given the amount of money already committed to the foundation. The delay in placing it on a statutory footing impedes the implementation of value for money as a concept.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Section 7 deals with the objectives of Science Foundation Ireland. It places emphasis on the promotion and development of a world class research capability in strategic areas relating to economic and social benefits and long-term competitiveness. While these are worthy values to espouse, there are other values such as those to which science can make human advancement. They are not always purely economic and that should be noted as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The issue of value for money, which I mentioned, is also tied into the issue of accountability of the science foundation to the Dáil. Section 7 allows for the granting of extra functions to the science foundation beyond those envisaged in the legislation. The granting of these extra areas of responsibility should not be the sole responsibility of the Minister. The legislation needs to be amended to allow this House to have a greater say in any future direction which the science foundation may wish to take. Section 23 obliges the science foundation to prepare an annual work programme to be presented to the House and to prepare a strategy statement every five years. It is essential Members of the House are informed of the direction the Minister is giving the foundation in relation to its proposed five year strategy. Perhaps Members will also be given the ability to analyse and comment on the viability of the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Section 14(2) specifically states that in the performance of his or her duties under the section, the director general shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister or on the merits of the objectives of any such policy. I find this highly objectionable. We are asking people to work in a body and to promote, research and develop a knowledge-based economy but not to tell us if Government policy contradicts the aim of the foundation. That is an enormous contradiction and the foundation should be allowed express its opinions on Government policy if there is to be any real development in this area. Section 14(2) will not allow for this and it needs to be amended. It would make no sense if the foundation, to which we have given so much money and which is trying to develop world-class research capability, was not allowed to comment of Government policy if its policy conflicted with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I am also concerned about the lack of competitiveness in the economy. The legislation is a first step in trying to address this but the funding of research and development will be futile if Ireland is not seen by international investors as an attractive investment location. Our efforts to attract international investors through the certification of our research and development capabilities cannot succeed if Ireland is seen to be a place where high costs, poor infrastructure and public services are not addressed. A recent survey by the Swiss group IMD has shown that Ireland slipped from sixth to 11th position in 2000 in terms of the competitiveness of small countries. The Government has consistently made commitments to tackle our falling level of competitiveness but nothing has been achieved and we are falling further behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The deterioration in our competitiveness is worrying but it is exacerbated by the backwardness of our IT infrastructure. This is a direct result of the failure of the previous Government to invest in this area when money was definitely available to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Our research and development facilities, broadband capacity and infrastructure in general, specifically in the area of transport, are well below the standards evident in other European countries. The Minister must act to accelerate the roll-out of broadband technology, as Deputy Harkin stated previously. There is a grave danger that broadband will be rolled out everywhere just as another technology is invented to replace it. That is the pace at which we are progressing and I am very concerned about it. It is undermining our competitiveness to the detriment of job creation and the advancement of research and development centres of excellence. I assume the foundation and the Members want to achieve excellence in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">While the funding of the foundation is a positive development, there should be a long-term commitment to funding. The Government's investment in research and development cannot be on a stop-go basis. It must establish a long-term strategy of funding if the foundation is to develop fully its research projects and if those projects are to bear fruit in terms of job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">The creation of a world-renowned, knowledge-based economy is totally dependent on attracting top-class scientists who will commit to long-term projects. They will come to Ireland only if they are guaranteed secure funding. If not, they will go elsewhere. We will have to do a great deal more to encourage our third level students to stay here and progress to post-graduate level. Insufficient numbers of them are doing so. I am all for our students going to universities in other countries as well because they have to pick up expertise in other areas. I hope those who want to stay here will be given every opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I welcome the Bill in general.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_590">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_855">I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated at the opening of this debate that the new Science Foundation Ireland is central to the overall strategy to establish Ireland as a leader in the global knowledge based economy. I agree with her. There is consensus at all levels of society that we should create a knowledge driven economy and that we need excellence in basic research. We also need to make sure the benefits of this research are passed on to all the people and not just the major centres on the east coast. The Border region, especially, suffered much over the past 30 years because of the troubles in Northern Ireland. It has not seen much job creation in recent years. About 750,000 more people are working now than were working ten years ago. However, this will not continue to be the case unless we use research to provide new products and more competitive ways of producing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">It is disappointing that science is not one of the more popular subjects in secondary schools. The recent figures are extremely worrying in this regard. Some schools do not even have proper classroom facilities, such as the Collegiate School in Monaghan. This school was promised that it would get proper classroom facilities and equipment so it could teach science and IT in a similar way to its counterparts in the town and especially those north of the Border. Science must also be encouraged at primary school level because if we do not encourage interest we will not have the desired results at secondary and third levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">As the Minister stated, science, technology, research and innovation are the key words of the future. We must ensure that research capability in our universities and institutes is linked to a central body. The universities and institutes have a world of information and commitment which can move industry forward. It is clear that jobs are often based near institutes of learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I worry that we do not have any major centre of learning in County Monaghan although it is the centre of the furniture and food industries. Proper training in those sectors is available only outside the county. In the case of furniture, one has to go to the far west and the deep south. Opportunities for an appropriate institute were lost when St. Patrick's Agricultural College was closed and sold for £750,000. Its accommodation could have serviced the furniture, engineering and food industries. If these industries are not afforded the benefits of research and innovation, together with proper training, they will not survive when competing with low-cost production. The furniture industry in Monaghan is trying to compete with industries exporting furniture products into the country from western Europe. These products are being distributed by some of our industries, which are putting their workers on a two and three day week. If we do not improve the quality of our product and stop competing against the companies creating lower-cost products, the industry will have serious problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The Government's failure to control inflation in recent years is even more serious for the home based industries which have to compete on price. It is interesting that the Government organisation Forfás warned about this in a recent report and made it clear that we are in danger of losing jobs if the problem is not treated seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Insurance costs have spiralled out of control. Recently, a long established, community owned furniture industry in County Meath stated clearly that its insurance cost was a major reason for its closure.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Research and innovation must be encouraged alongside infrastructural development, such as roads and broadband. Our quality food industry, now under serious pressure from questionable foreign imports, will have to move forward towards consumer ready products. I and some of my colleagues are sometimes blamed for the closure of Monaghan Poultry Products, where more than 300 people were employed. It lost out because it did not move forward, innovate and create new products. In 1996, with the support of Forbairt, I secured for it a grant of £1.25 million to start a modernisation programme. Unfortunately, they fell behind and did not utilise it and as a result were forced out of business. I give this example not just to justify my own situation but to warn other industries that they cannot stand still. They either move forward or go out of business. They must use the technology available which may mean the loss of jobs in one sector of a business. However, those who do not move forward or use the information available lose out.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The Government must tackle our deteriorating level of competitiveness. It is worrying that it has failed to do so in many areas. The imposition of massive indirect taxes since the general election and the failure to plan ahead during sound economic and financial times and make the decisions which would encourage investment, particularly in infrastructure projects, are part of the problem. We must look at this situation seriously and put the blame where it lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">We all welcomed the commitments in the national development plan to infrastructure. Only the other day I travelled to Dublin via the new bridge at Drogheda, which shows what is possible. I got to Dublin in one and three quarter hours instead of the two and a half or three hours it normally takes. Infrastructure can be of major benefit in regard to time, and time means money.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The worrying thing in regard to the BMW region is that the money available is being utilised on the east coast. Innovation is important but infrastructure is equally so. We need to move industry into the regions if everybody is to be treated equally. In the last week I put a question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, perhaps I did not make it detailed enough, to do with the number of jobs created by the IDA, etc., in the Border region. My question concerned the country in general and my own counties of Cavan and Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The reply indicated that the number of people employed in IDA-based factories in the year 2000 was 140,000. The highest number we have achieved in Monaghan is 469 and that number is only as a result of a new factory opened last year. When the Minister looks at those figures he must ask if the benefits of the now dead Celtic tiger were spread equally around the country. I ask that this new body, which has been in place for some time, be given the teeth and encouragement to ensure that more isolated areas which have suffered, as we in the Border region have suffered as a result of the Troubles over the last 30 years, get a fair share.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">My colleague from Sligo mentioned the broadband issue and delays and cutbacks in funding for it. We must look at innovative ways of making broadband available to smaller, more isolated communities. The way technology is moving, if we wait for broadband to be rolled out we will not get it until it is too late. We have an application in for wireless technology in the Border region between Armagh and Monaghan. It is vital that this technology be grant aided and supported in such areas. They may not have a proper road infrastructure but they should at least be given the structures to make progress possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I said earlier that we do not have proper college structures in Monaghan. It is possibly our own fault for allowing others to get away with the places. The college for further studies in Cavan has 750 students whereas Monaghan has only 130 or so. I tried to get Queen's University and others involved in Monaghan some years ago but there was reaction against my proposal and it did not work out. The lack of jobs in high-tech industry is a problem for us. Our young people who get a good college education do not have the opportunity to return to their home area to work. That is disappointing for them but it is more serious for long-term infrastructure in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I know a young man who has his own industry outside Carrickmacross. I visited him when he was setting up in business in the old cow byre of his home. He has moved forward from that to an advance factory in Carrickmacross and since then to his own factory. We do not give that sort of person the level of support we should. If a foreign industry moves into the country it gets the red carpet treatment. At least I thought it did until I looked for the figures for those visiting the northern region. Unfortunately the Minister was not able to tell me how many came to Monaghan but out of 147 site visits by industry this year, only 17 came to the north-east region. That region includes the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern's, constituency of Louth. No doubt of the 17 site visits to the region, very few were to Monaghan. We need this issue sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I have some worries about the Bill. The National Roads Authority is an independent body and if I want to find out what is happening in regard to bypasses in Castleblayney, Monaghan or elsewhere it is difficult to get answers because it is not answerable to this House. Is the Minister satisfied that this new body will be answerable to the House? Due to the fact that the Government is committing a sizeable amount of money to the body, it is vital that it is answerable to the House, or one of the committees of the House, on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">A body I was involved with, the CBF – now An Bord Bia – is independent but depends on finance from the State. In spite of the difficulties in the agricultural sector this year its money was cut at budget time. In her Second Stage speech the Minister, whom I have no reason to disbelieve, said that this new body is one of the most important bodies we have had and that it will bring innovation and research which will move the country into a new era of competitiveness as a result of being able to produce goods which others cannot. It can only do that if it is answerable to this House and if the House provides the finance it needs, not just on a once-off basis but on a guaranteed long-term basis. There is nothing as demeaning for senior staff who commit themselves to an organisation than to find themselves having to cut back in the middle of a programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">That has been seen recently in regard to partnership programmes at county and national level. Different areas were fairly sure when they began the programmes last January that they would have the funds to carry them through but they do not have them.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">It is vital that the new organisation, which all Members generally support, gets the necessary commitment from Government. We must be sure, when the body puts forward programmes and takes on the high-quality staff needed to make this work, that it does work. In turn, the body must make sure it co-operates with the universities and colleges of technology. In my experience, particularly in regard to Dundalk IT, they have given tremendous impetus to the provision of information and training of personnel in the workforce, relevant to jobs in that area. That type of contact is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I wish to deal with a short but important story. In 1996, I learned that a company in Carrickmacross dealing in plastic was to be provided by Forfás with a plant in County Leitrim. Eventually, the company was persuaded to move to Castleblaney instead of County Leitrim. However, I am concerned by this example of a national body not listening to anybody. If it had not been for the then Cavan county manager, Mr. Joe Gavin, advising me on what was happening, I would not have known about it until it was too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">This matter raises questions about the commitment of a national body to the regions. Counties Cavan and Monaghan are in the BMW region and the people of that area hear regularly about commitments, including that a large percentage of the jobs coming to this country in the near future will be committed to that region. We have seen a Government which had an opportunity to locate a cross-Border body in the region moving it instead to County Cork. If this Government has any realistic support for the Good Friday Agreement, Science Foundation Ireland must work with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, and the people of the Border region, to ensure that the promises of that Agreement mean something to those who have suffered most over the 30 years of the Troubles.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The people of that area did not have the opportunities which others had. While travelling in Canada in recent weeks, I was told by many people that when they visit Ireland, they arrive in Dublin or Shannon and are then directed to Galway or further south. However, they are certainly not directed to visit the Border region.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">One of the research programmes which this structurally-based body could carry out would be to consider the situation regarding the development of tourism. There should be a willingness to re direct tourists to all parts of the island, not just the handy areas of County Kerry, the west and the sunny south-east. The Border region has possibilities in the beauty of the rolling hills of County Monaghan, the lakes of County Cavan and otherwise. We have reason to work with our counterparts in Northern Ireland in that regard. While the overall body has been established, it does not seem to be delivering at present. We need to research this area to find how we can benefit from and utilise the basic infrastructure which is in place. I wish the Bill well. It has my support and that of my party.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_591">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_877">I was not aware I was to speak in the House until 20 minutes ago which, depending on how one looks at it, is either a boon or curse for Government members. I am the education and science spokesperson for the Green Party and have a particular interest in this Bill. I have been involved as a member of the Friends of Science since it was established and have learned much in the interim about science and how it operates, and about the benefits of having a body such as Science Foundation Ireland. While I will address some of the merits of the Bill, I will also speak in a wider context to say that while Science Foundation Ireland as an entity is welcome, we will be on a hiding to nothing unless the other coins in the slot fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I want to deal with a number of angles regarding this subject. In doing so, I wish to highlight some of the contributions which Government spokespersons or backbenchers have made to the debate. One of the first I noticed was that of Deputy Eoin Ryan who said that the Bill signals a fundamental change in our appreciation of the importance of research and development as an element of national infrastructure and that, in concert with other initiatives by the HEA, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, it aims to put us firmly on the map as a research performer. If it does signal such a change, it has been a long time coming. We have a lot of catching up to do in that context and it is not good enough to simply set up a body which is, at present, operating on an interim basis as a sub-board of Forfás and will, through the Bill, be established as a separate legal entity. It is not enough to establish Science Foundation Ireland unless some of the other parts of the equation are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The stated aim of section 7(1) of the Bill is to create a standard of excellence in oriented basic research, to significantly develop our capability to conduct research by attracting world-class researchers to Ireland, and to have these scientists conduct the basic research on which future technologies will be built. There is a major flaw in that aim. Ireland has among the lowest level of indigenous research and development investment throughout the EU whereas Finland has the highest. It is no surprise, therefore, that Finland has a much more successful indigenous enterprise level. Nokia, a home-grown Finnish company, is a world-class brand which has taken over the mobile phone market and other aspects of telephony. Ireland does not have many home-grown heroes and where we do, they seem to be hubs of US multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I have a lot of respect for US multinationals. In a previous incarnation, I worked as a business journalist for manufacturing, research and development and IT magazines. I had the opportunity to visit many multinational companies, some US owned, some European owned and a few which were Irish owned. The Irish companies were generally smaller IT companies trying to blaze a trail in the software area, and some where quite successful in that. I no longer work as a journalist and am trying to be a Deputy. However, I worked full time in the field of journalism from 1992 until I became a councillor in 1999, and only gave up journalism completely in 2001 in the run-up to the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Over the period of my work in journalism, I noticed a sea change in the economy and the boom which was created. During the debate on this Bill, there was banter from Deputies on both sides of the House regarding who was responsible for the boom. Every party that has been in Government can take some responsibility for the boom as much as the <i>laissez-faire</i> principles of the most recent Governments. In many ways, it was the IDA, learning the lessons of the past in trying to attract research and development and overseas industry to Ireland, that created the boom and the skilled workforce enabled us to meet the economic conditions those companies required. However, we have now moved on and may not have a similar boom for 50 years. Deputy Harney constantly tells us that we must move forward, add value and become more innovative in our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill is welcome in many ways. However, it has a narrow focus on IT and biotechnology, whereas it could reach out further and create the kinds of conditions that would enable indigenous research and development to thrive. There are many entrepreneurs in Ireland who, if given the opportunity, would be able to make a significant economic contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">I am from the 1980s generation, which used to dance to the Human League, Culture Club, Wham and other bands that people laugh at now, and what I remember from that decade is high unemployment. Many people in my peer group – friends, relatives and friends of friends – studied some form of science-based subject, but were forced to emigrate because there were not enough jobs. Even when the jobs became available, to these people's shock and horror many of them found that, despite their qualifications, they were doing bit jobs. They were fitting into a slot for a multinational company which wanted to take a modular approach to industry and research and development. These people were usually over-skilled for the jobs they were doing and, while they welcomed being able to work, earn money and invest at home, it drove others away because they were not able to get the right job in order to set up a home base and earn what they felt was their worth.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The next generation has now come on and, up to recently, people have expected to earn huge sums in software development, for example. They can click their fingers and name their salary, perhaps saying they have received a better offer from a Canadian company, and such salaries rose rapidly. Now that the economy is a bit more tetchy, people can no longer command these salaries. It is a welcome lesson that such people cannot get what they want, because a certain generation grew up thinking this is how it is, whereas some of us have had to go through life the hard way. A little hardship is good for everyone, but we do not want to see this well-educated generation leaving the country and staying away. We do not want Deputy Brian Lenihan following in his late father's footsteps by saying that this island is too small for all of us. Nonetheless, it will go that way unless we are able to offer a true scientific community.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">I recently joined Science Foundation Ireland's friends of science group and I have one of its glossy brochures with me. I have met Mr. Harris, who is doing a good job. I do not want to denigrate any of the individuals involved in Science Foundation Ireland. They are doing a good job, even though the foundation has not yet been established on a statutory basis. Clearly, more needs to be done outside the scope of this Bill for it to work and the Green Party cannot have confidence in the Bill in the absence of those other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">An interesting magazine cutting was included with Science Foundation Ireland's brochure, the headline of which reads: "Ireland's new NSF-inspired funding agency has more money than scientists had dared hope for."  In one sense that is welcome, because science has not received money in the past. However, while some of the new measures are welcome, unless we encourage people to study science subjects at secondary and third level and remain in the country, we will have a problem. This goes back to what the Minister said about Ireland being a value-added economy. If one wants to add value, there is no point in totally kowtowing to the multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">We may be engaged in setting up successful research departments in many of the colleges and integrating them with such companies but, in many cases, it suits the companies' own ends because they operate on a modular basis in that they want particular sections of projects to be executed in Ireland, in consultation – via modern telecommunications – with people based in Canada, the US and the Far East. In these cases, everyone is part of the team and the Irish contribution is essential. This keeps people in the country and contributes to our scientific community. However, in the long-term, we must facilitate indigenous research and development to a far greater extent for any decline in the economy. There is talk of a recovery and I heard a journalist talk about a recovery in 2008 because of the Olympic Games, which goes to prove that economics is a social science, based on social interaction. Therefore, there is no way of knowing what way the economy will go. If the Government said tomorrow that house prices were going to crash, and enough people believed it, house prices would crash. The trouble with economics is that it is not predictable. However, people's response to the economic cycle is predictable. If one is able to respond positively to a cycle when times are bad, the impact will be minimised and, when things are good, one will reap the rewards.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, whose brief covers this Bill, and I are not confident enough is being done to invest in science in order to ensure we reap the rewards. As I said earlier, the Bill has a narrow focus of ICT and biotechnology. Comments are frequently made about Green Party members being Luddites and that we wish to return to the year dot and start from scratch. It is interesting, therefore, that Green parties throughout the world, including ourselves, are to the fore in promoting scientific research. We are trying to make it ethical and environmentally sound and we have certain concerns in relation to biotechnology and genetic engineering but, on the whole, being environmentally-conscious and a friend of science goes hand in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">There are many things which science can offer which can also help society. I do not want to refer to too many clichés, but one must examine the potential of wave and wind power off our coast. Studies have already been carried out off the coast of Scotland which indicate that four times as much energy as is required by the UK can be produced purely through wave power. I have no doubt that the same is true of the west coast of Ireland and I do not see why the Government does not increase its investment ten-fold in this area. As we have seen before with oil exploration, the Government has a carrot and stick approach to these companies. They will not drill if the penalties are too great and the Exchequer will not earn much if they strike black gold. The same applies to gas, although to a lesser extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">If we invest in research and development, we have the potential to play a leading role in terms of the development of wave technology. We could be an energy exporter in that field. However, the question is whether or not the Government will invest significant funding in that area. I think not. I do not think the commitment is there, because that would be too visionary. So far, the policy seems to have been to get jobs from the multinationals, but create the Irish jobs through sub-contractors – let the suppliers to the multinationals be the indigenous job creators rather than the Irish innovators.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Perhaps it is a social issue, maybe we still have an inferiority complex. When Bob Geldof was trying to set up his own business in the 1970s, he was asked by Conor Cruise O'Brien, "Is that it?", and told he had not a chance in hell because it would take too long. Bob Geldof went off to Canada, did some work and then came back and tried a totally different tack. We know he made it and we recognise the contribution he has made.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Following recent economic success, we should have the confidence to go past that and take risks. The Government should invest in risk because it is the basis of entrepreneurial activity, the safe option will get us nowhere. By investing in wave technology or rape seed oil, we could be self sufficient in our energy requirements – such scientific research is desperately needed. We could become a leading player in technology that would be home-grown in conjunction with the universities and those who are willing to establish colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I know of one person who wants to set up an IT college in west Clare. Such people are looking for funding but do not always get it. We have, however, the likes of Media Lab, which is attracting a lot of foreign scientific knowledge but is not necessarily investing in our best and brightest. When Deputy Gormley was Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1994, instead of using the normal Volvo, he used a Volkswagen Golf that ran on home-grown material. If enough money was put into research in that area, it could be an economically viable material.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">As Green Party education spokesperson, I am concerned about science in schools. People from the STEPS programme that attempts to involved people in engineering have made representations to the Joint Committee on Education and Science. They are doing a good job but unless there is investment to ensure every primary and secondary school has sufficient IT equipment and that every second level school has proper science laboratories, engineering will not come to the fore. People will not study science if it is seen as a difficult subject or if they cannot do it properly. That is part of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">The investment needed to make Science Foundation Ireland a legal entity should be matched by proper investment in science in education because, as I said to the Minister for Education and Science, in relation to science, it is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">A number of IT pilot projects were set up at primary level, including Wired for Learning, which involved piggy-backing on the IT expertise of American companies and putting something totally unsuitable to Irish culture into schools. In feedback, the schools said they were happy to get the computer equipment and adapted it to their needs because there was a shortage of equipment but that did not mean that Wired for Learning worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">We should take the long-term approach when it comes to the development of science and invest at the front end of the cycle, even if money has to be removed from the special savings investment accounts, borrowed or, having chloroformed the Minister for Finance until after the budget, raised through increased taxation for higher earners. The money must be provided and spent now so the rewards can be reaped.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">In the next economic cycle we will need a knowledge-based economy but it is not good enough to have a knowledge base that feeds into a module of a foreign company because eventually that knowledge base will exist in eastern Europe and Asia and the same thing that happened to our manufacturing will happen again. The only way to do this is for us to take control of our own destiny and invest in our own knowledge base alongside the excellent work being done with multinational companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">While welcoming many aspects of Science Foundation Ireland, it is not enough. More needs to be done in indigenous research and development in forms of technology other than ICT and biotechnology and investment must be made at the primary and secondary levels.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_592">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_900">Due to the structure of Dáil debates there is significant repetition this afternoon and, unfortunately, I will not be any different so I apologise to the Department and Oireachtas officials who have to sit through their version of groundhog day while they are here.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The role of Science Foundation Ireland is to focus on fields that underpin the biotechnology and information and communication technology in this State. When I was reading reports on the issue, words like "excellence in science", "technology innovation" and "first class research" fall off the pages. The reports can only offer a synopsis of all the work that has been done by the Minister, officials and all of those people who have been involved in ensuring Science Foundation Ireland will be a success in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">In a previous debate on this Bill, some Members questioned why it was not discussed at length before Science Foundation Ireland was established. There have been complaints about the fact that everyone else had their say before Members of this House. Science Foundation Ireland will be fundamental to the future development of Irish industry and, whatever about the past, we will have ample opportunity to discuss the development of this organisation into the future. This will be an important role for the Dáil in years to come but Deputies on both sides of the House must grasp the ethos needed to make the foundation a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">We must encourage and develop an environment that will sustain the successful implementation of this project and it must extend far beyond what we can discuss today. Science Foundation Ireland is spearheading the arrival of a new sector in our industrial base, one based on research and development, that many of us know very little about. There are a number of variables, such as the economic and financial implications to the State, the role of the education system and the practical issues of research as well as the ethical issues surrounding it. All these mean that the future development of Science Foundation Ireland will be very difficult to lay out before the Dáil in the course of one debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">In highly developed technological economies like the United States, this industrial base has been developed over decades and we are in our infancy in comparison. We are attempting to buy ourselves into this industry and have a serious game of catch-up to play. If all objectives of Science Foundation Ireland are properly funded, however, and if it receives the political commitment it needs to succeed, we will see a change in Ireland's industrial development that will surpass any of the economic changes that Seán Lemass dreamt about when he promoted a new approach to industrial policy in the 1960s.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">In the same way that changes made in education by people like Donogh O'Malley primed Irish society for the industrial development of the 1960s, we now have the educational ethos to make the ideals of Science Foundation Ireland work. We need single-minded political will and a far-sighted view from all political opinion in this House over the coming years to succeed. There are many black holes that could quickly destroy this project. There is political ignorance, because many people do not understand science, political fear because we do not want to support something that may rebound on us, a lack of political commitment because we do not see progress fast enough and there may be a lack of willingness to finance a project where we might not see the returns of for another five years, even until after the next election.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The political picture, however, will be set by how we react to the basic outcomes of any research-based industry. This must be put across by the Government of the day because only a small proportion of the numerous research and development projects that will be funded will ever provide suitable results that will move many of these projects on to the next stage. Even fewer will result in significant commercial projects that we can implement in a wider industrial society.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">Therefore, for many who are disinterested or who are not prepared to fully embed themselves in this significant new development, reading the annual reports from Science Foundation Ireland will not make a pretty picture. This will be the important role of the Dáil in the future. The annual reports must be laid before the Dáil so that Members who have a genuine interest in the future of biotechnology and who see the IT sector as a way forward for Irish industry will be able to read these in an open and transparent way. This will enable us to see how this strategy is working for Ireland. I presume the five-year strategy will remain under the scrutiny of a relevant Oireachtas committee. This may need to be changed in the future and it is important that Members have a say in how this will proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">In many respects, the future of Science Foundation Ireland is beyond our control because we do not know how the economy or research will develop or the result of the many projects we will implement, all of which will cost millions of euro to the taxpayer. There is a gamble involved and we must look at in that light. We are trying to do something that is new, innovative and has not been tried here for at least 40 years. However, we can influence how the building blocks of this new technology are built on. Some of these issues have been raised by other Members during the course of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The educational system must get the resources needed to promote a science-based culture to reach its full potential. Many of us have successfully completed science-based degrees even though we attended secondary schools with Victorian type school laboratories. Significant progress has been made in the quality of the laboratories in most of our third level institutions. Many of our secondary schools are still nothing more than a couple of sinks and a few test tubes away from what is called a laboratory. All schools are affected. Numerous questions are put to the Minister for Education and Science on a daily basis about the lack of funding to secondary schools and especially to the sciences and laboratory services. Often there is a bias against girls' schools. This needs to be corrected quickly if we are to develop the ethos of Science Foundation Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Many of the physical resources are in place in third level institutions irrespective of what many say. The level of research in these institutions is also of a high academic standard. If there is a weakness in our third level institutions, it is in moving this high calibre research from the campus to the workplace. We are well respected in many areas. A relation of mine who works as a lecturer in mathematics in the University of San Diego was impressed by the way we can have a mixture of academia and business in our universities. He spent a year in the faculty of mathematics in UCC and was impressed by the way we can mix the pure application of theory into the business side of mathematics and engineering.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">A brief discussion with him about the mixture of university research with business input and the Government support that is needed to get this idea off the ground means there is a daunting task ahead, not only for the Government but for all who genuinely believe this is the way forward. A small number of Irish companies continue to extend the bridge between the university and the business world. We can learn from these people, many of whom would be well known to those involved in Science Foundation Ireland. Many professors and lecturers, either still working in universities or who may have left recently, have set up companies that have put the practical application of university research back into the business world. Science Foundation Ireland seeks to make this common practice and a new entity for Irish industry. That is something I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The Government has the important role of promoting the commercialisation of Irish research which is supported by taxpayers' money. There will be a need to tighten the ownership of this research but, more important, we should be careful that we do not exert too much control because tightening the band too much can often be counterproductive in the long-term and can kill the research we are trying to promote.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">If Ireland succeeds in developing the ideals behind Science Foundation Ireland we will also see changes in society and will need to be more proactive in seeing these changes through. This will not happen on its own. While Science Foundation Ireland may change industry, our society will change quickly with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Information technology has become an integral part of Irish business. There is also good penetration in the public sector where the transfer of information is vital. We are still lagging behind even in areas where we have information technology protocols. Their implementation has been erratic and piecemeal. I have seen this in the health services where there are no real software packages that would allow heart service providers worldwide to speak to each other via the Internet. The health boards, hospitals and the Department of Health and Children all have different systems. I am aware the GMS has set up its own information unit to try to get this working in a more logical way. This idea should be extended to all Government services and all of us must become more IT-aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">It is time the Government looked at the broad picture and stopped paying lip-service to issues such as broadband. We need to get broadband rolled out quickly, otherwise all of this will falter. It will operate around a couple of major urban areas to no great extent and it certainly will not be the great dream and idealist view we have of Science Foundation Ireland at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">IT in our schools is extremely important and it is time to get real on that as well. As politicians, we must embrace these new developments. We may well look back at this day and see that what we are doing here today is the same as what happened when Seán Lemass started on the road to industrialising Ireland 40 years ago. I hope that is the ethos coming from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to Science Foundation Ireland. If so, I would certainly be supportive of everything that is done and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_593">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_917">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I welcome the Bill. I note that €120 million has been allocated to the foundation and this is now being put on a statutory basis. It is time this was done. It is important that the funding is put in place in regard to our educational system. I commend the education system in Ireland. There is no doubt we have the finest third level students. We never had better educated people and we need to keep ahead of the posse. Ireland kept its education system ahead of many other countries in the past. I compliment those who have been involved in it, those who built it up and those who fought for funding from the State. The recent attempt by the Government and the Minister to impose third level fees would have been a step in the wrong direction. Generally, people have an opportunity to go on to third level for further education. I am glad the day is gone where if one was not the son or daughter of a doctor, a solicitor or a vet, one could not expect to proceed to third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Some may criticise the points system and say it puts pressure on students but there is no better system. Irrespective of one's background, if students do well in examinations and get the necessary points, they get the opportunity to go to college. They should not be debarred from this opportunity simply because of third fees. If they have the intelligence and the points and want to go to third level, every obstacle should be removed and they should be encouraged and helped because these are the people of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">What stood to this county during the past 20 years, and every industrialist who came here made this point, was our well-educated work force. That is why I am glad this foundation is being set up and that the funding is being put in place. However, there must be accountability and I know a report will be laid before the Dáil every year. I do not want to see other quangos developing such as the National Roads Authority and other State agencies where there are jobs for the boys and the girls but no accountability. Instead of the funding being put where it should be, there is discussion of establishing sub-committees here and there. It worries me. We have enough committees in this country, we have enough reports and we have enough people who know what the problems are and what has to be done. We do not need many more committees and State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">We are giving away too many powers to outside agencies which is why I hope Science Foundation Ireland will be accountable to the Dáil. I hope the foundation's annual report will be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts or some other Oireachtas committee. We must bring in the chief executive to go through the reports and every other bit of work Science Foundation Ireland has done over the previous year. Everything that happens in this country should be accounted for to the Dáil. The National Roads Authority should have to come to Leinster House on an annual basis to account for itself rather than attend when invited to do so by committees. The authority should be required in legislation to come before the Dáil and be answerable to its elected Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I listened earlier to Deputy Harkin and I must agree with many of the points she made regarding the IDA and economic development. There has been a bit of a downturn in the economy and already the IDA is running for cover. The IDA and the Government tell us there are people coming here who wish to invest. They want to invest in greenfield sites in the cities, near the universities and in the bigger centres of population. I say to the Government and the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that we must provide for regional development. The IDA and the Department must do what is necessary even if it means creating a bias towards the west of Ireland and rural areas. It should be done through extra employment and other grants if that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Last week, I raised the issue of jobs in Ballinrobe and said that I was disturbed by what happened with the IDA. A man from Wales was prepared to invest in this country by buying a factory in Ballinrobe which the IDA has leased from a family for 35 years. The IDA pays €120,000 per annum for a factory which has been empty for almost 20 years and there is 15 years left on the lease. It would be better to use that money to double the employment grants to bring people to the west of Ireland. The IDA and the Government had an opportunity to do something but they let down the people of Ballinrobe. The IDA tells us that the three priority spots in Mayo are Westport, Castlebar and Ballina as these are the major population centres in the county. Ballinrobe had a factory which was vacant for 20 years and there was a man who was prepared to buy it for €750,000, which was the going rate according to a valuation. The IDA and this man fell out over the employment grant as he was looking for more than the €3,300 which was offered. If the IDA and the Government were committed, we would not have lost that factory last week and there would be jobs today in the black spot of Ballinrobe. The business in question would have started with 25 workers which would have increased to 80 over four years. In a small community 80 jobs mean a great deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Deputy Harkin is correct to state that the west has been deprived of infrastructure since the foundation of the State. We cannot compete with Dublin, Cork or any of the big cities. The N5 from Longford to Strokestown to Westport is not right. The officials within the Department may nod their heads, but major industrialists employing thousands in Mayo are coming to the Minister and the Department every week to explain that their goods are being damaged in transit from those towns to their destinations on the Continent. These companies are experiencing many difficulties simply because goods are being transported along bad roads which damage them. This affects our jobs in the west of Ireland which is why the proper infrastructure must be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">I heard people refer earlier to broadband technology which is the future. A major information technology company was established and operating in Westport on the basis that broadband technology would come to the town. A few weeks ago, I was walking down the street and I saw a lovely sign in the company's window which said that while Westport was a lovely town to do business in with a lovely population, the company regretted that it had to move to Galway due to the absence of broadband. That is wrong and it should not happen. We should be given the same chance as the cities and we should be given the same opportunities to employ people.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">I listened to somebody speak about gas. I attended a recent public meeting on the matter and I make it clear to the House that I want gas to be piped on the basis it is done in the Shetland Islands. The Shetlands are the size of County Mayo, but the locals have control of the site being exploited. A levy is paid for every bit of oil and gas which is piped to pay for the educational system and the hospital system. There are new schools and swimming pools. They have got something out of it because that is where the oil and the gas are coming in. In Mayo there has been a big find.</p>

          <p eId="para_926">Can such provisions be made retrospective? Gas comes into my constituency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_595">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_927">If the Minister of State was doing his job, he would have that done. I am trying to ensure such measures are in place in Mayo when these guys come in for planning permission and there is a problem with the site. The site was sold to a private company by Coillte, a State agency, which is not supposed to sell land unless it is in the public interest to do so. We had the land and the opportunity and we should have made Shell pay a levy to Mayo County Council. The proceeds of that levy should have been spent in Erris to provide infrastructure including roads and swimming pools. I would support the Minister of State in making such demands in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">We do not know where the directors of the multinational companies which come in are, but all they care about is getting the gas out. Taxpayers have to pay to bring the pipeline from north Mayo to Galway. The national grid comes from Dublin to Galway, but it should come the whole way to the west. The former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, negotiated with Shell to bring the pipeline from Erris to Galway, yet to this day we do not know which towns, if any, in Mayo will receive gas. I put down a question on the matter and I was told to write to Bord Gáis which tells me that towns will receive gas if it is feasible and possible to provide it. A natural resource is being taken out of north Mayo at the expense and hardship of the local people while the rewards go to multinationals outside the State. That should not happen. We should be rewarded and the infrastructure should be put in place in north Mayo.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">We should never be ashamed to invest in education and to look to the future. We looked to the future in the past and we were rewarded. I want to see this Bill enacted and to see its provisions working properly to fund research and students in universities. I want us to be ahead of the posse in the future to allow us to address whatever changes take place in society. There is no doubt that what has happened over the last ten years would not have occurred in other countries over 60 or 70 years. There have been major changes. We should never stop people who want to invest in the education system as doing so will pay dividends in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The Minister of State and his Government have in gas a resource which can benefit the country and industry, but the people of Mayo and of Erris deserve to be rewarded for it. I hope the Government is examining that and providing the badly needed infrastructure which Deputy Harkin and I have been talking about for years with regard to roads and water and sewerage schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">Rural areas have much to offer multinational companies. Look at companies such as Allergan Pharmaceuticals. Allergan employs 1,000 people in Westport. Many American companies left this country when the ten-year tax break expired but Allergan did not leave. That company has been here for more than 25 years and has created significant employment, both direct and indirect. Companies have been built around Allergan. One is Berry's Printing Works which last week announced further development. That company was started by a local man in the corner of a shop in Westport and it now employs hundreds of people. That happened because there were American companies such as Allergan, which have been good for the west of Ireland and its people. However, these companies would not have come here unless our people were educated, prepared to work and had the necessary skills to work in these industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Ireland has to be ahead of the posse. We are not competitive at present and have lost ground to our competitors. We must have skilled and trained people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_596">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_933">This Bill affords me an opportunity, like my colleagues from the west, to discuss the competitiveness of that part of the country. I welcome the Bill. It is time to make a considerable investment in biotechnology and ICT research. Future expansion and development in this country will depend on these two areas. If we are to compete with our competitors throughout the world, we must invest in research.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Ireland's contribution to investment in research over the years has been dismal. According to a report in a national newspaper, about 1.2% of our gross domestic product is spent on research. The EU average is 1.8% of GDP and the Community has set a target of 3% of GDP by 2010. We are lagging behind. That is reflected in our overall competitiveness. A number of speakers have referred to the mid-term review submission to the Government by the Institute of Engineers of Ireland on the national development plan. It is worth putting on record how Ireland ranks in various areas. In education and skills, for example, Ireland is ranked eighth of 14 countries, with expenditure of 5.4% of GDP. The Minister for Education and Science and the Taoiseach, when they are challenged at Question Time and on Leaders' Questions about investment in schools and science laboratories in schools, say we are doing well. In fact, we are ranked below average among our main competitors and that investment is continuing to decline.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">Investment in information society infrastructure is considered crucial for future economic growth. However, in terms of broadband provision Ireland is 15th out of 16 countries surveyed. It is 12th out of 16 in terms of Internet users and ninth out of 15 in terms of technology achievement. It is tenth of ten countries surveyed for digital subscription. I tabled a parliamentary question today to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources about the management services entity tender for broadband in this country. People have been waiting for this for some time. Despite the fact that it was promised months ago it might still only appear this week. A number of international companies have been waiting for this and they are growing impatient.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">This happened previously in other areas, for example, with Digico. Companies waited and waited but nothing happened. The general attitude towards Ireland as a country in which to do business is not as positive as it was ten years ago. There are also other issues such as inflation, wage costs and insurance costs where we are out of line with our main competitors. The World Competitiveness Yearbook was published last month. It points to a further deterioration in this country's international competitiveness ranking. It ranks Ireland 28th of 29 countries for maintenance and development of infrastructure and last in the ranking for distribution infrastructure such as roads, trains and planes.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">This country has a major problem. Some years ago, when Ireland was making its case for the last tranche of European funding, I said in the House that we should have carried out an audit of what would be required to upgrade our national primary and secondary roads. We should have gone to Europe and said that if Ireland was to become a First World country, it needed the investment indicated by the audit.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_941">I am not. It is a fact. Ireland has a Third World infrastructure. We rank highly in terms of family income; we are above the European average. However, our basic infrastructure is Third World. Anybody who goes abroad, and many will travel abroad this summer, can see this for themselves and see the progress in Portugal, France and Spain with regard to road provision. Some of our major road networks have deteriorated. Some of these roads were provided 15 years ago and they have not been maintained properly because the money is not available for it. Even if one travels from here to Naas one can see the deterioration of the dual carriageway.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Ireland has a major problem. Our competitiveness is going in only one direction. This Bill is making an effort in the research sector, which is not before time. However, there are warnings. I read another newspaper article recently which quoted the chairwoman of the Irish Research Scientists Association, Dr. Fiona Regan. She said that although Ireland is investing a considerable amount of money, €1.2 million, in research generally under the national development plan, it is most important to get value for money. She said: "We have come on in leaps and bounds for increases in research here, but as IRSA has always said, there is a problem in the way money is being spent."  Deputy Ring also made that point. With regard to the announcement last month that SFI would invest €42 million in just three research centres in Ireland she said:</p>
          <p eId="para_943">I think we need to be careful. I think we can get money better spent than putting it into three centres. Are we actually looking ahead? The way to look ahead is to create a perpetual fund that is independent from economic downturns. Research should never be in a position where it is threatened by a lack of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">This happened even this year as regards university provision. Funding for research in third level institutions is one of the areas in which there was not a cutback but a pause, as it was described. We are now providing the money for research but not for the buildings in which it is carried out. That is a retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I recall the end of the 1980s, when there were major cutbacks. Coming from an agricultural area, I had a particular interest in agriculture. Money for agricultural research by bodies such as Teagasc, formerly ACOT, was cut at that time. It was one of the areas that was targeted. As a result, we did not put the necessary investment into developing products based upon our commodities and fell way behind. That is one of the areas of criticism Commissioner Fischler singled Ireland out for when he visited some time ago. He said that we did not diversify into other products. That is the reason we now lag behind as regards the provision of many commodities based upon our food industry. At that time, we warned the Minister that if he cut back on research, we would suffer down the road as has happened in the past. This is exactly what Dr. Regan is saying – that if we are to remain competitive, there should be a continual revolving fund for research that does not depend on how healthy the economy is at a particular time.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">As a former teacher, I must say that the fall-off in science studies in second level and among graduates in related disciplines at third level is a serious concern. The Minister of State will be familiar with the report of the task force on physical sciences and the third report by the expert group on future skills needs. The message from both is similar – investment is needed at both second and third level in science facilities. As I mentioned, there was a pause this year in investment in third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">Irrespective of what we talk about here – and we will speak about the arts shortly – unless emphasis is placed on science subjects at second level in particular, with an introduction at primary level, we will not create the scientists of the future. Some of the top researchers and scientists in the world are Irish but are not living here. I have met several of them in places like Silicon Valley. They are scattered all over the world. Hopefully, this fund will now bring them back to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">It is very important that they do not come here just here because money is available in the short-term. If that is the case, they will subsequently leave. It will take money to keep them here, but the knowledge they have gained at our expense will be dissipated and disseminated throughout the world if they leave because they cannot be supported here. They must be paid huge wages. Some of these people are head hunted around the world by other research centres. There is a very select group of international researchers and scientists who are part of a very tight network. They communicate with each other all of the time. If somebody is doing very valuable research here that may be needed elsewhere, he or she can be lured out of this country. That is why it is very important that we retain these people in this country when a particular programme is finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">I certainly welcome this Bill which represents the direction we must take. If we are to remain competitive, we have to keep pace with all our competitors, including people in the Silicon Valley or down around San Diego, where the biotechnology industry is really buoyant. Irrespective of where our competitors are, we must do the research here.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">I listened to Deputy Gogarty who obviously has an interest in this whole area and he emphasised exactly the same point – that we must try to encourage these people to stay at home and make their contribution to this country. I have some first hand experience of how research into food products can create a very vibrant company. I live very close to Kerry Ingredients which has a special unit attached to its manufacturing plant in Listowel. It is in that little unit that they have researched most of their 10,000 product lines. I marvel at that little prefab unit in which the company has done most of its research into food ingredients. It is the biggest food ingredients speciality producer in the world and continues to grow because from the very beginning, it put an emphasis on scientific research from which it is now benefiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I know this issue is in the Minister of State's hands. From speaking to him about science in the past, I know he has a very active and genuine interest in this area and I wish him the best in implementing the Bill's provisions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_601">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_952">I thank all the Members of the House for their valuable contributions. I was here all day and the debate was an excellent one. I appreciate the support from all sides of the House for the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">I shall address some of the points made during the debate. About ten years ago, around 1992 and 1993, I was a Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, and the first real investment in research and development came about at that time. I hasten to add that it was not really I who started it but I happened to be <i>in situ </i>at the time. Programmes were put in place then for advanced technology. The investment was mainly aimed at that stage in research and development in industry, and it drove a lot of the development of the last ten to 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">I am glad to be here on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to reply to the debate that has taken place on the setting up Science Foundation Ireland, which is vitally important for the next phase of our industrial development. During the course of the debate, Deputies Hogan and Howlin referred to intellectual property and patenting issues. Intellectual property will be an important output of the research funded by the foundation but the most important output will be the quality of the people attracted, engaged and developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">Science Foundation Ireland has developed detailed terms and conditions which attach to its grants. These outline clearly the conditions which apply in relation to the ownership and commercialisation of intellectual property. It would not be appropriate to copperfasten these terms and conditions in legislation as that level of detail is more appropriately determined by the board to be appointed. Flexibility is also required to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise. The terms and conditions provide that ownership of intellectual property resulting from a research programme shall be vested in the research body subject to compliance by the body with the requirements of the foundation.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">In the event that, resulting from the project, intellectual property exists which could be exploited or commercialised, the research body shall share equally with the foundation all royalties, equity participation and other returns accruing to the research body regarding the exploitation and management of the intellectual property after costs and other necessary deductions are made. Commercialisation of intellectual property is an important issue for Ireland. A working group under the aegis of the Irish Council for Science Technology and Innovation, ICSTI, has examined the issue and recently published a statement. The group concluded that a legislative approach was not necessary in Ireland at this time. Work is recommended, and is progressing, on a code of best practice on the subject. Enterprise Ireland, with IDA Ireland, SFI, Forfás, the Higher Education Authority and Health Research Board also has a project under way designed to strengthen the commercialisation structures in research performers, primarily the universities and institutes of technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">A number of Deputies expressed concern about the ethical aspects of science, such as stem cell research. I would emphasise that any research undertaken in Ireland must comply with Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution which states: "The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right."  Science Foundation Ireland will operate to the highest ethical standards and has adopted the code applied by the long-established Health Research Board in this regard. Legislating for these issues would not be appropriate to this Bill Any legislation would be much broader and would have to apply to all areas where ethical issues arise and deal with ethical standards generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The Minister for Health and Children has a lead role with regard to ethics in the areas referred to by Deputy John Bruton and others and, in March 200, established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction to, "prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account when determining public policy in this area."  It is expected that this autumn, the commission will publish its report on the possible approaches to regulation in this area. Its report should provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">In addition, the Irish Council for Bioethics was established in 2002 as an independent body under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy to consider the ethical issues raised by developments in biotechnology. The council will identify and interpret the ethical questions raised by biological and medical research in order to respond to, and anticipate, questions of substantive concern. It will investigate and report on such questions in the interests of promoting public understanding, informed discussion and education and will stimulate discussion through conferences, workshops, lectures, published reports and, where appropriate, suggested guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Deputy Howlin queried the status of the Health Research Board as regards the foundation. It is important in the transition to a knowledge-based economy that the links between all research bodies, education institutions, academia and industry are fostered and strengthened. In a small country with limited and scarce resources, such collaboration will be important moving forward. This issue is well recognised in the constituent elements of the scientific and research community in Ireland. For example, SFI makes every effort to work in partnership with other research funding agencies and all third level institutions to raise the quality and increase the amount of research undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The necessity to ensure ongoing funding for SFI was stressed. The funding allocated to the foundation for 2003 is €70 million and is double that for 2002. This was done in the context of a reduction in overall spending by my Department. Building capability in research and development is a priority which has to be supported consistently and in the long-term. In response to a query by Deputy Howlin, to date, €59 million has been drawn down by the foundation. As a new entity establishing new programmes never before implemented in Ireland, it was important to take some time to develop the best models which will ensure excellence in funded research. SFI grants will only be rewarded where the projects are of a sufficiently high quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Reference was made to the importance of the institutes of technology. I am supportive of them and their role in regional development and linking research closely with industry. Through Enterprise Ireland, over €22 million has been allocated to build up the research capabilities in the institutes of technology, in particular, through the establishment of incubation facilities. Research projects from institutes of technology are, of course, eligible to apply for SFI funding, provided they are of the required high standard. Indeed, institutes of technology in Dublin, Cork and Waterford have already been awarded funding by SFI.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">Deputy John Bruton queried the statutory basis on which the foundation was set up in 2000. Section 19 of the Industrial Development Act 1993, as amended by section 46 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, provides that the board of Forfás may establish committees to assist and advise it regarding the performance of any of its functions. Section 10 also allows the board to delegate to a committee any of its functions which, in its opinion, can be better or more conveniently exercised or performed by a committee. Science Foundation Ireland was established as a committee of Forfás pending the enactment of specific legislation to establish the foundation as a separate legal entity, and Forfás delegated authority to the foundation to administer research grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Enright referred to the accountability of SFI and the content of its annual report. The foundation will be open and transparent in all its activities. Section 14(3) provides that the director general, if requested, will account for the performance of the foundation to any Oireachtas committee and will have regard for any recommendation made by that committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">Deputy Upton stressed the need for an equitable balance between men and women on the board. There is a Government guideline to the effect that State boards should have 40% representation of women and we do our utmost to ensure that women are well represented on such boards. The Minister will take the views expressed into account in selecting the best available individuals to serve on this important board.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Deputy Upton also queried whether the director general should be a member of the board. The provision that the director general should be a member of the board is in line with other industrial development legislation establishing Forfás, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. As with any other issue, where a conflict of interest might arise with a board member relating to the topic to be discussed, the director general can absent him or her from that discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">A number of Deputies spoke of the importance of making science attractive to students and providing careers for science graduates. The decline in numbers attracted to science subjects in the education system is a cause of great concern. Our competitive position is now threatened by the decline in the take-up of science subjects at both second and third level. The availability of a young educated workforce with the necessary skills has been central to our recent economic success. As Ireland becomes less of a low cost location in the coming years, we must ensure that our skills base is rich in technological, scientific, and research capability. The Government has sought to address the issues surrounding skills supply through the establishment of the expert group on future skills needs and the task force on the physical sciences. The task force has recommended that all the science promotional activities, including the science technology and innovation awareness programme run by Forfás on behalf of my Department, should be drawn together to maximise effectiveness. My Department supports this proposal and, with Forfás, is working to progress the issue over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Deputy Carey referred to the need for the interactive science centre. We are fully committed to the establishment of a science centre, as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government. It is important to making science interesting and attractive for young people. My Department has received a proposal from a number of interested parties seeking funding for the establishment of a science centre and these are being examined at present. However, there are significant cost implications associated with the establishment of such a centre which require particular consideration in the current economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">One of the foundation's roles is to develop the human talent that drives discovery, innovation and prosperity. The foundation will work with its fellow Irish research funding agencies to invest in national and regional facilities that ensure productive and globally-competitive research environments. Such investment will not only advance Ireland's science and engineering capacities, but will also help develop, retain and attract highly-skilled researchers. The support of SFI will enable research careers to be realistic and rewarding choices and thereby help attract the best students to science.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Deputy Eamon Ryan queried why the emphasis is on the economy and suggested that the remit should be broadened to include environment, ecology and society. A small economy such as Ireland's cannot invest without limit in all areas of research, technology and innovation. ICSTI's technology foresight report concluded that spending should focus on those areas that can contribute most to Ireland's long-term economic development. It stated that this could be achieved by investing in research and development personnel of world class research excellence at the critical mass required to give Ireland an international reputation in selected technological niches and, in particular, in information and communication technologies and biotechnology. However, while the foundation will concentrate on these areas initially, there is provision in section 7 of the Bill for the Minister to prescribe other areas that concern economic and social benefit, long-term industrial competitiveness or environmentally sustained development, should this become necessary in the future. This is designed to allow future technology foresight exercises or evolving circumstances to redirect the key focus of the foundation in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Deputy Eoin Ryan suggested a tax credit system such as that in the UK. The possibility of a research and development tax credit is under discussion with the Department of Finance and the Minister, Mr. McCreevy, referred to this issue when speaking on the Finance Bill earlier this year. Deputy Morgan stressed the need for indigenous companies to get involved in research and development and I fully agree with the Deputy that our long-term prosperity and continued growth depends on our indigenous companies. We must increase the number of companies performing effective research and development and embed a research and development culture in companies. The pace of technological change is continuing to accelerate. Companies must continually develop new products and find new markets if they are to keep up. Support is available through Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to firms to help them to develop innovative products, services and processes and encourage them to access and exploit research and development and technology from international sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">Among these programmes are the RTI initiative, which supports high quality speculative research and development projects within SMEs and the research and development capability scheme which supports large scale investment to build up the research and development infrastructure, both human and capital, within new and existing firms. We must change from being an economy which produces goods and services based on ideas and knowledge generated elsewhere to one which generates knowledge and innovative ideas from investment in our own research. This can be achieved both by attracting creative individuals with advanced research experience in the fields of ICT and biotechnology to Ireland, and by fostering home-grown talent.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Deputy Crowe raised a question about an all-Ireland dimension. Researchers from all over the world, including Northern Ireland, may be funded by SFI which is already collaborating with institutions such as Queen's University Belfast, and whose present board has one member from Northern Ireland. The Deputy also raised questions about SFI's activities. I can assure him that these will be closely monitored by the Department and a report on the foundation's activities covering the projects being funded will be laid before the House each year. A report on activities to date will be published next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Deputy Harkin raised the issue of promoting top class research in the regions. A total of €19.5 million has already been granted to NUI, Galway. Deputy Crawford raised a question about the accountability of the director general and I have already referred to that in dealing with Deputy Enright's question. Deputy Twomey asked about ownership of intellectual property and commercialisation and I have referred to those issues earlier in my speech. In today's economy natural resources, cheap labour or capital stock are not as important to national comparative advantage as innovation built on new ideas and new knowledge. Government investment is aimed at building up that comparative advantage. We do not underestimate the challenge that is facing the foundation and we have faced such challenges in the past when we first began to attract high technology investment. The intention now is to develop a research environment that will compete with the best in the world in the strategic niche areas. I am confident that the foundation has the experience and the drive that will enable it to meet the challenges this new era presents.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">As Deputy Deenihan has rightly pointed out, the Kerry Group has proved that research and development pays and I can put in a plug for my own constituency, which is also that of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Sherlock, where there is a similar research and development area in Moorepark in Fermoy which has proved successful. SFI will bring about the results that will continue the growth and development of this economy. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">The Minister mentioned that local authorities play a very important role in promoting the arts at regional and local level. Most local authorities now have a five year arts plan. They are also funded through the Arts Act, some more than others. They are becoming the engine for local and community arts development. I know, for example, that the arts officer in Kerry County Council has a very small budget but nevertheless is doing very important work. As a result of such initiative and enthusiasm, the arts are flourishing in Kerry. The purpose of the amendment is to give a commitment that local authorities should provide such financial or other assistance as they consider appropriate to such persons in respect of such activities and projects undertaken for those purposes. In my experience, the word "may" leaves matters very open. The word "shall" is more prescriptive, and would mean more of an onus on local authorities. Some local authorities, including the members, are extremely generous towards the arts.</p>

          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_988">Issues around mental health services usually generate little debate and arouse relatively little public attention. That is one reason that we from time to time come across reports which are critical of services. Unfortunately, our attitude to those with a mental illness historically has been negative and ill-informed and has contributed in no small way to the poor quality of service provision until recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">Having said that, it is fair to acknowledge that, over the last quarter of a century, considerable progress has been made and over the last seven to ten years that has been dramatic. There are some outstanding professionals working in the area, and even in the days when the approach was less enlightened, there were wonderful professionals working with people with mental illness, as well as very dedicated campaigners, all of whom made a very positive contribution. Unfortunately, the service delivered was quite uneven across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">One of the improvements seen in recent years is that the standard has been raised all round, and the service has become more uniform across the country. It is one of the areas where expenditure under the health budget has made a positive contribution. In that regard, I welcome the commitment of the Ministers, Deputies Martin and O'Malley, who were here last night, to address outstanding problems and issues and continue to give this area of health the priority it needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The move from ancient, forbidding, Dickensian buildings to modern acute facilities and community-based services has been a tremendous success. I have experienced it in my own area of County Clare, where the huge old mental institution at Our Lady's Hospital has thankfully been closed and replaced by an acute unit in the grounds of Ennis General Hospital. There are also many excellent community facilities. One occasionally hears suggestions that the level of support or manpower around some community facilities might be greater for those who have been de-institutionalised. That area is among those currently being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">The Mid-Western Health Board frequently comes in for criticism, but this is one area where considerable credit is due to it and its chief executive officer, who vigorously pursued the modernisation process in mental health. This was successful in my own county. The fact that the acute unit is now on the campus of the general hospital has helped mainstream mental illness as an ordinary ailment. It is realised that a full recovery is likely for the vast majority, and people are much readier to seek professional and medical advice at a stage at which they would not previously have countenanced it. One of the scandals has been that many people with intellectual disabilities and acquired brain injuries have been forced to live in unsuitable mental institutions. Our growing problem in the area of acquired brain injury is putting a massive strain on resources. We have nowhere near a sufficient level of service, and that must urgently be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">There has also been considerable public debate on the issue of suicide and the need to address the causes and develop strategies to recognise those at risk. We should acknowledge the positive role of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals over the years and also the Amnesty International report, Mental Illness – The Neglected Quarter, which in some sense begot this debate. Some would say that the report is 20 or 50 years too late, but it is better late than never, and it is high time that some of the issues raised were addressed. I refer in particular to homelessness which is difficult to deal with at a health or national level. The input of the voluntary sector has been positive, and we should support it strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">It is also fair to say that it is easy to debate mental illness and prescribe all kinds of remedies. However, society generally, and probably even we in the House, should acknowledge that we have not been good at maintaining contact with those who are mentally ill and have been consigned to institutions – or those who now live in the community. That is one of the great failures of Irish society and must urgently be addressed. Perhaps the most significant progress made in recent times has been the Mental Health Act 2001 and the setting up of the Mental Health Commission, which will ensure that our service reaches the highest international standards.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_609">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_995">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and say there are many good things happening in health. I acknowledge that there are gaps in certain services. As Minister of State with special responsibility for older people, I have a particular concern about services for the elderly mentally ill, and I wish to focus in particular on developments in the psychiatry of later life.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">As Deputies may be aware, there are now more than 60 million people in the European Union aged 65 or over. One in five of the population of the EU is an older citizen, and the ratio is set to rise to one in four quite rapidly. In Ireland, estimates suggest that, by the year 2011, our population aged 65 and over will have grown by 25%. Each year our over 65 population increases by approximately 6,000, and the number of people aged 80 and over goes up by 1,500. Inevitably, that will give rise to an increase in the number of older people suffering from mental illness and will present a major challenge to our mental health services in coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">In his most recent report, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals noted that 40% of in-patients in psychiatric units and hospitals are over 65, and in some instances, particularly among long-stay patients, that figure exceeds 50%. According to the inspector, many of them show little sign of behavioural disturbance related to psychiatric disorder and, among the more elderly in particular – something that I believe reflected society's thinking at the time of their admittance – their needs and disabilities relate instead to their age. The inspector has stressed the need to transfer their care either to community residences, where possible, or to suitable in-patient continuing care facilities for older persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">I assure the House that the provision of appropriate care for older people is a key priority, both for me as Minister of State and for this Government. The increase in the number of people living to an advanced age requires the development, as a priority, of specialist mental health services to meet their specific needs. The psychiatric needs of older people include specialist services for those with functional mental illness and those with dementia and associated behavioural problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">In 1996 the National Council on Ageing and Older People published the results of a study on mental disorder in older people in Ireland undertaken by the Health Research Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The report focused on the mental health of older people and examined the treatments available to those with mental disorder. In line with the results of that study, psychiatric services for older people have been expanded in recent years and the integration of community and hospital-based psychiatric services with geriatric medicine is progressing. Over €7 million additional revenue funding has been committed since 1999 to enable a start to be made on the establishment of specialist services for the elderly mentally ill in health boards where no such service had heretofore existed. A total of 17 consultant-led teams specialising in psychiatry of later life are now in place around the country and a further four consultants have been approved by the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">In relation to health services for older people in general, additional revenue funding for the development of these services has increased significantly from €12.7 million in 1997 to an additional €87.807 million in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">In excess of €270 million additional funding has been provided for services for older people from 1997 to date. This has resulted in more than 1,000 additional staff being recruited. Between 1998 and 2001 in excess of 550 additional beds were provided in new community nursing units and more than 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">In 2003, a total of €23.6 million in additional revenue funding was allocated to services to older people. This funding is being used for a variety of services including home help service; nursing home subvention; support to carers; opening new community nursing units; development of dementia services; funding of day care centres and development of consultant-led services. The continued development of these services for older people is a key priority for the Government and we will continue to work with the health boards to ensure the provision of a comprehensive service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">A very significant development in addressing the mental health needs of older persons was the establishment of the dementia services information and development centre in St. James's Hospital, by the Department of Health and Children in 1998. This centre serves as a resource for professionals and service planners. Through its education, research, consultancy and information services, its remit is to promote excellence in all aspects of dementia care. I am aware that since its establishment the centre has facilitated a wide range of education workshops nationally, for care staff working in a large variety of settings. I recognise we have a lot of work to do in providing services to people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's, although I am pleased the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland received a 25% increase in its core grant from my Department this year. That shows the importance I attach to this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Throughout the country other service initiatives are also being explored, such as the development of "in home" respite care, a service which we know is particularly welcomed by family carers because it means that their relatives are offered respite in a familiar environment. As the population of older people here in Ireland increases, we should not forget that our elders have been instrumental in building the Irish State to the prosperous level we enjoy today. Their full measured contribution to the economy is widely acknowledged and this Government is fully committed to improving all aspects of their lives by focusing on issues that affect their well-being.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_610">

          <p eId="para_1006">I thank my Fianna Fáil colleagues for sharing their time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">We will never see the day when we can say we have done all we can for people with disabilities. There will always be more to be done, as every public representative and person caring for family members with disabilities knows. If we are to be fair, we will ask ourselves if we are making progress with providing services for those with disabilities and we will recognise progress when it is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">We have been making progress in this area in recent years, particularly in services for people with intellectual disabilities, and yesterday the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, set out that progress. No-one could deny it. In the past five years, an additional 1,700 community residential places have been provided and almost 3,000 new day care places have been added. Families have also benefited from 465 new respite residential places in the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">No-one is saying this is all that needs to be done but it is certainly progress. I do not expect the Opposition to stop opposing the Government for a minute but I expect it to have the decency and self-respect not to claim it is the only who cares about people with disabilities. The Opposition should not ignore the progress we have made. It does no service to people with disabilities and their families to whip up an antagonistic, confrontational and bitter atmosphere surrounding disability services. Yet that is the behaviour of the Opposition and certain non-elected people associated with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">I agree with the warning to politicians not to use the Special Olympics for photo opportunities or publicity; my party and the Government have no intention of using the Special Olympics for political publicity. We should leave politics out of sport and the Special Olympics in particular. This view is clearly not shared by the <i>chef de cabinet</i> of the Labour Party who uses his weekly media bully pulpit to put the Special Olympics into the same frame as his predictable criticisms of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Last Tuesday he urged the Taoiseach and the Government to seize the moment of the Special Olympics to provide an extra €50 million for disability services. This sounds like advising the Government to use the Special Olympics for the purposes of political propaganda. If a Minister were to take this free advice and make announcements on the back of the Special Olympics the same Labour Party would be the quickest to condemn him or her in its highest moral tones. Does the Labour Party approve of the politicisation of the Special Olympics or will it undertake not to politicise the games like the rest of us? Who is the real spokesperson on health and disability issues in the Labour Party?</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">The Labour Party <i>chef de cabinet </i>had the opportunity over many years to be tetchy for the Tánaiste of the rainbow coalition. It is a pity he was not more tetchy about disability funding then, when he could have prodded Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left into providing better funding for disability services. The total budget for disability health services was under €400 million when that coalition left office. There was a Labour Minister for Finance and a Fine Gael Minister for Health, with a brooding Tánaiste's office checking everything out. Now the budget is three times bigger, with €1.1 billion being spent on disability – an increase of €160 million on last year's figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">It is also pretty low politics to complain now about the number of people who need intellectual disability services. When the rainbow coalition left office it had no idea how many people needed such services; it did not know who or where they were or what they needed. There was no national intellectual disability database such as exists now, with almost 90% of those on the database receiving services. That does not solve everything but it is progress no-one can deny. The situation is much better than when Fine Gael and Labour had their chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The way in which Labour and Fine Gael are criticising the Government on disability issues does not make for constructive Opposition. It is not policy-based and it is not principled, caring or moral. It does no good for people with disabilities and offers no solutions. That is why I support the Government amendment to the motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1016">I intend to support the Special Olympics. There will be pitch and putt in Glenville in Tallaght and basketball in the National Basketball Arena. I intend to attend – to pay my way through the turnstiles and support my neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">I congratulate Deputy Neville on his work, particularly on suicide prevention. I attended a youth conference exhibition in the Mansion House where I picked up a copy of an information booklet on suicide prevention for young people published by the National Youth Federation – I am a former press officer for that organisation. The booklet outlines the work being done in this area and I support Deputy Neville in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">I use my experiences in my constituency in my contributions and I often speak about Tallaght. It was my privilege to be a member of the Eastern Regional Health Authority until recently and I was also a member of the Eastern Health Board from 1994. In 1999, the Eastern Health Board produced a report, We Have No Beds, and the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, was the board chairman who launched the report. The report stated there were sufficient acute beds in the region but that many were taken up by people who did not need acute care. The term "bed blocker" is often used in regard to such people. However, I take the view that they are not bed blockers but rather continue to provide an example to all in this House of what urgently needs to be done, namely, a range of community based services which would intervene in a positive way at an early stage to prevent acute illness and which can equally be available after acute illness must be put in place. We must do this by continuing to invest and by developing the partnership with the voluntary sector. I have no doubt that the Government will do just that. I have been greatly impressed by the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in this regard. I greeted him in Tallaght recently at a function organised by Enable Ireland and I applaud his work in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">For quite some time I have been supportive of the mental health services in Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the country. As some Members will know, we have two 25 bed acute in-patient units at Tallaght Hospital. A mental health day care centre and hospital was opened in 1988 and these facilities on the Belgard Road are being upgraded and will be ready in August of this year. There is also an out-patients' clinic at Mary Mercer Centre, Jobstown, and Tallaght is greatly served by consultants on those teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">A high support hostel, Beaufort House, was opened in 2000. New Horizons, a vocational training workshop, is operated by EVE Holdings at Broomhills industrial estate in Tallaght. Clients from Tallaght also attend the recently opened club house project – Phoenix Club House – in nearby Clondalkin which was opened last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">There are challenges and needs in Tallaght, as there are elsewhere. Recognising the population expansion and the social needs of Tallaght, the mental health services have told me they require two multi-disciplinary home care teams to provide an assertive, outreach model of care in the client's home. They also need additional rehabilitation accommodation options to improve patient flow through the acute units, which is important. We need an out-patients' clinic to serve east Tallaght and a second club house in Tallaght, which would be especially helpful. We also need additional staffing for the six bed Aspen psychiatry unit for old age at Tallaght Hospital. I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, expressing his support in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Tallaght also needs a mental health liaison team to work at the hospital, particularly in the accident and emergency department responding to needs of acute presentation and para-suicidal patients. Specialist services required include psychotherapy, eating disorder, obsessive compulsive disorders and personality disorder programmes. An extended alcohol service programme to include a staff training facility is also needed. I understand from my local contacts that an academic post to develop the research and training aspects of the service is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">It is important we support those in our community who need our help and for whom we should care. It behoves all of us to continue to express our support for these services to Government. The Minister and the Ministers of State are listening and I have confidence that they will deliver the services because it is important to do so. It is important that we take action to correct the perception which exists among some of the groups. I support these groups and it is important we understand what they are saying, the challenges faced by the services and that we do what we can in difficult economic times to continue to serve those in our community who need us.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1024">I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important matter. Like Deputy O'Connor, I congratulate Deputy Neville on tabling this motion. The issue under discussion is one which affects a group of people who would not have had a voice in the past. It behoves all of us to raise at every opportunity the need to improve services for people with a mental disability. I read the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley's, speech, which was very strong. I know of his personal commitment to improving the level of services needed throughout the country. The Minister of State stated at the outset of his contribution last night that nobody is saying the services are adequate. We need more services and facilities. I am sure that in the coming years, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, with his strong and caring leadership will ensure that the necessary funding is provided and that the additional facilities and services are provided throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Deputy Killeen mentioned the problem of homelessness. I suppose it is an issue for which we could all accept blame in not addressing it adequately over the years. Were it not for organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul and other voluntary groups, the plight and the number of homeless would be much more severe. Great credit is due to the many voluntary organisations. Often in a parish or town, a handful of people ensure a place to stay and basic comforts are provided for people who have fallen on difficult times. All of us know of individual cases and the people concerned. Unfortunately, there is a recurring theme of these people falling out of favour with society, often as a result of the abuse of alcohol. Unfortunately, it is an issue which is brought to our attention because at times, there is not adequate provision for the treatment of people suffering from alcohol abuse. Better services need to be provided at our general hospital or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">Last year the Minister, Deputy Martin, appointed Dr. John Owens, the consultant psychiatrist and former clinical director of the Cavan-Monaghan Mental Health Service, as chairperson of the new commission established as a result of the Mental Health Act 2001. All of us, particularly those of us from the Cavan-Monaghan region and those who have taken an interest in the delivery of health services throughout the country, will be aware of the pioneering work and models and systems put in place by Dr. Owens. We hope that his leadership and the style of care and delivery of service he has provided in the Cavan-Monaghan area can be improved and replicated throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, stated that mental incapacity can often be associated with people growing old and that there is a higher dependence among the elderly. An issue which has been brought to the attention of those of us who represent rural constituencies, in particular, is the plight of many of our emigrants living in Britain or in the United States, and Deputy Cowley has been active in this regard. I come from an area which was totally devastated by depopulation over the years and in which parishes were practically wiped out. Those of us who maintain contact with our county associations throughout Britain and the United States know that a particular age group of emigrants face hardship. Some local authorities and many voluntary agencies have done Trojan work in ensuring that housing is provided in these people's native area in order to allow them to come home. Thankfully, emigration has been much reduced, if not eliminated, in recent years. That means the age profile of our emigrants, whether in Birmingham, London, Coventry, elsewhere in Britain or in New York or Boston, in particular, is very high. Those people left this country when there was no living to be made and many of them reared families back home by sending home dollars or sterling. Those people have been left vulnerable and isolated. I hope the Minister will ensure better co-ordination among local authorities in providing housing for people who wish to come home to their native area – people who are vulnerable, isolated and living in lonely circumstances in many of the cities to which Irish people travelled in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">As the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, said, those people and those who remained at home worked in very difficult times and, in many instances, barely eked out a living. With a well developed economy and a standard of living to which that generation thought we could never aspire, there should be an obligation on us to try to improve the housing circumstances of those who wish to return home. I know from speaking to representatives of many of our emigrant associations that mental difficulties are a recurring theme among many of the elderly people living in bedsits or small flats throughout Britain and the United States. I hope the Minister's Department is in a position to drive a housing scheme for emigrants involving all local authorities, particularly in the counties that suffered from huge depopulation over the years.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1031">The issue of mental health is best looked at from the perspective of human rights. Responsibility for compliance with international human rights law lies firmly with the Government. It does not lie with the health boards, civil servants, service providers or individual Departments. The buck stops with the Minister and he must make the decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">Recent reports by Amnesty International have shown that in-patient and community based services are inadequate in many respects, inconsistent in their application throughout the country and severely under-resourced in terms of staff and funding. The most compelling statistic is the massive drop in overall funding devoted to mental health services. Total expenditure over the past 15 years has dropped from 12% of the overall health budget to 7.2%. Obviously, there has been a significant increase in the overall health budget, but to see the provision for mental health services drop so dramatically – by approximately 40% – is disturbing. The problem needs to be addressed by central Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness were adopted in 1991. Although they are not legally binding, they mirror the basic rights and freedoms outlined in the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. The Mental Health Act 2001 was passed to amend the scenario whereby people with mental illness can be detained involuntarily in psychiatric facilities by procedures that fail to protect against arbitrary detention. Under the current regulations, a person can be detained for up to 21 days. This period, which is far too long, should be shortened and the Green Party wants to see this happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">It was interesting to be present some weeks ago at the launch of Amnesty International's report on mental illness and homelessness. Moreover, it was interesting to hear Dr. Fernandez, director of the homelessness programme at St. Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital in Dublin, make a very passionate plea for an increase in funding and for a change of heart and dedication to the cause of addressing the lack of services in this area. He made the very interesting point that a distinction must be drawn between mental health problems induced by homelessness and mental illness which may be a factor in one's becoming or remaining homeless. These are two separate issues, yet we do not have the resources needed to provide the correct services in this regard. I am interested to hear the views of the Minister of State on how this can be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners state that sick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialised institutions or to civic hospitals. The problem is that those facilities do not exist. We have the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum but it is not enough to cope with the variety of patients. Prisoners are often discharged into a state of homelessness and receive little or no after-care. This should be addressed by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">We are concerned at the failure to provide the mental health policy update, promised for mid-2003 under the national health strategy of 2001. We are worried that we will simply see an updating of the 1984 document. It is crucial that the Minister holds the meeting with Amnesty International, postponed because of the SARS outbreak, to discuss the relevant issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Recent publicity on health has failed to refer to mental health, nor has mental health been included in the initiatives in the health strategy. We want to see an improvement in this area. There has been no commitment to providing extra Revenue funding, which we would like to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The Minister for Health and Children has been heading a very high profile media defence of the health system and his activities to date in the Department, yet he has not mentioned the long-standing crisis in mental health services. We are concerned at the kind of signal this sends to the public about the importance of this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">There are four things we want: a meeting between the Minister and the various organisations; a public education and awareness campaign to combat the stigma of mental illness; rights based disability and mental health legislation to give full effect to international human rights obligations; and adequate funding for all areas of mental health.</p>

          <p eId="para_1040">Ar son Teachtaí Sinn Féin, ba mhaith liom tacú go hiomlán leis an rún seo ar shláinte intinne. Molaim freisin an Teachta Neville ach go háirithe as é a chur os ár gcomhair. On behalf of the Sinn Féin Deputies, I fully support the motion and commend Deputy Neville in particular for bringing it before the Dáil. The Deputy has repeatedly highlighted the issue of mental health over the past six years and I am glad to see that its scandalous neglect is now being exposed to a wider audience and that, at last, we are having a full-scale debate. Let us hope that real and concerted Government action will follow because that is the purpose of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Amnesty International report on mental health care, which has already been referred to, is a real wake-up call. It is so important because it places the rights of people suffering mental illness at the top of the agenda. I was present at a recent meeting in the Mansion House when the representative of Amnesty International spoke in very particular terms on this issue. I commend that contribution, and the work of the organisation in this area is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">For too long, the mentally ill have been without rights and without a voice. The Amnesty International report reveals how mental health has been treated as the Cinderella of the health services. Current policy is based on an outdated review going back to 1984. This is an indictment of successive Governments but it is also a call to action and an opportunity for the Government to begin to get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">People with mental health problems are stigmatised by society and denied the full range of effective treatments because of under-resourcing, a lack of proper training and inadequate strategies to deal with mental health in our health services. Our rate of involuntary admissions to psychiatric facilities is higher than the European average. The rights of people as citizens and as service users are not being protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Following criticism of Irish mental health provisions by the United Nations last year, Amnesty International's report identified how far short of international standards this State falls, especially given our recent level of economic prosperity. During our economic boom, I believe our standards and performance were particularly poor and very regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I join in the tributes to Dr. John Owens and Dr. Teresa Carey, who has succeeded him at the helm of St. Davnet's Hospital in Monaghan. They have pioneered community based treatment. The failure to take on board the merits of this approach in other parts of the jurisdiction has resulted in the totally inappropriate use of prisons as unofficial mental hospitals. According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, approximately 40% of all prisoners suffer from mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The vast majority of these are serving time for minor, non-violent offences, often connected with their illness. Frequently, these people come into conflict with the law only after years of going without proper clinical treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Such people need and have the right to adequate clinical care. Instead, they find themselves imprisoned and often subjected to solitary confinement in lieu of treatment or proper care. They inevitably deteriorate further in prison. The cycle of deterioration often includes homelessness on release, and we have many examples of that in this city, which in itself becomes an exacerbating factor. Cycles of recidivism are virtually guaranteed in such cases. The Government must end the policy of incarcerating people suffering from mental illness. This policy has resulted in a <i>de facto</i> criminalisation of the mentally ill, and is a violation of their human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">In conclusion, I acknowledge the role of the Psychiatric Nurses Association in highlighting the disgraceful neglect of the mentally ill. It points to the decline in spending on mental health as a percentage of gross Government expenditure on health, from 13.5% in 1976 to a paltry 7.2% in 2001. That is a damning statistic and revealing fact. The PNA points also to the need to ensure adequate staffing levels are maintained and that the appalling conditions patients are forced to endure in some of our institutions are addressed and redressed. I commend and support Deputy Neville's motion.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_618">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1049">I am glad to support this important motion and I thank Deputy Neville for proposing it. I was interested to hear the Minister say that in his most recent report the Inspector of Mental Hospitals noted that 40% of inpatients in psychiatric units were over 65 years of age and that in some instances, particularly among long-stay patients, the figure exceeds 50%. The inspector has stressed the need to transfer their care either to community residences, where possible, or to suitable inpatient continuing care facilities for older persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">Many years ago the Green Paper on psychiatric services said the same thing. It said that the majority of long-stay people in institutions are over 65 years of age. Long-stay means people are there for a year or over. Those people should be at home in their own community but they are not because there is not sufficient provision for them in their community. Deputy Neville's motion spells out for us that because of the lack of facilities in the community people are in psychiatric hospitals who should not be there. That is the bottom line no matter how it is dressed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">In my own area I became involved in what we call St. Brendan's Village which is about supporting people in their own community. It is about providing a community alternative to incarceration in institutions. People who killed people end up in jail for four to eight years but people are incarcerated for life in mental hospitals. These people are not murderers or anything like that but they have an illness. They deserve a chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The answer is St. Brendan's Village type developments. Such developments are in the community and cost a third of the cost of a State institution to build and only half the cost to run. Even if they cost twice or ten times as much they would be better because people want to be in their own community. However, the icing on the cake is that they do not cost more but are cost effective. There should be a St. Brendan's Village in every town and village in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">When I came to Mulrany as a general practitioner I discovered people needed to see me more as a person than as a doctor. There is a lot of loneliness and depression in our country. As the Minister pointed out, in eight years time the population over 65 years of age will have increased by 25%. That is a lot of people. What will we do with them? They should be supported in their own community because that is the right thing to do. It is also cost effective to do so. Money is the god but it can be done. In St. Brendan's Village, not alone have we stopped the sad side of migration of older people to institutions but we have reversed it and brought people back into the community. We went into institutions and found the people from our area and brought them back into the community. These were people who could not otherwise have left the institution because there was no place for them to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The inspector is right in saying that the vast majority of these people should be at home in their own community. If there was a St. Brendan's Village there would be a place for them. It is said that doing something that is right brings a spin-off. St. Brendan's Village is the biggest employer in our village, employing 65 people, 25 of whom are on community employment. It is a powerful economic regenerator and should be supported. We get some support through the health board from the Department of Health and Children. However, we are red circled or ring-fenced in that there is no defined revenue funding scheme. This is something that should be brought to Cabinet. There should be a defined revenue funding scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">Supporting people in their own community makes a lot more sense and is a lot more cost effective than putting people up in profit driven non-community nursing homes. It is a win-win situation. If the Government continues to support disability as it should, children too will not have to be incarcerated in institutions but can be supported in their community. It makes sense to support people in their community and to give them the supports they need. The real winners will be the people. We are an ageing population and are getting older. Our day will come too. I would much prefer to stay in my own community than to live in an institution where people lose heart and die before their time.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_1056">Amnesty recently issued a report, Mental Illness – The Neglected Quarter. My first reaction was one of shock when I heard Amnesty was becoming involved in mental health affairs. I was surprised because I thought Amnesty was a body involved in international issues such as human rights of prisoners, oppressed people, international racism and wars etc. and that one helped the organisation by buying a candle at Christmas. I was unaware of the rules change within the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">I welcome the involvement of Amnesty. In a short time it has managed to do some things on which it must be complimented. It has attracted major media attention to mental health issues and has brought these issues to the forefront in Ireland. It has also issued seven recommendations to the Government. We hope Amnesty will continue to monitor these recommendations over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">In the past we had an Inspector of Mental Hospitals who was meant to be the champion of patients' rights and was meant to safeguard them. His role meant he should call unannounced to each hospital at least once a year. However, his visit was always well signposted, as I know from experience of working in those hospitals for several years, and it was natural that staff always made sure to put their best foot forward. This may have harmed the situation, and the inspector should have conducted his visits as they were meant to be conducted. Inevitably, after each visit the inspector produced a policy for each hospital. This meant there were 29 or 30 different policies across the country. This did not make sense at all because under his nose in Cavan-Monaghan we had the template for a successful community home-based treatment team that is the envy of countries across Europe. I could never understand why the inspector did not put this template forward as a policy to which each of the hospitals could aspire. Much good work has been done. Our template should be pushed forward. I hope the new inspector of health services will take on board such things and have one policy for the country. It is well known that early detection is the key to successful psychiatric treatment. The only way to ensure that is to invest resources in the community. Research has shown that early treatment means less treatment is required and this, in turn, leads to greater success. If we know that early treatment is the best way, it is strange that it has not been implemented. Financial resources are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Mention has been made of the halving of health service budgets over the years. This is coupled with the fact this issue should be a part of the school curriculum. For transition year, students should learn about and become involved with mental health projects. Adolescents must be targeted and no student should leave secondary school without knowing about the mental health services and how to access them. They should leave school with the knowledge that if they are ever troubled with suicidal thoughts, their lives are worth one telephone call or a plea for help. This should be driven home at school level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Having worked in the service for 29 years, there is much more that I would like to say but I am restricted by the five minutes speaking time I have been offered. However, I am delighted to support Deputy Neville's motion.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_622">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1063">I congratulate Deputy Neville on the significant amount of work he has put into this issue. No-one in this House, including the Minister, can speak with more credibility on this issue, into which the Deputy has put a great amount of time, much of it without thanks. We are here to debate for the first time on a Private Members' motion the state of mental health services. It is a reflection on all of us that over the years we have allowed this issue to slide. There are no votes in it and it has been neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">For this debate, I dug out the last strategic statement on this issue made almost 20 years ago in 1984. There has been nothing but disappointment in the intervening years, if we are honest with ourselves. The high hopes raised in that document of a rapid move to a modern mental health service have not materialised – that is the blunt truth. We have certainly reduced the number of people in in-patient, long-stay psychiatric hospitals – the number has come down from about 12,000 in 1983 to 3,500 to 4,000 at present – but the matching services to balance that reduction in long-stay services have not been developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I can illustrate that point by reference to my own patch, that of the Northern Area Health Board on the north side of Dublin. If the criteria set out in the 1984 report had materialised there would be the following: 270 beds in acute hospitals, including Beaumont and the Mater – there are 37; 400 day centre places for people with mental health problems – there are 135, or less than a third; and as many residential places in the community as long-stay beds – we are 370 short of that equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">A vivid illustration in this regard is the psychiatric unit in Beaumont hospital. In the 1984 document, the psychiatric unit in Beaumont was described as "built". Some 20 years later, it is described as being at the design stage. We have not developed a psychiatric unit in the intervening years. The consequences of this are plain. There are people in inappropriate settings, families struggling to pick up the pieces and vulnerable people falling outside all services and ending up either homeless or in prison – we know from Amnesty International's reports that 40% of homeless people and prisoners have mental health problems, complicating their other needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">On behalf of the Northern Area Health Board, I today read the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals which shows the grim picture that is the reality on Dublin's north side. The Mater Hospital's unit – just 15 beds – is said by the report to be too small to be capable of delivering anything like the service in line with national policy, and it is probably the biggest hospital in the country. Beaumont Hospital, also one of the biggest in the country, has no unit. The report expresses alarm at the lack of clinical psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and physiotherapists linked to any of the services available in the northern area. This means that the opportunity for rehabilitative services is severely curtailed. It deplores the lack of community services which it describes as severely limited and in bad need of refurbishment where they are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The overall picture is one of well-intentioned staff struggling to cope in a service that is not properly integrated. Admission units are badly designed, units are trying to play conflicting roles, Alzheimer's patients are admitted to psychiatric units, those with intellectual disabilities are still in units designated as psychiatric and seclusion is used in that health board area 4.5 times more than the national average because of the lack of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The inspector's report goes further and points up two crucial gaps on the north side of Dublin. First, there is no integrated programme for older people in an area with a severe shortage of nursing homes, psychiatric units and even of ordinary geriatric units to deal with the needs of older people who often end up misplaced in psychiatric units. Second, there is no coherent strategy for dealing with intellectual disability and the report highlights this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Unless we move to a rights-based system – this goes to the core of Deputy Neville's motion – change will never happen. There is no other group of people less able to articulate their needs than those with mental health problems. We must take this on the chin, notwithstanding the reservations of the Department of Finance. We must move to a rights-based system and we should also have a permanent sub-committee of this House which will work with the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to continually and politically highlight these issues. They have been neglected and swept aside and it is time to make a stand. It is a pity the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is not accompanied by his ministerial colleagues who will make the final decisions. This is an important issue raised by a Deputy who is clearly committed to the cause. I hope we will get a decent response from the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_623">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1071">I compliment Deputy Neville for his hard work on this issue, which he continuously highlights on behalf of mental health patients across the country. Listening to some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies in this debate, especially the watchdog, Deputy Grealish, one would swear that plenty of money had been provided for the mental health services. However, when I make a representation on behalf of anyone with a mental health disability, I might as well be beating my head off a brick wall. I hope the Minister takes in what Members on this side of the House have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The Government has totally neglected the mental health services. Fianna Fáil has been in Government for perhaps 15 of the past 20 years but what has it done in regard to mental health? Can the Minister list the measures taken? Deputy Richard Bruton referred to a 1984 report in respect of which no action has been taken. The Government has chosen to ignore the stress, pain and suffering caused by the scandalous lack of resources put into the mental health services. I hope that all Members, across the House, support Deputy Neville and the Fine Gael motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The Amnesty International report on mental health makes for grim reading. It refers to the case of a 22 year old Dublin woman who had to go to the Mater Hospital after trying to commit suicide. She came from a broken family and was defined as homeless, and a home could not be found for her. Despite this, no bed could be found for her in the Mater Hospital or another hospital, a situation which illustrates what is happening to ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">I compliment the great work of voluntary organisations such as the Simon Community and similar organisations. A psychiatric hospital, St. Senan's, is located in my home town of Enniscorthy. Some great work has been carried out there but it is an 18th century building without proper facilities. People over the age of 65 are left there without hope for the future. County Wexford has some fine community houses and this provides an opportunity for some of the psychiatric patients to be brought from the psychiatric hospital into the local community. Patients go to the day care centre during the day and are brought back to the community houses in the evenings. This gives them a chance to mix with ordinary people and get involved in a community, whether by getting involved with a voluntary organisation or going to the local shop or pub. However, this is not happening for many people. There are people in St. Senan's Psychiatric Hospital in Enniscorthy who are over 50 years old and have not seen the outside world, because the Government has totally neglected the care of such people by failing to put community houses in place. Some of the Deputies on this side of the House have already referred to the great community houses in their own constituencies, but a great deal more needs to be done. The Government slogan was "A lot done, more to do", but in this situation nothing has been done and there is a great deal to do. I hope the Minister takes on board everything that has been said tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">In the past, people in mental institutions called them madhouses. I am not ashamed to say that members of my family had to spend time in these institutions, although they are now back to full health. Years ago, one was afraid to say one had a friend or relative in one of these hospitals, but now it has changed and everything is out in the open. One in four people will be affected by mental illness in his or her lifetime. According to the Simon Community and the Amnesty International report, our mental health care is way behind any other country. I hope the Minister takes on board everything that has been said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">Suicide is an issue which causes a great deal of sensitivity among families and is something that no one wants to see visiting their door. Suicide levels in Enniscorthy town and County Wexford have gone out of control. Since October 2002, some ten people have committed suicide by hanging and drowning in Enniscorthy, and yet the Government has cut the budget for suicide prevention by 40% to €655,000. When the Minister of State sums up, will he explain why his Department has cut suicide prevention funding? It is terrible to see the effects of suicide on any family. I would like to see a comprehensive review of mental health care services in order that people get the care they deserve. We should make sure that all our psychiatric hospitals and units are brought up to standard and that we encourage community housing across the country.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_626">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1079">Like other Deputies, I congratulate Deputy Neville on the tireless work he has been doing in the area of mental health and, in particular, suicidal behaviour, since I entered the House four or five years ago, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Consecutive Governments have had a poor record in regard to mental health. The reports which have been referred to by other speakers, including those by Amnesty International, the IPA and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, indicate that the treatment facilities are, in many cases, in poor condition for people who are suffering from mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">I am on the psychiatric services committee of the Southern Health Board and have been exposed to many experiences regarding mental health over the past three to four years. There is a clear policy, with which all Members will agree, of a move away from institutional care towards a community care model. The first half of that objective is well on the way to being achieved, in that we are reducing the number of people in institutional care. The problem is, however, that we are not following through on the second half of that commitment, to fill the vacuum which is produced when people leave institutional care by providing support systems in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The reality is that our community care services for people suffering from mental health problems are unco-ordinated and provided on a piecemeal basis. If we are to make the serious decision to attempt to move people out of institutional care, many of whom have been institutionalised over a long period of time, the Government must ensure that the necessary supports are available within the community and from families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">There are a number of target areas in which we could make significant improvements. It is totally unacceptable that children are queuing for child psychiatry services. Not only are they waiting but, in many cases, they are suffering and their condition is deteriorating while they are on a waiting list. It is one thing waiting for a physical operation, it is quite another to have to wait if one has a mental health condition or requires psychiatric treatment or assessment. This is something the Government needs to target specifically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Many Deputies have mentioned suicide and para-suicide. It is an issue about which there is huge concern in the Southern Health Board region, in particular. An unusually high percentage of the population of Cork and Kerry is affected by suicidal behaviour. Indeed, Kerry has the highest such level in the country. The Government needs to specifically target this area because it has not done so to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">Members of Young Fine Gael are outside the gates of Leinster House this evening trying to highlight the fact that about 50% of homeless people living on the streets, in shelters or in hostels are suffering from mental illness. We need to get more psychiatrists and psychologists into hostels and on to the streets, to help those people to recover from their mental illness problems. That is the only way to get them off the streets.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_627">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1086">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to Fine Gael's Private Members' motion on mental health. I congratulate Deputy Neville for providing us with the opportunity to discuss this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">The mental health service has attracted severe informed and deserved criticism in recent year. To their credit, family members and friends of people with disabilities have become more assertive and critical. It is evident that the political establishment has failed to grasp the nettle of the problems of mental health. Why is that? The answer is that, over the years, the issue was perceived to attract few votes. Expenditure on mental health as a percentage of gross expenditure on the health services has continued to decrease from 13.5% in 1996 to 7.2% in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">Other than meeting the requirements of the Mental Treatment Act 1944, to produce an annual report, what have been the benefits of the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals? It seems to me that it is just another report to be filed away to gather dust. I make this allegation because it seems that, year after year, the same issues are highlighted and recommendations for actions are made, but little progress occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The practice of continued care of patients with intellectual disabilities in long-stay psychiatric facilities is totally inappropriate and, over the years, the inspector has recommended that they be transferred to appropriate accommodation. While acknowledging that some progress has been made, St. Joseph's Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Portrane has been campaigning for years for the provision of two purpose built complexes on the campus. They were first mooted in the mid 1990s and year after year since promises have been made but today not a sod has been turned. Is it any wonder the association found it necessary to bring its case to the European Court?</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">The inspector, in his report, stated that the admissions unit in St. Ita's Hospital is unsuitable for modern acute psychiatric care even though it has been upgraded considerably in recent years. This highlights the delay in constructing the promised acute unit in Beaumont Hospital – more promises, promises, promises. The report referred to serious deficiencies in the provision of appropriate clinical care for patients, the total absence of social workers, psychologists and occupational therapists and stated that physiotherapy was particularly disappointing. The inspector continued that it was inconceivable that a service for almost 300 people with intellectual disabilities in Portrane would not have a psychologist for clinical assessment purposes and no social worker. Today there is no GP either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The role of the staff has been acknowledged in a positive way in the report but, as one who lives in Portrane and who has seen the service provided over the years, if it was not for the commitment and dedication of the staff, the lives of the residents would have no meaning. I hope the Minister takes this on board.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_628">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1092">I welcome the fact that Fine Gael tabled this motion because it raises important issues about the provision of services to persons with mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">As Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, I would like to focus in particular on the provision of psychiatric services for children and adolescents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">There is a growing awareness and concern throughout the country about mental health matters and the National Health Promotion Strategy, 2000-2005, in conjunction with the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, sees mental health as being equally as important as physical health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The promotion of positive mental health can contribute significantly to combating the ignorance and stigma which often surrounds mental illness. Better understanding of mental illness encourages people to access professional help sooner rather than later and this facilitates early recovery. Eventually, with time and education, the stigma associated with mental illness may fade further away, allowing sufferers and their families to participate fully in society in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service has been identified as a priority by my Department. I acknowledge that services for this group still require substantial development. However, we have already come a long way since 1997 when there were few child and adolescent psychiatry services available outside the major cities. Now each health board has a minimum of two consultant-led, multi-disciplinary teams. Additional revenue funding of more than €15 million has been provided by my Department since 1997 for child and adolescent psychiatric services. In 2003, additional funding of €1.64 million will be provided to fund the ongoing expansion of child and adolescent psychiatric services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">A working group was established by my Department in June 2000 to review child and adolescent psychiatry provision and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The group published its first report in March 2001. The report made a number of recommendations on the expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service throughout the country. It also recommended that priority should be given to the recruitment of expertise for the completion of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">In its first report, the working group also examined the issue of in-patient psychiatric services. It recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. At present, four of these child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units are at the planning stage and project teams have been appointed to oversee their development. These units will be built in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">The health strategy includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report and the development and expansion of appropriate mental health services for persons aged between 16 and 18 years. In this regard, the working group has just completed its consideration of the provision of psychiatric services for 16 to 18 year olds. Its report on this important issue was formally presented to the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, yesterday by the group's chairperson, Dr. Paul McCarthy. I join with the Minister of State in welcoming the findings of this latest report, which recommends that priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">The working group is now examining the needs of persons suffering from eating disorders and how appropriate services can be developed in the short, medium and long-term. The group has invited submissions from interested parties on how this problem can be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">As Minister of State with special responsibility for children, it is my intention to ensure that psychiatric services for children and adolescents, both in-patient and community based, will continue to be prioritised in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this important debate and I stress once again this Government's commitment to the ongoing development of services for those suffering from mental illness.</p>

        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_629">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1103">I would like to deal with one aspect of this issue – suicide. Deputy Neville comprehensively covered mental health issues last night and it is with some trepidation that I stand beside the president of the Irish Society of Suicidology, someone who has devoted a great deal of time to raising this matter, as I speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">As Deputy Neville stated last night, in the first half of the 1960s, an average of 64 people died per year by suicide. In the last five years, an average of 456 died each year; last year 451 took their own lives and around 10,000 people attempted to do so. The situation is catastrophic. We in politics must offer hope in society. That hope will only come about if we talk about responsibilities as well as rights. Those of us who can should take responsibility because none of us knows the hour or the day one of our families will need the assistance of which I am speaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The decline in religious practice and spiritual leadership has made a contribution to this state of affairs. I would like to see the churches being kept open. If the new Archbishop of Dublin should do anything, he should set about making sure the churches are kept open because they are places of solace for many people. The church should not be one of fear but of hope, and not just the Catholic Church but churches generally. By promoting hope through religious belief, many people might overcome their despair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">In my constituency, a close friend lost two of his sons to suicide. I know a family where three sons committed suicide and the fourth is suicidal. It is a complicated issue but it is real nonetheless. In raising this issue, I will quote from Patricia Redlich in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 8 June:</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Suicide is an act of despair. We do understand that desperation fuels the self destruction. . . . The circumstances of every suicide are always personal, different, unique to the person involved, and very often heartbroken parents, family and friends search in vain for reasons. . . . Boys are uniquely isolated growing up. It is an almost in-built part of being a teenage male in our society. Kissing and hugging stops at around ten, or 12 if they are terribly lucky – not because parents are careless but because the boys retreat. And thus they are condemned to be without hugs throughout the frightening process of growing up. Nor are there many words for boys are truly terrified of seeming soft or silly to their friends. So they worry and struggle alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Our modern talky-feely society doesn't sit easily with boys either. They are simply less skilled verbally than girls, biologically programmed for action rather than words to put it somewhat provocatively. If they don't feel quite like aliens, they certainly feel seriously one-down, in our world where women seem so at ease. And, no, this is not a nasty side-swipe at feminism. A man's role is now more difficult to define and consists of skills not easily learned while growing up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">I suggest to the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children that they read that article and take on board the whole teaching process in relationships and sexuality where there is a serious problem. So far as the article refers, the issue has to do with young men, not so much young women although it affects them as well. This is a serious issue and Patricia Redlich has touched on a matter about which we as legislators could do something if we set about it. Perhaps the Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for children would meet Patricia Redlich and try to see how our system of education could take on board the concerns she has raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_630">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_1110">The great dawn for improved psychiatric services for persons with mental illness, which I recall was heralded in over 30 years ago in Planning for the Future, was an imaginative step at that time. Unfortunately what was proposed did not materialise to the degree planned. There is no point in saying nothing has happened, as great progress has been made in some areas. I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Neville, for the time and effort he has put into this subject both inside and outside the House. In an assembly such as this we are lucky to have somebody who takes such a great interest in the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">On a night like this we have to evaluate some of the tried and tested programmes which operated in every town and village in Ireland, including my own place in Mountbellew where there are three community houses. We live within the shadow of St. Bridget's Hospital in Ballinasloe. I remember a time when there were 1,200 patients in that hospital but I understand the number is now about 200. We were able to prove that dignity and self-respect could be restored to those who were locked behind high walls for half a generation. I see them walking around in the towns and villages of rural Ireland. They are able to take their place on some of the FÁS schemes and do their shopping with the help of a house parent who looks after what they cannot do themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The most wonderful part of this is that they are totally accepted by the local community. There is no barrier. There have been objections to refugee groups, etc., but never in my 25 years in politics have I witnessed objections to persons with mental handicap. Given that much progress has been made why is it that many of the 4,000 who are still in prison and are well able to look after themselves have not had their dignity and self-respect restored to them? That is the major question for the Minister and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Like my colleagues I receive hundreds of representations from persons, parents and carers of mentally-handicapped children every day. They are highly motivated groups who want rights-based legislation and want to ensure their sons and daughters have the same access to education and medical services as the rest of us. That is what they want and are entitled to. It is also what the people of Ireland want for them. However, it is difficult to know where the Government stands on the issue. It sidesteps the issue every time it is raised here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">There are two sides to this issue. We were able to prove that community-based activities work. Therefore, one is not inventing the wheel in that area. We believe it is a question of resources. For those who cannot be accommodated, and there are many, including the seriously disturbed, surely in this day and age they cannot be in the old mental hospital style atmosphere. Over the past 25 years, every Inspector of Mental Hospitals has said animals should not be put into most of them. Were it not for the consideration of consultants, psychiatric nurses and administrative staff in many of those hospitals the system would have broken down years ago. If we believe in the dignity of human life we know what to do. What is stopping us is that the Minister is not allocating Exchequer funding to the sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_631">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1115">I thank all those who contributed to what was a positive and constructive debate. I should not single out Deputy Grealish but I was disappointed and he was the exception to the tone of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">I pay tribute to the leader of Fine Gael and the Fine Gael Front Bench for taking on board this issue when I submitted it to them and for the encouragement they gave me. Mental health has been described as the Cinderella of the health service and there is no doubt about that. The Minister would accept that. The Minister of State present is not responsible for all that has happened as it has happened over decades. The Minister responsible in this Government has a duty to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Over 15 years the Exchequer contribution to mental health services has fallen from 12% to 7.2% of the health budget. That is a halving of the health budget which mental health services had 15 years ago. One may speak about advocates but nobody here is parading about mental health because of the stigma surrounding it and people do not want to speak about it. In some ways they are afraid to visit the subject. We must realise that of the 4 million people in the State, 1 million will suffer from a psychiatric condition at some stage in their lives, needing intervention. Sometimes they do not obtain the intervention for some of the reasons mentioned and sometimes they do not recognise the need for intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">In many of the cases to which Deputy Gay Mitchell referred, young people do not recognise that they suffer from depression. They feel it is despair, they are under pressure but they do not recognise it is depression, needing treatment. The Minister spoke about advocacy and I welcome that. It is important because I know of a real situation in the psychiatric unit of a general hospital where if a patient asks for a second opinion he or she is transferred out of that service to the long-stay hospital where there are no psychological or counselling services. He or she is almost punished. The reason given is that the patient was difficult, displayed unmanageable conduct and was unreasonable because of the request for a second opinion. The advocacy issue is very important. Amnesty International has raised eight issues, each one of which deserves a Private Members' debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">In the area of psychiatry there are brilliant psychiatrists but there are also bad psychiatrists. The whole area of how the psychiatric service is delivered must be examined. Everybody is afraid to question a psychiatrist. They feel they have knowledge that is incomprehensible to most of us. There is a problem with the delivery of psychiatry in Ireland that should be examined. I have a great deal of contact with brilliant psychiatrists through my role as president of the Irish Association of Suicidology. They are on my board. Our chairman, our secretary and our outgoing chairman were, respectively, two professors of psychiatry and a consultant psychiatrist. They are excellent people as is Professor Malone, who also sits on our board. People who do not sit on our board such as Professor Patricia Casey and Dr. Anthony Clare are also brilliant people. There is a problem and it should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">It is worth quoting Dr. Anthony Clare's point that the mentally ill are now the most systematically stigmatised group in our society. They are the true lepers of today. That point reflects fully the state of affairs. The stigma attached to mental illness must be addressed and it is the responsibility of the Government to play a large part in that. We must get people to understand, involve themselves, avail of and demand full and proper psychiatric services of the Government. Unfortunately, until the people demand it, the Government will not react.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The Minister referred to the suicide research group. To correct the record, I do not think there is such a group as there is a lack of research carried out in this country. There is a suicide review group which simply reviews what is happening. Perhaps we will discuss that in the future. The review group is a cover for the Government doing nothing.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Job Losses.</heading>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_632">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1128">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter, the closure of Fitzpack Ballindine Limited, on the Adjournment. The loss of jobs to the Ballindine area is equivalent to the loss of 150 jobs to a place like Galway or Limerick. If the company is to close, a replacement industry must be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Ballindine is trying hard to succeed. It is a small rural village with a population of approximately 300 people. The population has increased in the recent past and the number of pupils in the local school has also increased. It is a five teacher school. The increasing population in the past ten to 15 years led to talk that the school might become a six teacher school but that will not happen now unless steps are taken to help the area. This is a vibrant community with new housing estates but it is now under threat. That is regrettable. I urge the Government to do something to prevent these job losses or, if the jobs are lost, to secure a replacement industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Is it time to stop grant aid being paid to Dublin? We have received the recent report from the IDA. The CSO is ringing alarm bells about what is happening in Dublin. Traffic moves at the pace of an ass and cart. However, half the graduates from the west have to go to Dublin to get their first job. What is happening in Ballindine is bad news. The IDA has not been helpful in Mayo. Recently it failed to secure an industry for the town of Ballinrobe because it would not provide the support the industry believed was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">According to the IDA report, there were only seven IDA projects outside Dublin or Cork last year. Ballindine has Objective One status but what good is that when it cannot get industry to locate there? What good are the higher grants when there is no industry to get those grants? Total employment in IDA-supported jobs fell by 10% in the BMW area whereas, in the east, it increased by 0.4%. This is extremely worrying. Nobody knows what will happen in 2006 but there will be severe restrictions on grant aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The developments in Ballindine and Ballinrobe are worrying but the IDA seems to be impotent, especially in view of its last report. Is the game up for the west of Ireland? The north-west of Mayo is the most deprived area in the country. The IDA has been paying €120,000 per year for a vacant factory in Ballinrobe for the past 15 to 20 years. There are another 15 years to run on the lease, which means an expenditure of €1.8 million. Where is the balanced development if the jobs in Ballindine are allowed to go and no replacement industry is found? Where is the national spatial strategy in all of this? Where does north Mayo fit in? I ask the Government to address the Ballindine situation, which is a good example of what is happening in this area of the west.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_633">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1133">I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this matter on the Adjournment. It has also been raised with me by Deputy John Carty, and Deputy Ring mentioned it earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The company in question has two plants in County Mayo, which employed a total of 32 people, including nine in Ballindine. The company only confirmed today that the Ballindine facility closed on 6 June 2003, with the loss of seven of these jobs, and that the remaining two jobs were transferred to Ballyhaunis. The company's reasons for the closure were a downturn in business, a major increase in overhead costs and competition from imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">Competition from abroad has been increasing for the company's products with packaging products being supplied up to 30% cheaper. Last year, Enterprise Ireland held discussions with the company to assist in addressing competitiveness issues and Enterprise Ireland's supplier development programme is available to the company. This programme is designed to help companies to get accreditation and support up to a value of €10,000 for consultancy, project management and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">New Enterprise Ireland funding arrangements recently announced by the Tánaiste have been introduced to tackle directly the issues facing client firms in their drive for competitiveness and export business. Applications to Enterprise Ireland for funding support from its client companies must include exports as part of the company's business strategy. Unfortunately, in this case, the company was trading on the home market only. There is also now more emphasis on funding for research and development and training with increased support ceilings under the RTI scheme and a new €10 million fund for SMEs to help build international competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Enterprise Ireland's non-financial support to its existing client companies includes developing export sales, that is, seeking to identify real sales prospects in overseas markets for clients which is done by researching prospects and introducing clients and potential key buyers; and providing technology advice and access to knowledge and expertise in identifying new product/process opportunities in the research institutes in Ireland or through partners in Ireland and/or overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">In the event of job losses in firms, FÁS can meet with staff and offer advice and guidance to those seeking alternative employment or training. I understand that in this case FÁS has already made arrangements to meet with the employees to bring its services to their assistance. These will include intensive interviews, individually and/or in groups, with affected workers which will outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral by FÁS of redundant workers to jobs, training courses or other options; establishment of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">As regards job creation, recent IDA Ireland job announcements for the Mayo area include Fort Wayne Metals in Castlebar, DeCare in Claremorris and Crossmolina and AMO in Westport. Indeed, Fort Wayne Metals is the first tenant in the new 17 acre business and technology park in Castlebar. Other business parks have been developed in Ballina and Westport. Enterprise Ireland has also provided support to nearby Claremorris under its community enterprise programme in 2000 for an enterprise centre. This is now complete and the first tenants are in occupation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The full resources of the development agencies, including the county enterprise board, are available to assist. The CEB is available to assist any employees who may have ideas for establishing their own businesses. I am confident therefore that a focused agency approach, together with a local based approach, will be successful in addressing jobs in the area.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1142">Tá mé an-bhuíoch don Cheann Chomhairle as ucht an seans a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar seo a ardú. Tá sé ag goilleadh go géar ar phaisinéirí agus ar na comhlachtaí atá ag déanamh iarracht cúrsaí farántóireachta a chur ar fáil do na hoileáin i mo dháilcheantar i nGaillimh Thiar, sin é Oileáin Arann. Tá dola ann don chéad uair ar na cúrsaí farántóireachta as Castletownbere fosta. An rud atá tábhachtach domsa ná an chaoi ina bhfuil na dolaí nua seo á leagan gan cainteanna agus gan a bheith cinnte cén tionchair agus éifeacht a bheidh acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">I am very grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue. From 1 July 2003 the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, proposes to invoke the powers he has under section 4(2) of the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts 1968 and 1980. There are other relevant Acts which deal simply with the transfer of functions to the Minister and his new Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">If one thinks of the dates of the basic Act and the amending Act, 1968 and 1980, to rather suddenly announce, after 23 years, that there are going to be charges, passenger levy included, on people travelling to the Aran Islands is potentially absolutely disastrous in its effects. There are a number of charges with which I have no difficulty in relation to the appropriate management of a port. The one I particularly want to emphasise, however, is charge No. 10, which arises in the Minister's list of charges as 10a – use of harbour by passenger or cruise vessels with a permitted compliment of 100 passengers or more – and 10b – use of harbours by passenger vessels with a permitted complement of 13 to 99 passengers. The levy is €1.20 per passenger per departure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">It is quite extraordinary that no opportunity was made to consult with those who regularly use the passenger service for a very short journey from Rossaveal to the Aran Islands. I am sticking with the Aran Islands as an example. Take the example of students, many of whom come to Galway to study and travel home to the Aran Islands. Although some of the heritage aspects of the Aran Islands are under severe pressure from coastal erosion, one must remember that the islands are used as an educational resource by people who bring groups of maybe 40 or 50 students. The idea of a €1.20 levy on such students, children or even islanders themselves, who are not exempt in this order, is an attempt to introduce charges by stealth without consultation with those who are most effected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">Different companies providing the service, including one that I looked at in detail and which has no difficulty in supplying its accounts to the Minister, are facing an enormous decline in their revenues this year. Competition between ferry companies is very keen. Companies have to give groups of students or groups of people studying painting, botany or going to courses on the Aran Islands a competitive group rate. If the companies give a group rate to such groups visiting the islands for educational, cultural and heritage purposes, they have no exemption here. The €1.20 levy falls on each individual participant who is travelling. To introduce the levy without consultation is very silly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">Due to the international respect accorded to John Millington Synge and others and to films such as "The Man of Aran," a great number of the people travelling to the Aran Islands are from the United States. There has been a very serious decline in tourism from the United States – that revenue is gone. When I looked at the accounts for the full year of one of the ferry companies, I could see that a very serious loss is being incurred at present. It is possibly the very worst time to be introducing a levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">In order to be balanced and fair, and in respect to the Ceann Comhairle's generosity in allowing me to raise this matter, which is also being raised by another Deputy, there are, altogether, across six headings, a whole list of charges, some dealing with the proper management of the provision of water cleaning, the use of the port or whatever, with which I have no difficulty. However, I urge the Minister of State to indicate that he is willing to reconsider the charges, especially with regard to charge No. 10.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_1151">Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar seo. Tá ar muintir Oileáin Árainn €1.20 breise a íoc gach turas. I am sorry the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is not present. I strongly protest that he can, by ministerial directive, impose a charge on passengers travelling from Rossaveal to the Aran Islands. The last year for which figures are available is 2000, when 150,000 passengers travelled from Rossaveal to the Aran Islands. If the charge had been imposed on them it would have generated an income of approximately €180,000. Prior to this, the boats involved paid an annual charge of €8,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">It is clear that this measure is a means of generating finance and taxing the hard-pressed taxpayers in the Galway area who use the ferry between Rossaveal and the Aran Islands. It is also a tax on the tourism industry because many of the passengers using the service are tourists. It effectively amounts to a tax of €1.20 per tourist and will act as a great disincentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Most passengers travel to the Aran Islands from Rossaveal rather than Galway because of the shorter journey. In 2000, only 5,000 passengers used the Galway service. One of the boat owners providing this service, Inishmore Ferries, is doing so without any subsidy while the other boat owners are heavily subsidised by the State. For example, Island Ferries had a contract for €603,000 and it received an extra once-off payment of €127,000 after signing the contract plus an additional €95,000 per year. Will it and other subsidised operates receive an increase in their subsidy?</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">Inishmore Ferries had agreed to bring Special Olympics visitors on a trip to the Aran Islands. Is the Minister to impose a €1.20 charge on those passengers? How can services operate in such circumstances? I ask the Minister to reconsider this measure and bring it before the Dáil rather than sneaking it in as a ministerial directive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_639">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_1155">I approach this issue from a different angle. It affects Killybegs not in the context of ferry operators, but because of the negative impact it will have on the fishing industry. The Minister of State is aware of the crisis in the fishing industry. A number of years ago, between 1,500 and 2,000 people were employed in the fishing industry in Killybegs but current numbers are only one third of that. This measure will have a negative impact on the industry, the economy of Killybegs and south-west Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">This measure was a bolt out of the blue. It amounts to another stealth tax. The Minister's predecessor established a committee to assess the impact of transferring responsibility for the major fishing ports from the Department to the local committees. However, rather than waiting for the committee's views or report, he announced this tax. The entire fishing community from Donegal to Castletownbere is up in arms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister to reconsider this measure. It is a draconian levy and a penal tax and it could not have been imposed at a worse time. If it is implemented it will drive people out of fishing. They are existing on a knife edge at present and this will be the final nail in the coffin. In view of this I ask the Minister of State to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this drastic measure before irreparable harm is done to small fishing communities along the western seaboard, where unemployment is rampant and where fishing is often the only viable livelihood available to many communities.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_640">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_1158">I thank Deputies Michael D. Higgins, McCormack and McGinley for raising this issue. I apologise for the absence of the Minister. He asked me to extend his regrets for not being in the Chamber but he is in Luxembourg to attend tomorrow's meeting of the European Fisheries Council on the question of the Irish Box.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">The charges at the five fishery harbours located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveal and Killybegs were last increased in 1990 and are clearly in need of upward revision. The operation and management of these harbours are provided for in the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts 1968 to 1998. The harbours are owned and managed directly by my Department and the employees at the centres are Department employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">The operation and management are administered by way of the fishery harbour centres fund, which is provided for in section 9 of the 1968 Act. All income received by way of harbour dues, rents, etc., is paid into the fund and outlays in respect of the management of the harbours are also paid out of the fund. The 2002 draft accounts for the fund show an operating deficit of €544,990 and an aggregate deficit of €1.2 million. Without a significant increase in income, the deficit will increase rapidly as staff and other operating costs, such as the costs of maintaining the facility, electricity, telephone and waste disposal, increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">The Exchequer meets the total capital costs of developing the five fishery harbour centres through the national fishery harbour development programme and is providing €28 million in 2003 for those purposes. Proposed new charges at the fishery harbour centres were published on 21 May 2003, with the statutory consultation period of 21 days provided for until midnight on 10 June. Included in these proposals are a proposed flat rate charge of €1.20 per passenger per departure from any fishery harbour centre by vessels permitted to carry 100 passengers or more, instead of the current flat rate charge of £4,000 imposed in 1990. Increased charges are also proposed for smaller passenger vessels. The proposed charges set out in draft order are designed to reflect costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">A number of detailed submissions were made regarding the proposed increased charges for passenger vessels. The Minister will need time to consider them carefully and the outcome of the public consultation process before making his decision regarding charges at fishery harbour centres. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this aspect on his behalf at this time. However, I assure the Deputies I will communicate their views to the Minister, particularly regarding some of the issues dealing with charges for teenagers and children and group charges.</p>

        <heading>Shannon Airport.</heading>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_641">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1163">Shannon is not just an airport. The independent overseas consultant, Alastair Tucker, concluded in his 1997 study that 23,000 direct jobs, mainly in industry, and 13,000 indirect jobs depend on Shannon Airport. Recent updates put that figure at over 40,000 jobs. European and international studies consistently highlight the Shannon region as a prime example of regional development. They all conclude that the key driver of this regional development and economic success is the airport and in particular its high level of services from the United States. The EU has consistently supported regions and has put considerable financial resources into delivering on its commitment to peripheral areas. I am confident that the Commission will acknowledge and accommodate the special case of the west of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">The onus is on the Minister and the Government to make a powerful case and not to undermine it in advance by negotiating a weaker position with the US authorities. Since 1994 – this is not generally well known – airlines have had the option of operating directly on US routes to and from either Dublin or Shannon as long as half the transatlantic flights serve Shannon. Aer Lingus, through a combination of inept management, uneven marketing, and anti-rural bias has failed to capitalise on this opportunity. If the will was there very few flights would need to land at both airports as they would be filled from both. Aer Lingus management and some of its American counterparts want to serve only one Irish destination and they have perversely discommoded business and private customers in Dublin and the west by routing flights through both airports to further that aim. People taking flights in Dublin are frequently put through Shannon. Likewise, people travelling from Shannon are very frequently being backtracked through Dublin in both directions. Prior to 1994 Aer Lingus promised that direct flights from Dublin would reduce the numbers going over London. The direct opposite has happened, which will not come as any surprise to anyone who has dealt with the airline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The Government will have to decide if, as shareholder, it is solely concerned with the value of an asset to be shed at the highest price. It will have to decide whether the terms regional, or employment opportunities in the regions, mean anything or whether they should be sacrificed for the paltry return on the privatisation of Aer Lingus. In response to a parliamentary question yesterday the carrot of transatlantic services was held out to other airports besides Dublin and Shannon. I am surprised that the senior official who prepared the response was not aware that Aer Lingus objected strongly to the provision of facilities for wide-bodied aircraft in the new Cork Airport facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">More than 40% of traffic through Shannon in 2002 comprised transatlantic flights. Shannon's daily direct flights are the lifeblood of industries up and down the west coast. They ensure that spare parts and raw materials are readily available and that deliveries of air freight reach customers on time. A diminution of services will result in job losses. Last week the promoters of the western technology corridor project, comprising key west of Ireland industrialists, reacted with horror to the news of open skies without a well-researched and adequately funded alternative strategy. Dr. Ed Walsh put the start-up cost of his Atlantic technopolis, the Cork-Limerick-Galway axis as a counterweight to Dublin, at €1 billion. His proposals put flesh on the bones of the national spatial strategy. This debate on air access policy is the first test and so far the Government seems destined for a no-grade result on the issue. More than 80% of air access is via Dublin and 90% of surface access is through east coast ports. The recent interim report of a tourism policy review group called for that share to be increased. When I asked the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to publish the background and supporting documentation he could not. There is none of course, except that conjured up by Aer Lingus executives and their business allies salivating at the prospect of a windfall, similar to that which followed the privatisation of Telecom, in the privatisation stakes of our national airline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">Changes will occur in aviation policy. I want those changes to be planned and managed to the benefit of the entire country. Dublin needs to have its growth managed just as much as the west needs a share of national growth in industrial and economic advances. Some regional support can be provided by regulation. Other supports cost money. The most dramatic and beneficial results have been seen in the case of Shannon and its hinterland. If the Government had many millions of euro at its disposal the same result could be achieved by direct investment in infrastructure and services. There is, however, a very considerable saving to the national exchequer by pursuing the former route of some regulation with some investment, and the EU will go along with the Government case if it is strongly made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">The White Paper on Transport of 2002, prepared by the committee of the regions, concluded that regional airports should not be disadvantaged by proposals for any joint transatlantic aviation agreement. I strongly agree with that sentiment. The Government has a wonderful opportunity to deliver on regional development and a spatial strategy while ensuring that the conditions for growth in air traffic and tourism are also availed of.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_642">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1169">I thank Deputy Tony Killeen for tabling this matter. He has been a consistent champion of Shannon Airport and the hinterland since his election here, and long before. Inside and outside this House, he has consistently supported demands for a better future for Shannon Airport and the regions. I compliment and support him on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">I will begin by outlining for the House the background before moving on to the issues that I took into consideration in relation to this matter, the decision taken in Luxembourg on 5 June, and where I see the future of transatlantic aviation, its implications for Shannon Airport and for Ireland as a whole. The European Court of Justice ruled, on 5 November 2002, on a case taken by the European Commission against eight member states, not including Ireland, concerning their "open skies" agreements with the US, that the designation of national airlines in their bilateral air transport agreements is contrary to the right of establishment provided for under the treaties establishing the European Union. This means that member states must allow any European airline established in their countries to enjoy the benefits of that member state's bilateral agreements. This legal principle applies to each member state's bilaterals with every third country, not just with the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">In response to the court's ruling, the Commission then reactivated a proposal to give it a mandate to negotiate an open aviation area agreement with the US. This was a long-standing proposal, and I believe that it is only a matter of time before such a mandate will be given to the Commission. The EU and US territories would be treated as one single aviation area. Such an OAA agreement between the EU and US would satisfactorily solve the legal problems highlighted by the court in relation to the US, and is a pragmatic response to the difficulty of up to 15, and shortly 25, member states having to simultaneously change their agreements with the US in an integrated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">The mandate put forward by the Commission envisages a liberalised regime in which airlines may be owned, in any proportion, by European or US persons or interests, and such airlines may operate services in both Europe and the US, as well as between them. The intention is that these airlines could operate from any point to any other point in the open aviation area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">Other issues also arose during discussion on that mandate, such as the implications that an EU-US agreement would have for relations with third countries other than the US, and whether member states could continue to negotiate changes to their agreements with third countries on a bilateral basis, and these were all taken into account when the Transport Council took its decision on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">These issues were discussed at Transport Councils in December 2002 and March 2003, but came up for decision at the Council held on 5 June in Luxembourg. It was not expected to be decided upon until the October meeting but the Commission and Presidency accelerated matters. When deciding what position I should adopt at that Council on behalf of Ireland, the main issues that I took into account were the ruling of the European Court of Justice last November, the impact on Shannon Airport and its hinterland, the impact on tourism of increased access to Ireland, the opportunities for Aer Lingus to increase its business on transatlantic routes, as well as Ireland's wider relationship with Europe. I should make it clear that my Department has not yet engaged in any negotiations with the US authorities regarding Ireland's current air transport agreement. While prior to the council meeting there were discussions between officials in my Department and officials from the US Embassy, at the embassy's request, regarding aviation issues generally, including the issues surrounding the European Court's ruling, those discussions did not include any negotiations regarding the bilateral agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">The existing Government policy on Shannon Airport has been in place in order to assist the development of that airport, as well as regional development in the west. It is recognised that for Ireland to have a globally competitive but regionally integrated economy, effective connections to the world are vital. Shannon Airport is strategically located and close to a significant population base. While recognising the transatlantic role of Shannon, its strategic location also suggests an enhanced role for it in linking the growing population bases in those areas with the UK and mainland Europe in addition to the US and eastern Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">A major factor regarding Shannon is that an EU-US liberalised market is the inevitable outcome of this whole process in Europe. It became very clear that there was a consensus among other member states that an EU-US agreement was the way forward. In view of that reality, I took the view that to seek to insist on a non-open skies policy would damage not only Irish tourism, business and aviation as a whole, but also the potential for Shannon Airport to carve out new routes into the US in this new and liberalised market, and to develop itself as a hub for passengers and cargo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">At the Transport Council, I stated that I would not oppose the wish of all the other member states to grant this mandate to the Commission to negotiate an EU-US agreement. I also reiterated my concerns about the impact an agreement might have on Shannon Airport, and I pointed out strongly that I will carefully assess the draft agreement which ultimately emerges from those negotiations. The decision to grant this mandate to the Commission was unanimous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">While I am conscious of the concerns being expressed on behalf of Shannon, I believe that a liberalised EU-US aviation market will have significant potential benefits not only for Irish tourism and business, but also for Shannon itself, for Irish citizens wishing to travel to the US, for Aer Lingus which could open new routes to the US and for other Irish airports which currently do not have scheduled services to destinations in the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">I reiterate my commitment that I will not agree to any changes until I am fully satisfied that Shannon has an equal or greater volume of aviation business available to it. We will use the breathing space to engage in consultation with Shannon, with airlines and other interests to bring this about.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1186">As I have previously advised the House, I opposed the fishing effort limitation scheme agreed at last December's Council on the basis that the application of days-at-sea restrictions was not the appropriate mechanism for the recovery of cod stocks and would severely impact on the economies of coastal fishing communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">I am, therefore, keenly aware of the difficulties arising from the current restrictions and I have held discussions with the fishing industry on how best to develop a viable alternative. The industry and I have agreed that a pre-requisite to the development of a viable alternative cod recovery strategy is the collection of additional scientific data on the state of the cod stock off the Donegal coast. In this regard, the Marine Institute is currently engaged in a study costing more than €300,000 into cod stocks off the coast of Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">This project, which is being undertaken in co-operation with the Donegal fishing industry, will increase our knowledge of that cod stock and will enable more appropriate and specific technical conservation measures to be devised. I will seek to have such targeted measures incorporated into a long-term recovery plan for that cod stock with a view to replacing the blunt instrument of the days-at-sea approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">The Commission has recently presented a new long-term plan for the recovery of cod stocks off the north-west coast and elsewhere, including the Irish Sea. The new proposals, which again provide for days-at-sea restrictions, will be considered in detail in the coming months. I am also conscious of the need to identify and encourage diversification options for fishermen most affected by the current restrictions. In that context a range of projects involving a total investment of more than €770,000 have just been approved.</p>

          <p eId="para_1201">The programme for Government contains a commitment to work to increase forest planting levels to 20,000 hectares annually. Under the terms of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government has confirmed its commitment to the development of the forestry sector in a manner that maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis. The partnership agreement contains a commitment to promote and support increased planting levels up to 20,000 hectares per annum. The agreement acknowledges that this commitment is subject to available budgetary resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">The 2004 allocation for forestry will be determined through the annual Estimates process and will be made known later this year. The Deputies will be aware that the Government is facing very difficult choices in the areas of public finances and may not be in a position to make as much money available for all programmes as it would wish.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_75">I am very conscious of the serious concerns among forestry stakeholders in relation to the current budgetary position. In this regard, there have been extensive consultations with the sector following which the primary focus of funding for this year has been targeted towards a viable planting programme. As a result of these consultations, planting levels in 2003 are expected to reach 12,000 hectares.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">I reassure the Deputy that the Government is strongly committed to the development of the forestry sector. This commitment is underlined by the provisions of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which clearly demonstrate that the Government recognises the important role which forestry plays and will continue to play in the development of rural and local economies. As part of these commitments I have directed that a fundamental review of the strategic policy for forestry, Growing for the Future, which was published in 1996, be undertaken this year. This review will reflect the significant changes in the sector and society as a whole since 1996 and will involve wide stakeholder consultation.</summary>

However, all stakeholders recognise that the network must adapt to its customer needs and the financial viability of the service secured if the network is to survive and develop. In order to meet these objectives, the Government has increased the share capital of An Post by €12.7 million to facilitate the implementation of reforms. An Post has secured additional business for the network, including bill pay facilities for the ESB, mobile phone top-ups through their Postpoint service and a contract with AIB under which the banks' customers can access their accounts through the network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Parallel with these developments, under an agreement between the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post, the conversion of sub-post offices from a fixed contract to an agency basis, whereby payments are linked to transactions, is being implemented on a voluntary basis. Where vacancies arise in the normal course of events, An Post advertises the post at least twice and actively canvasses for suitable persons to fill the vacant positions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants that a post office is closed. Such closures are regarded as temporary pending an application from a suitable person. Since taking office, I have met with senior management of the company and have been briefed on key issues, including the future of the post office network, by An Post.</p>

          <p eId="para_1211">The electricity systems North and South are linked by interconnectors at three points between Tandragee and Louth, Strabane and Letterkenny and Enniskillen and Corraclassy. Following the upgrading that took place during 2001 at the behest of my predecessor and Sir Reg Empey, the main North-South interconnector between Tandragee and Louth now has a capacity to operate 2 x 600 megawatts, MW, of power, which is enough electricity to power several major towns. It previously had half that capacity. The ability to use this capacity to the full in a South-North direction is severely curtailed by grid congestion between Dublin and the Border. The two regulators are, however, optimising what can be achieved. The deficiency will be cured in the context of the ongoing five year grid development programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">The other two interconnectors were commissioned in 1994 as standby links, primarily to allow the two grid companies to provide mutual assistance in an emergency. Since 2001 they have also been upgraded to full system interconnectors with a capacity to operate at 120 MW each. The upgrading is in line with one of the main recommendations of the 2001 study by IPA Consultants into options for the development of an all-island energy market. The question of increasing capacity on the interconnectors or possibly building a new interconnector forms part of the recently re-launched dialogue between both Administrations on the creation of an all-island energy market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I expect to meet Mr. Ian Pearson, who currently has responsibility for the energy portfolio in Northern Ireland, in early July with a view to jointly endorsing a specific and time-bound work programme aimed at progressing this important issue.</p>

       the way in which Ireland compares to its EU neighbours in relation to broadband roll-out and e-readiness.

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_654">

          <p eId="para_1219">The latest available European Commission figures indicate that Ireland currently stands in seventh place in the EU in terms of Internet penetration rate. This places us ahead of the EU average. In comparison to other OECD countries, Ireland remains at the lower end of the league table in terms of broadband penetration. However, there have recently been a number of significant developments which should lead to a greater take up of the Internet and broadband services and is likely to improve Ireland's international ranking. In addition, Ireland has performed strongly according to a number of other information society benchmarks, particularly in the usage of wireless technologies, which will become increasingly important in the broadband area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">A number of communications companies offering DSL services have recently announced major reductions in the prices of their broadband services bringing the cost of DSL in line with the European norm. This is likely to further assist broadband penetration. In accordance with the provisions of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, on 21 February last I issued a set of policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation focusing on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat-rate Internet access call origination, known as FRIACO. This will be introduced before the end of June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">Although in our liberalised telecommunications market, it is primarily a matter for the private sector operators to invest in the appropriate infrastructure and services, my Department has a role in addressing priority areas where the private sector alone will not deliver the necessary infrastructure within the timescale necessary to critical national objectives. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision has been made for significant investment in broadband infrastructure. The funding is being used and will be used by my Department to run programmes of targeted intervention to accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services by the private sector throughout the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_78">The current call for proposals focuses on the provision of open access to broadband infrastructure, constructed in 19 towns around the country. The regional broadband programme involves an investment by my Department of over €65 million and it is expected that all networks will be fully complete and operational by July 2004. The issue of Ireland's e-readiness is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, who is responsible for the information society. However, the development of our underlying telecommunications infrastructure, in the form of the initiatives previously outlined, is widely recognised as an area of critical importance to our e-readiness. In terms of our overall e-readiness, Ireland has consistently performed strongly in the e-Europe benchmarking process. In fact, Ireland has performed strongest of all EU member states in the area of e-Government since November 2001.</summary>

Initial results from the exploration well have been encouraging. The well penetrated a substantial column of hydrocarbons. In October 2002, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, said that before the size of the accumulation or the possibility of any commercial development can be assessed, a considerable amount of analysis of existing data together with much further appraisal work on the prospect will be required. Drilling operations, which had to be suspended last October due to poor weather conditions, commenced again in May with the re-entry of the Dooish well. Operations on the well are ongoing and the results have to be analysed before any further assessment can be made of the likely significance of the discovery.

          <p eId="para_1227">As I stated in reply to a similar question on 29 January, 4 March and 15 April last, there is justification for optimism in 2003 about petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore. Much of the Atlantic margin of our offshore is either untested or under-explored and every effort is being made to promote the exploration of these areas. These efforts face considerable obstacles. Unfortunately, the past 12 months have seen a steep decline in exploration activity in north west Europe. In Ireland, there are now only seven offshore exploration licences in place, which is down from a peak of 32 just five years ago. In addition, western offshore areas are difficult to access and explore in terms of water depth, distance from land and lack of infrastructure. These define both the difficulties and the challenge faced by both the Government and the industry.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_80">Last November, my colleague in the Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, launched the Porcupine Licensing Initiative. Its purpose is to re-open the Porcupine region, closed since 1999, for exploration. The region will be opened for licensing in four tranches as it covers a large area, 241 full blocks in total. There have been some wells drilled there in the past, but it still has real exploration potential. Regrettably, there were no applications in relation to the first tranche, which had a closing date of 15 March 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">The results from the Dooish well that was drilled off Donegal last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland also gives grounds for optimism. The company will carry out further appraisal of the well this year. My Department has long held that there was real exploration potential within these frontier areas and these results further vindicate this view. A further exploration well will be drilled by Statoil in the Slyne/Erris Basin in 2003 under a licence commitment.</summary>

Development of the Seven Heads Gas Field is under way and production is set to commence later this year. A small satellite development, South-West Kinsale Greensand, in the Kinsale Gas Field, is directed at accessing gas reserves that were not being drained effectively by the existing Kinsale Gas Field wells. The target date for gas production is July 2003. Six development wells, one exploration well, one appraisal well and one production well will be drilled throughout 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1229">The monitoring of activities in waters within Ireland's exclusive economic zone, including the Irish Box, is undertaken by the Irish Naval Service and the Irish Air Corps, agencies of the Department of Defence. My Department is kept informed routinely as to the trends and levels of activities detected in these waters. Particular attention has been paid to vessel activities within the Irish Box as this area has been the subject of particular fisheries measures. The Irish authorities are, therefore, continuing to monitor activity within the Irish Box closely. In relation to the specific restriction on the number of Spanish vessels permitted within the Irish Box at one time, the number has remained below the 40 vessels threshold in the relevant EU regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">In so far as the May Fisheries Council is concerned, our position is that the latest proposals discussed at that Council fall short of what is required. Our primary focus is to ensure that fish stocks around our coast receive the necessary level of protection. The new proposals have, however, moved significantly from the position adopted by the Commission last December, which effectively abolished the Irish Box. Accordingly, our campaign over recent months for retention of the Irish Box against outright opposition from the Commission has made some progress. The latest proposals, while they do not in our view go far enough, recognise the need to retain certain restrictions on fishing. This issue is due to be discussed again at the Fisheries Council on 12 June. We will in that context emphasise and reinforce the primary consideration which is that stocks in this biologically sensitive area must be conserved.</p>

These two factors underpin Ireland's view that these waters require special protection and conservation measures. In our extensive discussions with both the Greek Presidency and with Commissioner Fischler on the issue of the Irish Box in recent months, we have consistently emphasised the biological sensitivity of fishing grounds around Ireland.

Many significant changes have come about both in the forestry sector and in the economy in general over this period. I have directed that a review of the plan be undertaken this year. A commitment to do this is contained in the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. The review will involve wide stakeholder consultation and the revised plan will provide a framework to enable the forestry sector to realise its full potential and contribute to our economic and social well-being. The review of the national climate change strategy, together with the mid-term reviews of the CAP rural development plan and various operational programmes under the national development plan which are currently under way, will also inform the review of the sector.</p>

The Commission's long-term proposals for cod recovery, which were published in May, cover cod in the Irish Sea.

          <p eId="para_1245">The Commission proposed an effort regime for Irish Sea cod in the proposals brought forward in December 2001. During the protracted and difficult discussions leading to the adoption of a days-at-sea regime for some cod stocks in December 2002, I successfully argued for the exclusion of the Irish Sea cod stock from any effort regime. This was on the basis that a recovery plan based on closed areas to protect the cod spawning stock and other technical measures was in place and was working. This approach had been developed following detailed consultation with industry representatives. It is an effective regime that will deliver stock recovery in the medium term.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_89">My position has not changed. I remain convinced that the recovery plan currently in place will ensure the recovery of the Irish Sea cod stock. I do not consider that an effort regime, as proposed by the Commission, is the appropriate approach for this stock. I will continue to put forward a strong case for a continuation of the current recovery plan, based on closed areas and technical measures. It is clear that we face a hard battle. The Commission is committed to having effort regimes included in all recovery plans. I will continue to work closely with industry to make the strongest possible case for a recovery plan that both ensures the recovery of the stock and protects the livelihood of fishermen dependent on Irish Sea fisheries.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1252">As I stated in reply to a similar question on 15 April last, Ireland already has sovereign exploration and exploitation rights over its exclusive economic zone, EEZ, the area of Continental Shelf up to 200 nautical miles from its baselines. Ireland claims an extended Continental Shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and up to more than 500 nautical miles, particularly in the Hatton-Rockall area. As Ireland is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, it is required to make a submission on its extended Continental Shelf claim to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, CLCS. The Irish claim is supported by data that Ireland has collected and interpreted and which will be included in its submission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">The Hatton-Rockall extended Continental Shelf area is also claimed by Iceland and the Faroe Islands, Denmark. Since the CLCS has no mandate regarding issues of delimitation between neighbouring states and cannot consider an area under dispute without the agreement of all the parties concerned, Ireland has been participating in informal discussions with Iceland and the Faroes in an attempt to resolve the dispute before making its submission to the CLCS. The outer limit approved by the CLCS will be the outer limit of Ireland's Continental Shelf exploration rights. Ireland is working to make its submission to the CLCS by 2006.</p>

          <p eId="para_1264">In August 2002, following the <i>Pisces</i> tragedy, I initiated a review of safety on small watercraft focusing on the requirement to carry and wear lifejackets, licensing requirements, enforcement and increased safety awareness. Arising from this review, a number of significant new measures have been implemented or are being introduced which together will address the recommendations of the <i>Pisces</i> report. In November 2002 I announced a consultation process on the wearing of lifejackets. I have also strengthened the regulations governing the operation of passenger boats, which carry up to 12 passengers for reward. All exemptions from the licensing requirements under the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 for sea going passenger boats, including boats used for sea angling, have ceased since 1 January 2003. I brought forward the implementation date for new passenger boat regulations to 1 January 2003.

A public consultation process was initiated on this aspect of the review on 19 May and it includes a discussion forum on the Department's website. The closing date for receipt of comments is 27 June. I intend to introduce a new safety code for leisure craft as soon as possible. Under the code owners of vessels will be liable for ensuring that anyone on board their vessel complies with the conditions of the code, such as the wearing of lifejackets. Following examination of the submissions received on the wearing of lifejackets, I will shortly bring in additional legal measures requiring the wearing of lifejackets in a wider array of circumstances than at present.</summary>

My overall objective is to develop a culture of safety in and around water to prevent the tragic accidents that we have seen in recent years. My strategy is to promote the use of vessels which are safe and carry appropriate life saving equipment and to encourage the public to learn about and abide by the safety rules. I am delivering on this strategy through a combination of having in place internationally benchmarked safety legislation applicable to all vessels using our waters, including inland waters, where safety rules are clear; through the provision of public education and awareness programmes, targeted in particular at persons using the water and young people, and utilising a combination of media approaches such as national and local radio campaigns, the distribution of safety information leaflets and a water safety promotion in schools; and a programme of enforcement of the safety legislation by my Department.

On 30 May I announced that I will introduce a new safety code for life jackets and safety equipment on all leisure craft. The onus is being placed on boat and water craft owners and operators to ensure that everyone on board wears a lifejacket.

A new website, www.safetyonthewater.ie, has recently been initiated by my Department and the key messages under this programme include: everyone is responsible for their own safety; the importance of wearing a life jacket and receiving training in safety procedures; and the need to be sure that a boat is licensed before a person pays to go on board.</summary>

During the summer the coast guard units will also visit their local caravan parks and holiday centres distributing safety material and providing advice. Community inshore and coast guard rescue boats will also patrol off busy beaches in support of beach lifeguards. I recently announced a crackdown on passenger boat safety with a campaign of random spot checks this summer.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1272">The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is required, under section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, to have regard to the need to secure that all reasonable demands for electricity by final customers are satisfied, in addition to promoting the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. I have been advised by the CER of the need to obtain at least 300 MW of centrally dispatched, large-scale plant by 2005 in order to meet generation adequacy requirements. This projected capacity requirement has been identified in the most recent forecast statement, entitled Generation Adequacy Report 2003-2009, which was published by ESB National Grid in November 2002, in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">The CER, in exercise of its responsibilities, announced on 20 December 2002 that, following extensive consultation and having examined a number of options, it was of the view that the most appropriate approach to securing additional capacity is to award a contract to one or more successful bidders, through a competitive process for the purchase of 300 MW – 400 MW of electricity. The CER is also of the view that the ESB, operating as the public electricity supplier, PES, is the best placed in the market to offer such a contract.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_96">The CER announced on 23 May 2003 that it had received expressions of interest from seven generators interested in bidding into the competition it is running to facilitate the entry of new generation plant or plants into Ireland. The potential bidders, who have submitted a valid expression of interest, have received from the CER the tender documentation required in order to prepare their bids for the competition. Bidders will compete with one another for the contract or contracts on the basis of price, after having met a number of specified minimum technical, financial and regulatory requirements. According to the CER, the closing date for receipt of tenders is 5 September 2003 and the winner or winners is expected to be announced by the Commission on 20 October 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1279">Investment in the electricity transmission system is an ongoing operational matter for ESB National Grid under the broad supervision of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. ESB's five year network upgrading programme, costing approximately €3 billion, is well under way. In due course, this will yield major improvements in the network system thereby facilitating enhanced capacity and quality of service capability.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_98">In accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, ESB National Grid, in its capacity as transmission system operator, is required to prepare a forecast statement in a form approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation. The forecast statement presents factual information on, and projections of, electricity demand, generation, the transmission network and interconnection with other electricity systems. It also includes the results of analyses that indicate the most suitable locations for the connection of new generation or customer demand. Forecast statements cover a seven year period and are revised on an annual basis. The most recent forecast statement was published earlier this year and it covers the period mid-2003 to end 2009. This document is also accessible at website www.eirgrid.com.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">In accordance with section 35 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Commission for Energy Regulation approves the proposed ESB charges for use of and connection to the transmission system. Site location for wind powered electricity generating stations at this time is a matter for individual developers. Current county development plans do not signal to developers or the network operator the preferred locations for wind powered generating plants from the planning perspective. However, as the compliance of county development plans with the national spatial strategy evolves, clearer signals of preferred areas for wind powered electricity generation stations, from the planning perspective, should emerge. In the meantime support for all renewable energy based electricity generation plants is likely to depend on State intervention to offer dedicated support to selected projects. Up to now the alternative energy requirement, AER, scheme has been the main intervention.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">In addition, in November 2001, a steering group was appointed to prepare an implementation programme for a grid upgrade development programme to address a potential impediment to renewable energy development arising from the grid operator's approved charging mechanisms for connections. The steering group's report was published recently and can be accessed at the Department's website www.dcmnr.ie/energy. The steering group identified five clusters of renewable energy projects which could qualify for investment support under the ESIOP national development plan. An agreed charging mechanism was recommended by the steering group. The developers identified in each cluster have been notified and asked to contact the ESB to explore the potential use of the programme. Simultaneously my Department is in consultation with the grid operators and CER about formalising the grid upgrade development programme. In liberalising a market which has evolved over more than 75 years, it is not possible to fully disentangle the advantages and disadvantages of incumbency to the extent implied in the latter part of the question.</summary>

As the Deputy may be aware I recently published the report of the high level review of State commercial ports operating the Harbours Act, 1996 to 2000, along with the report of the ministerial task force on port estates. I also published a consultation foreword-policy statement, outlining the key aspects of the reports and my own personal perspective on the findings of both reports. A full consultation process has been initiated inviting all interested persons, bodies and stakeholders to make submissions and-or representations on the findings of both these reports. It is my intention that the results of the consultative process will feed into and inform future policy deliberations as to how to best manage and operate the ports in the future. Rosslare Port is not governed by the Harbours Acts and its development is a matter for Iarnród Éireann.</p>

The regulation of content is specifically excluded from the scope of the directives implementing that regulatory package and thus the transposing regulations will not result in providers of television services being subject to regulation on broadcasting content in this State. In the context of the transposition into Irish law of the European regulatory package, the extent to which the package applies to other aspects of the provision of television services in the State by satellite as well as other platforms arises. Such aspects include access to facilities, quality of service and consumer protection.</p>

The purpose of the regulations is to transpose the European Parliament and Council directive concerning the further opening to competition of community postal services. Under these regulations the postal market was further liberalised from the beginning of January this year. The area reserved to An Post is confined to items which weigh less than 100 grams and where the price limit is less than three times the standard tariff. Outbound international mail will be fully liberalised from next year and the postal market will be further liberalised in 2006 when the weight limit will be reduced to 50 grams and the price limit to two and a half times the standard tariff.</p>

In regard to proposals for liberalisation of the postal market by the EU, the Commission has set a target date of 2009 for full liberalisation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">However, in advance of any agreement on full liberalisation, the Commission intends to undertake a study for each member state on the impact of full liberalisation on universal service provision.

However, it was recognised that specific support was needed for improving marine access infrastructure, such as marinas, berths and slipways, and an amount of €25.4 million was allocated to the marine tourism grant scheme, a sub-measure of the overall tourism measure under the NDP. This scheme was administered by my Department, but unfortunately, all moneys allocated are fully committed to existing projects.</p>

In addition, the Marine Institute, which is entirely grant-aided by my Department, as part of its overall remit for marine research and development, supports a marine leisure and tourism research and development programme. The Marine Institute works closely with the tourism bodies, local authorities and the industry in identifying sectoral potential and development opportunities. For example, the Institute has funded a pilot project with Donegal County Council which has resulted in the appointment of a full-time marine leisure development officer and the preparation of a county development board marine strategy.

          <p eId="para_1319">Having regard to the terms of the sale, which involved the retention by the INPC of the company's existing debt and a number of other responsibilities having financial implications, it is estimated that the final net return to the exchequer will be between €30 million and €40 million. Of this amount, which represents a very positive financial outcome for the State, INPC has already paid €20 million to the exchequer. The company is not yet in a position to definitively determine and pay over the final balance because a number of outstanding matters have still to be resolved. These matters, comprising chiefly of environmental claims and a contractual dispute, have potential financial implications. Until these matters have been finalised the INPC, having regard to the Companies Acts, will not be in a position to divest itself of its remaining financial assets.</p>

The details of these claims are a day-to-day matter for the INPC and it is not appropriate for me to elaborate on them or their merits at this stage. The contractual dispute referred to is a commercial dispute with a customer and also a day-to-day matter. Because of the close involvement of third parties in the unresolved matters, neither INPC nor my Department can say when the remaining proceeds will be made available to the exchequer. However, I expect that a further, though not necessarily final, payment may be made before the end of the year.</summary>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       his Department's policy to reduce the level of catch of cetaceans in Irish fisheries; and his views on whether Ireland should make similar commitments to those agreed by a number of EU states who are parties to the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas which has identified interim conservation objectives for small cetaceans.

          <p eId="para_1336">While the level of cetacean by-catch in the Irish fishing fleet has not been high, my Department remains concerned to minimise this by-catch. In this regard Bord Iascaigh Mhara, an agency of my Department, has been working with the fishing industry since 1998 to develop new techniques to prevent or significantly reduce incidences of cetacean by-catch. Minor adjustments to fishing practices in relation to fishing times and areas have been shown to have a significant impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">In addition, BIM, in conjunction with Aquatec Subsea Limited. and Loughborough University, developed a practical underwater acoustic alarm system, which emits loud noises that discourage cetaceans from approaching fishing nets. In 2002 this system was used during trials and proved very successful, reducing the level of cetacean by-catch in the tuna fishery by over 90%. Further testing and proofing of this system will be carried out during 2003. BIM, in conjunction with its counterpart agencies in other member states, is awaiting EU approval for a further project involving the development of gear modifications in co-operation with the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">Ireland is not a signatory to the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas, which relates to the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Much of the fishing in our Exclusive Economic Zone is carried out by fleets from member states who are not signatories of the ASCOBANS agreement and to that extent the agreement cannot easily be applied in the area known as the western waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">It is understood that the Commission will shortly present proposals in relation to the reduction or elimination of cetacean by-catches. I consider that the task of evaluating the most applicable and relevant measures for particular areas and fisheries will be informed by the work carried out by BIM and other relevant experience.</p>

          <p eId="para_1342">I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 129 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing sporting organisations throughout the country. The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. I chair a Ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant departments. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The Interim Personal Injuries Assessment Board is up and running and legislation is being prepared to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis. The Government has recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation by year-end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is preparing a Bill to reform the law on personal injuries which will include measures to deal with spurious and/or exaggerated claims, the issue of costs arising from unsuccessful claims and double compensation. My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on competition in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">EU law prevents governments from intervening in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. However, Governments are free to take appropriate action to improve the functioning of the insurance market. I am determined that significant cost reductions will be achieved through implementation of the programme.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1348">The Commission's amended proposal of 28 November 2002, Document COM (2002) 701 Final, has been the subject of detailed consideration by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council and was the subject of a lengthy debate at the council meeting on 3 June 2003, which I attended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">I regret that it was not possible for the Council of Ministers, notwithstanding the constructive efforts made by the Greek Presidency, to arrive at a balanced compromise solution which could be agreed by all member states on 3 June. There is continuing disagreement surrounding three issues: the concept of a qualifying period which would apply before temporary agency workers would secure basic pay parity and equivalent conditions to those of the permanent employees in the enterprises to which they are assigned ; the duration of such a qualifying period, and whether it should be time-limited or transitional in character; and whether the provisions for the protection of the temporary agency workers should be complemented the prohibition of restrictions or prohibitions on agency work which do not have the protection of agency workers and health and safety as their objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">The European Commission's proposal would have allowed the temporary agency businesses a six-week qualifying period before temporary agency workers assigned to a user enterprise would qualify for the same terms and conditions as permanent employees. The concept of such a qualifying period is opposed by eleven member states. Ireland has been seeking, together with three other countries, to secure a significant lengthening of a qualifying period originally proposed by the Commission.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_111">An extended qualifying period is essential to enable companies to develop the job performance of temporary agency workers and to enable them to acquire the on-the-job training and experience required to be legitimately compared with permanent full-time employees. Ireland has consistently sought to secure a flexible framework which would enable member states to transpose the equal treatment provisions in a manner consistent with promoting job creation and making temporary agency work more attractive, while taking into account the varying labour market conditions pertaining to the different member states. The social partner organisations were consulted on the Commission's proposal and are fully aware of the position taken by Ireland on this measure.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1360">Applications from Defence Forces members to transfer from one service corps to another service corps are governed by provisions in Defence Force regulations. The current position is that there is no requirement for personnel to resign formally from one service corps before being allowed to join another.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">With regard to transfers from the Naval Service to the Army, the current position is that, in accordance with Defence Force regulations, personnel may transfer within the Defence Forces subject to certain conditions. In the Naval Service context, transfers are usually sought from the Naval Service to Army units, rarely the other way round. Invariably personnel seek transfer to a specific unit and-or location. It can happen that the unit to which transfer is sought has no vacancies and cannot accept transfer. Equally, it can happen that the unit to which transfer is sought has no vacancies at the applicants rank-grade and personnel can only accept transfers at a lower rank or grade. In these circumstances there is no requirement for personnel to resign formally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">However, there may be cases whereby NCOs formally resign from the Naval Service and rejoin the Army at a lower rank or grade. Provided such personnel rejoin within six months they will be re-enlisted in the Army in the rank of private, three star without the requirement to undergo initial military training and, accordingly, maintain their entitlement to military service allowance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1382">As I have said on many occasions, a wide range of important issues must be considered in the process of reaching a Government decision on decentralisation.

          <p eId="para_1383">While the deliberative process is ongoing it would be premature and inappropriate to identify a particular location, or a Department or office, or a section within a Department or office, or numbers of staff which might be selected for inclusion in the new programme of decentralisation.</p>

The millennium partnership fund for disadvantage is one of the initiatives in place to promote equity in access.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families.

          <p eId="para_1419">I have given approval for the establishment of the national office within the Higher Education Authority. My Department is engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to bringing the national office into operation in time for the 2003-04 academic year.

The details for the remaining years are being compiled at present and I will arrange to pass these to the Deputy in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_1444">My Department's policy on the retention of pupils in primary schools is set out in primary circular 11/01 which issued to all primary schools in March 2001. The primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course, including a two year infant cycle followed by six years in standards from first to sixth, with children progressing to the next grade at the end of each school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">My Department is providing considerable support for pupils with learning difficulties in schools. Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants, computer equipment and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged are among the forms of provision allocated to schools for these pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">Under my Department's policy, pupils should only repeat a year for educational reasons and under no circumstances should an additional grade level – middle infants or repeat sixth class – operate through the retention of all or a substantial number of pupils for a second year at a grade level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">In accordance with the terms of the circular, a principal teacher should consult the learning support teacher, class teacher and parents of a pupil and if all parties conclude that the pupil would benefit educationally by repeating a class, the pupil may be retained. However, a record outlining the educational basis for the decision to retain a pupil in class for a second year should be kept for any pupil retained. In addition, there should be a clear programme outlined for such a pupil that records precisely what new approach will be used for her or him and what its expected benefit will be. These records should be retained within the school and should be brought to the attention of the inspector. A pupil should not be retained for longer than one year in a primary school.</p>

          <p eId="para_1461">The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before he may be enrolled in a national school. Of primary school pupils, 5.83% are four year olds and 11.81% are five year olds. It is the policy of my Department to continue to support the choices made by parents in regard to the age at which they wish to enrol their children in school. For most parents, in most countries, that choice appears to be about the time their child is approaching five years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1462">International comparative statistics on age of commencement of formal education show that in most countries parents make a similar choice, although the range typically varies from four to seven years of age. Research tells us that early childhood education and the curriculum should build on pupils' previous home experiences and should cater for individual differences in those experiences, in ability, needs and development. Consequently, early childhood education is less formal than in the past and emphasises the importance of play, activity, the manipulation of materials, social interaction and, above all, the centrality of language in early childhood learning. This is true of all developed countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children from birth to six years. The Centre for Early Childhood Education, which was established in 2002 at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, will have an important role to play in the development of a national quality framework for early childhood education services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1474">The time at which projects listed in these sections are permitted to progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475">The position on public private partnerships, PPPs, is that under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as PPPs, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance, GGB, over the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the stability and growth pact of the Maastricht treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue as is a standing committee established by my colleague the Minister for Finance to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects.</p>

          <p eId="para_1480">The refusal of planning permission by An Bord Pleanála for the proposed terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge for the development of the Corrib gas field was made solely in relation to certain technical issues concerning the moving and relocation of large volumes of peat. The Corrib gas field was discovered in 1996 under Frontier Exploration Licence 3/94. The 1992 terms apply, and will continue to apply to this gas discovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">The present licensing terms and financial and fiscal regime were introduced in 1992 to keep exploration in Ireland at a sustainable level. These addressed the falling levels of both exploration and commercial finds, and sought to make exploration in Ireland attractive when the industry in several other countries in north west Europe were enjoying commercial finds. The terms and financial regime have been implemented, without change, by every Government since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">Despite the relative attractiveness of these terms, no company has benefited from them to date. The terms are, of course, only of benefit where a company makes a petroleum discovery, and the discovery is commercial, and is developed, and its development is profitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">The terms reflect the realities that Ireland has not had the commercial success in oil and gas discoveries that for example the UK and Norway have had. They are necessary to attract exploration interest, due to the conditions in the Irish offshore. The average water depth in the North Sea is 200 metres, and a well costs up to €8 million. This compares to depths of up to 2,500 metres in the Porcupine Basin where a well could cost in excess of €20 million. The Dooish well was drilled in almost 1,500 metres of water. Lack of commercial finds has resulted in an absence of infrastructure in terms of production platforms and pipelines. This means that an operator with a commercial find, such as Corrib, has to build its own infrastructure and this adds to the development cost, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

          <p eId="para_1561">Ireland is part of a wider global economy where it is necessary to compete at the highest level in a communications environment. Despite difficult market conditions, change and market development continue to be key features of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">My Department is focused on the issues raised by technology convergence and the blurring of traditional boundaries in regulation, legislation, service provision, technologies and business models in the sector. Public policy issues including the digital divide, environment issues, research and development and spatial planning are being addressed. My Department's legislative and infrastructure support programmes are a key element in promoting the development of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1563">The independent regulation of the sector must continue to evolve in line with the needs of a rapidly developing market while at the same time ensuring that the interests of stakeholders are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564">A new European regulatory package is required to be transposed into national law in member states by 25 July 2003, and my officials are engaged in ongoing work directed at meeting that deadline. The public consultation process on the transposing regulations provided a very valuable input into that process. A further directive on data protection in electronic communications is due to be transposed into national law by 31 October 2003.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_117">My Department's programmes under the national development plan also facilitate the development of competition in relation to broadband and Internet provision. My Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1568">Within the last 18 months, two petroleum leases, for the Corrib gas field and the Seven Heads gas accumulation, have been signed. Production from Seven Heads is set to commence later this year and production from Corrib will depend on the outcome of the developers re-evaluation of options following the refusal of planning permission by An Bord Pleanála. In addition there will be a small satellite development, south-west Kinsale Greensand, in the Kinsale gas field to access gas reserves that were not being drained effectively by the existing Kinsale gas field wells. The target date for gas production is July 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569">Last November, I launched the Porcupine licensing initiative. Its purpose is to re-open the Porcupine region, closed since 1999, for exploration. The region will be opened for licensing in four tranches as it covers a large area, 241 full blocks. Some wells have been drilled there in the past but it still has real exploration potential. Regrettably, there were no applications in relation to the first tranche which had a closing date of 15 March 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_118">The results from the Dooish well which was drilled off Donegal last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland also gives grounds for optimism. The company are carrying out further appraisal of the well this year. My Department has long held that there is exploration potential within these frontier areas and these results further vindicate this view. A further exploration well will be drilled by Statoil in the Slyne-Erris basin in 2003 under a licence commitment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">With regard to non-petroleum minerals no new economic deposits have been discovered in recent years. There have been some encouraging results, however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, County Meath – Tara Mines Limited – and Galmoy, County Kilkenny – Arcon Mines Limited – has discovered additional resources which have the potential to extend the life of those mines. A good zinc prospect area near Pallasgreen, County Limerick, also has the potential to host an economic deposit and exploration is continuing. The acid test of commerciality with any new discovery is that having made a find the explorationist is then prepared to invest in planning for mining and so makes the necessary applications for permits to me, to the relevant county council and to the EPA. New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of prospecting licences, of which there were 315 current at the end of May 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1571">The roll-out of broadband telecommunications technology is an issue which my Department is actively pursuing. While the provision of broadband services and broadband technology has been primarily a matter for the deregulated marketplace, my Department has been actively encouraging and trialling the deployment of the latest broadband technologies. My Department has just completed trials of broadband technology using satellite technology and is currently in the process of evaluating the success of the trial. These trials have involved the demonstration of the delivery of broadband services to remote areas in Ireland including the islands. At present, my Department is working closely with a number of local authorities around the country in the building of metropolitan area networks, in 19 towns, which will greatly assist in the deployment of broadband using the latest optic fibre technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572">My Department is also in the process of trialling the delivery of broadband using wireless technology. This trial should be completed in the next few months and has provided the opportunity for deployment of broadband using the latest wireless technology in new and innovative ways.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_120">The delivery of broadband services using a technology called power line carriers is also now being considered by my Department. This technology allows broadband services to be carried on electricity cables and provides an alternative method for the delivery of broadband telecommunications services. I look forward to announcing the details of this trial in the near future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_121">In terms of the roll-out of broadband in Ireland, I am advised that there are now around 800,000 telephone lines in Ireland which are capable of supporting digital subscriber loop, DSL, technology. This figure represents a significant improvement in the deployment of broadband technology and I am advised that the number of DSL enabled exchanges will continue to rise. Other technologies such as the upgrading of cable television networks for the provision of broadband will further enhance this figure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_122">I am also aware that the Commission for Communications Regulation has licenced new third generation mobile operators who will in the future provide a new technology platform for the delivery of broadband. I am confident that the continued deployment of these technologies will offer the Irish consumer more choice. In the final analysis, customer choice and competition will play an important role in stimulating the demand for broadband services.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1574">Mobile networks in Ireland are constantly evolving. The operators are developing their current networks to provide new applications based on data services. Recent surveys indicate a market penetration of 79%. This equates to approximately three million subscribers. In addition to the mobile cellular networks, other networks such as wireless local area networks are being developed and the deputy is no doubt aware that I have funded some trials of this technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">Concerning future networks, the Commission for Communications Regulation has, following a competition, issued three licenses for the next generation of mobile networks called third generation or 3G. The development of third generation networks worldwide has not been as fast as previously envisaged. It is expected that roll-out of third generation mobile services will take place in Ireland at about the same time as these services are being launched in the EU generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_1579">The Marine Institute carries out Irish stock monitoring programmes which feed into the work of other scientific bodies such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, to determine the current status of EU fish stocks. On the basis of the most recent advice, there is a serious concern that many stocks appear to be outside safe biological limits. In so far as the areas and species most affected are concerned, there is particular concern about a number of key whitefish stocks throughout Community waters, in particular cod and hake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1580">Interim stock recovery measures have been introduced for a number of stocks, including Irish Sea cod, northern hake and cod in the North Sea and west of Scotland. The Commission has recently presented new proposals for long – term recovery plans for a number of cod stocks. Additional proposals concerning hake are expected shortly. The intention is to have such plans in place from the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581">Ireland has been at the forefront at EU level in pushing for enhanced conservation measures to protect fish stocks. I will continue to push for further systematic action in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1583">Surveys in relation to employment in the Irish seafood industry, comprising fishing, aquaculture, processing and ancillary sectors are carried out by del Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, on a periodic basis. The most recent survey carried out in 2000 estimated that some 15,200 people were employed in the sector in both full-time and part-time jobs. This translates into some 11,920 full time equivalent jobs. The previous survey, completed in 1997, estimated full and part-time employment at 15,800 or 12,130 full-time equivalents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584">Overall employment levels have decreased by almost 4% over the period covered by both surveys.

I am satisfied that the seafood industry continues to offer valuable employment in the regions and coastal communities where alternative opportunities are limited. BIM, in partnership with the ESRI, is carrying out a survey to determine current levels of employment in the sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_1587">In our liberalised telecommunications market, it is primarily a matter for the private sector operators to invest in the appropriate infrastructure and services. In terms of investment, the role of my Department is to address priority areas where the private sector alone will not deliver the necessary infrastructure within the time scale necessary to critical national development objectives. Nonetheless, I am conscious of the impact on competitiveness for Ireland and its businesses of modern communications infrastructure in attracting and retaining foreign direct investment in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588">Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, provision has been made for significant investment in telecommunications infrastructure.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_123">A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and, on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001, which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. Projects funded under this call include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom and accelerating Esat BT's rollout of DSL in 40 locations. The second call for proposals resulted in the regional broadband programme, which is my Department's most ambitious telecommunications project to date. The objective of this programme is to foster real competition among service providers on the basis of price and service, through the provision of open access to broadband infrastructure, constructed in 19 towns around the country. The regional broadband programme involves an investment by my Department of over €65 million and it is expected that all networks will be fully complete and operational by July 2004.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1590">The Government recognises the critical importance of securing a competitive, modern and safe Irish fleet and to this end some €95 million is being invested in the whitefish fleet under the National Development Plan 2000-06. This investment is building on the 1998-99 programme which has already seen €100 million invested in whitefish fleet renewal. Whitefish fleet development has been a particular priority and the Government has delivered on this priority by approving 70 renewal and modernisation projects, involving investment of €63.5 million under the current programme. In addition, investment of €1 million has been approved for vessel safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">I am satisfied the investments supported by the Government in the period 1998-2006 have already substantially enhanced the competitiveness of our whitefish fleet and will continue to do so.

          <p eId="para_1603">The key tourism objectives under the national development plan are to increase overseas revenue earnings and per diem visitor yield, and to help the industry achieve a wider seasonal and regional distribution of tourist business, thereby contributing to sustainable development goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1604">Over the first three years of the plan, Irish tourism experienced a number of major challenges and setbacks which are having a continuing impact on the industry in the international marketplace. The first year of the plan, 2000, was a record year for tourism in Ireland, both in terms of overseas visitor numbers and foreign earnings. However, with the double blow of the foot and mouth crisis and 11 September in the US, 2001 was the first year in well over a decade in which visitor numbers declined – they were down 5%. The following year, 2002, also proved to be difficult and challenging for tourism, particularly in the context of the continuing fall-out from 11 September on consumer travel behaviour, the unfavourable economic conditions in Ireland's key tourism markets and the deterioration in access capacity from markets such as the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605">Despite these adverse market conditions, some key targets have been met and, in certain cases, exceeded. Foreign earnings, excluding receipts to Irish carriers, of €3.267 billion in 2002 have exceeded the mid-term target of €2.918 billion, with average annual growth exceeding the 5% growth target. While a greater regional spread of tourism has not yet been realised, primarily as a result of the fall-off in longer-stay visitors from the US, the target for greater seasonal spread was achieved in 2002, with a shift of 2% away from the peak months of July and August. The mid-term target for <i>per diem </i>yield has also been met.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_124">The combined impact of the Iraqi war, the spread of SARS and a continuing sluggishness in the economies of our main source markets has turned 2003 into yet another testing year for Irish tourism. Clearly, such external shocks make the achievement of the NDP targets for tourism increasingly difficult. However, with the wind-down of the Iraq conflict, there are encouraging signs of a recovery in some of our main markets. I am confident that over the remaining three years of the national development plan, Irish tourism has the capacity to out-perform its competitors and achieve the ambitious targets set for it.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_125">The objective of improving the spatial spread of tourism in Ireland is particular relevant in the case of the tourism product development scheme, funded under the local enterprise development priority under the NDP's two regional operational programmes. Unfortunately, no progress has been reported to date in relation to the targets specific to this scheme. This is because there was a delay in securing State aids clearance from the European Commission and the scheme, which is implemented by Fáilte Ireland was not launched until early 2002. However, since then, some 265 applications have been received under the scheme and it is expected, following the rigorous assessment process, that final decisions in respect of grant allocations will be made by the independent management boards over the coming months. Because of the late start to the scheme, it is not possible to say at this stage, if the specific targets will be met, although I am hopeful that they will.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_126">Finally, with regard to marketing and training supports for the tourism industry, I can report that there has been good progress against the general expenditure targets set under the NDP.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1667">The probation and welfare service office to be established in Donaghmede will be a local office rather than a regional office. The probation and welfare service has moved towards localisation of its offices within the past number of years. Local service delivery enhances co-operation from those people working with the service who are normally also based locally. In Dublin, the service has been successful in establishing offices in Dún Laoghaire, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas, Crumlin and Clondalkin. These offices are situated in local communities, alongside businesses, over shops, and within industrial units. No complaint has been received by the probation and welfare service to date from any member of the public about the behaviour of those attending a local office, nor has any complaint been brought to the attention of any officer of the service about the behaviour of those attending a local office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1668">The premises concerned were identified over three years ago by the service and the Office of Public Works as being suitable for a probation and welfare service local office. A lease was subsequently arranged with the owners of the shopping centre. Planning permission was sought and obtained in 2002 to adapt the building to service the needs of the service. It should be noted that the probation and welfare service will, for the most part, deal with people attending the office only on an appointment basis to meet their obligations to the courts or if they are in crisis due to homelessness or other personal or family difficulty. Clients include those on whom the court has ordered reports prior to considering the type of sanction it will impose and those who are on statutory orders, either a probation order or a community service order, from the court. In addition, parents whose children's behaviour is causing them concern often seek advice from service personnel. Others who visit service local offices include lawyers, gardaí, other statutory and voluntary agencies and representatives of local communities. There is no reason to believe the Donaghmede office will be any different from the other local offices in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1669">While I appreciate that many people would feel that such offices would act as a magnet for undesirables, they do not have that effect in practice. Indeed, they are far less likely to attract any such persons than a busy criminal solicitor's office would. I met representatives of the residents, associations adjacent to Donaghmede Shopping Centre in October 2002 and recently held a further meeting with local elected representatives on this matter. During these meetings, I acknowledged the concerns expressed about the possible impact on the area. However, I also encouraged all concerned to give the probation and welfare service the opportunity to demonstrate that the office can operate to professional standards as in the rest of the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_137">A monitoring group for the office will be established comprising representatives of the residents, traders of the shopping centre, the property management group, the probation and welfare service and the Garda. The Minister has confirmed that it will be open to the monitoring group to seek a review of the decision to open the office after a period of six to 12 months in operation. A safety statement for the office, including protocols and procedures will be drawn up by the probation and welfare service. I intend to take appropriate action, if in the collective opinion of the monitoring group, it transpires that the presence of the office is linked to a significant rise in criminality in the area.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1677">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 201 to 207, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1678">The issue of ground rents is a complex one as indicated by the number of different aspects raised in the Deputy's questions. I confirm that the Government legislative programme makes provision for the publication of a Ground Rents Bill during 2003 with a view to abolishing ground rents. The fact that the Bill is included in the programme is an indication of the Government's intention to act in this matter. As I have stated previously, publication of the Ground Rents Bill is subject to the resolution of possible constitutional, technical and practical difficulties. The constitutional difficulties referred to concern the respective rights of ground rent tenants and landlords. I am sure the Deputy would want the Government to introduce a Bill which is fair and equitable and which will not adversely affect the constitutional rights of any person. We are working to achieve this solution. Consequently, I am not in a position to give a publication date at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1679">I would like to correct a misapprehension of the Deputy in relation to ground rents. A ground rent is not a lease on a domestic dwelling but rather a rent which is a charge in respect of the soil or ground itself. The relationship between landlord and tenant in such a situation is based on contract and payment is made in the form of a ground rent. I am aware that in many cases demands for ground rents have not been made for a long number of years. In these cases, where a ground rent landlord subsequently makes a demand for payment, the landlord is statute barred from claiming more than six years arrears in the rent. I should also point out that section 27 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 provides that a landlord cannot re-enter or take possession of a premises where the tenant is in arrears with a ground rent.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_138">Lest there be any confusion in relation to the current situation on ground rents, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling houses Part III of the Act, provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 23 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the Act.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1681">As the Deputies are aware, in 1998 my predecessor requested the Garda Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in the child care area generally. Arising from this review it was decided that a central vetting unit would be set up to deal with the then known demand for clearances. In July 2001 sanction was received for the recruitment of additional staff for the new unit to be based in Garda headquarters and following recruitment and training of the new staff the unit commenced operations on 2 January, 2002. The unit currently processes clearance requests in respect of prospective employees entering full-time employment in the health care area who have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1682">When the central vetting became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared it was envisaged that a phased extension of the clearance arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end a working group has been established by the Garda Commissioner to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons, be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placements. The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and the Attorney General's office have been requested to participate in the working group. The work of the group is ongoing at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1687">I refer to the reply to Question No. 883 of 29 January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1688">In general, where an activity that involves a risk to groundwater is being carried on by any person, that person carries primary responsibility for protecting the groundwater against pollution. It is an offence for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, including an aquifer, and a person can be held liable for all measures necessary to mitigate or remedy any damage caused to an aquifer. Among public authorities, responsibility for the protection of groundwater is assigned primarily to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related regulations. The EPA exercises general supervision under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 in relation to the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions and has responsibility for groundwater protection in the context of its own licensing, monitoring and other functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1689">Complementary controls in relation to the extraction of minerals and other materials such as sand, gravel, stone or clay are exercised by authorities such as planning authorities, the EPA and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Under the provisions of the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is empowered to issue prospecting licences and subsequently, when an economic deposit has been defined, a State mining facility in relation to the extraction of minerals. Planning permission and an integrated pollution control, IPC, licence must be obtained before the commencement of commercial extraction of minerals. In such cases, appropriate controls on emissions are incorporated in the IPC licence granted by the EPA, including controls in relation to matters such as emissions to air and water, noise – including vibration, waste storage and disposal.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_140">The operation of a quarry constitutes development which requires planning permission and, in the case of activities involving the extraction of materials such as sand, gravel, stone or clay, conditions may be attached to a planning permission to provide for appropriate controls on emissions. Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 will introduce additional controls on the operation of quarries. Detailed guidance for the assistance of planning authorities on the implementation of these provisions is currently being prepared in my Department. It is intended to commence this section of the Act following the publication of the guidance in the autumn.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">Guidelines, prepared jointly by the GSI, the EPA and my Department, on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes, were issued to local authorities in May 1999. These schemes provide a systematic framework for the protection of groundwater by public authorities in the discharge of their functions under the Planning Acts, the Waste Management Act, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, and other legislation. Groundwater protection schemes have been made in relation to five counties, in consultation with the Geological Survey of Ireland, and a further eight are in preparation at present.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1770">The office for social inclusion in my Department is currently engaged in co-ordinating the preparation of Ireland's National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-2005. All member states of the European Union are required to submit their national action plans to the EU Commission by the 31 July, 2003. The preparation of the plan has involved an extensive process of consultation, organised in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency, and has included regional and national seminars and a public invitation for written submissions.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_142">The joint submission from Focus Ireland, the Irish Traveller Movement, the Simon Community of Ireland, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and Threshold is one of many submissions received in response to this invitation. It focuses in particular on a key area – that of housing and accommodation – which is of specific interest to each of these bodies. All of the submissions received, together with the outcomes of the wider public consultation, are now being examined and assessed by the relevant Departments and will be taken into account in the context of the preparation of the national action plan.</summary>
