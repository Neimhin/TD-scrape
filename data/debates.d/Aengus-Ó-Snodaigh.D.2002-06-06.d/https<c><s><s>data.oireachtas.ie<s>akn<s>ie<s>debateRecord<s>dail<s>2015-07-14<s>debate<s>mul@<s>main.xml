            <p eId="para_1">89. <b>Deputy Brendan Smith</b> asked the <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> in view of the recent terrorist attack in Tunisia, the protocols and procedures his Department has in effect to ensure the safety of Irish citizens travelling throughout the world; if his Department has consulted with his Government and European colleagues with regard to ensuring the security of Irish citizens abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">On 26 June, 38 people were murdered at random in a holiday resort in Tunisia. Those victims included three Irish people. That massacre of innocent people by terrorists awakened in all of us the need to be more vigilant when we prepare to travel to some countries where there is instability or ongoing conflict. Does the Minister ensure that all travel advice offered by his Department is updated regularly and is robust enough to provide the best possible assistance and guidance to Irish people who propose to travel to some particular destinations?</p>

            <p eId="para_3">We have all been deeply shocked and saddened by the recent event at Sousse in Tunisia, where three Irish citizens lost their lives in this terrible atrocity. I condemn unreservedly these terrorist attacks and other recent attacks elsewhere. I take this opportunity to again convey my deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the families of the three Irish citizens who lost their lives in the tragedy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Officials in my Department and our embassy in Madrid were immediately deployed to respond to the consular needs of Irish citizens who were caught up in the attack. In responding to crisis situations where Irish citizens may be affected, my Department has a detailed emergency consular response plan in place and a standing emergency consular response centre that can be activated at short notice to provide assistance and advice to citizens and their families. The response centre was activated once news of the attack in Sousse was received by the Department and remained in operation until 6 p.m. the following day, Saturday.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> To assist those travelling overseas to make well-informed decisions, the Government publishes country specific travel advice on my Department’s website. This advice is published to make useful information available to assist Irish citizens when planning their trips or when travelling. This advice is reviewed on an ongoing basis and is updated in the light of information received from the Department’s network of missions abroad following consultations with, or advice received from, relevant actors such as national governments, security authorities and EU partners on the ground. In particular, it is updated where there are emergency situations affecting Irish citizens or tourists generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> In the specific case of the travel advice for Tunisia, having consulted relevant agencies and our international partners, our travel advice was changed to advise against all non-essential travel, the second-highest warning category on our five-point scale for travel advice. We are now encouraging any Irish citizens in Tunisia to review whether their presence in Tunisia is essential. Where this is not the case, we are advising them to leave by commercial means.</p>

            <p eId="para_7">I join with the Minister in extending our sincere sympathies to the families who lost loved ones in that terrible atrocity. We had an opportunity at the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee to pass on our condolences and condemn this massacre of innocent people in the strongest possible manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> Following the upgrade in advice given by the Department, has there been an increase in registrations with the Department of people proposing to travel abroad to areas where there is conflict or instability? We are all guilty of travelling to such areas but not registering with the Department. One of the reasons I tabled this question was to get a better awareness among people that they should register with the Department if they are travelling to such countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> I take the opportunity again to compliment the Minister and his departmental officials on the timely and worthy manner in which they made every effort to assist those families affected in these most difficult of circumstances. I know the Department and its officials abroad do us all proud in their work at the most difficult of times when such families are so vulnerable and need assistance to minimise in some way the desperate hardship and trauma they are going through at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_10">Deputy Smith makes an important point in respect of registration. In addition to publishing travel advice and ensuring the travel advice is constantly under review and updated in accordance with the information received and the circumstances on the ground, we operate a citizen registration facility which allows Irish citizens to register their contact details with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure they are easily contactable in the event of an emergency. There has been an increase in registration and I would avail of the opportunity to advise on the importance of registration. I would encourage and advise all travellers, particular those who are travelling to remote destinations or locations where they may be at risk, to register on the Department's website. Registration can be completed on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, <i>www.dfa.ie</i>. While we encourage travellers to register their details, it is not possible for us to compel citizens to avail of this facility. They are under no obligation to do so but I would strongly recommend that they do, and I am sure everybody in the House would agree with that advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">Will the Minister give a clear assurance on Irish citizens' rights to seek assistance from other EU member state embassies in countries where we do not have diplomatic representation and that the European External Action Service is available to citizens where Ireland does not have diplomatic representation? Will the Minister also give an assurance that this issue and the issue of the terrorist threat that exists in many places at present will be issues for major discussion at the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council?</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> Could he also give us an assurance that our diplomatic service remains in constant contact with colleagues from other diplomatic services on potential threats that exist in countries where Irish citizens may be travelling as well and that it is not only in the aftermath of a terrorist attack that we collate as much information but that such should be ongoing at all times?</p>

            <p eId="para_13">In Tunisia and a number of destinations where Irish citizens travel, we do not have a resident full-time ambassadorial presence. In that regard, we rely significantly on our good relations with neighbour states, in particular, EU states. There is a positive and active relationship to ensure we have assistance on the ground in the first instance but also that we have the appropriate information by way of intelligence, advice and guidance that may be available to states that have a specific presence on the ground in any appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> In response to the massacre in Tunisia, an extraordinary meeting of the Political and Security Committee was convened in Brussels on 28 June. During the course of this meeting, the Irish representative to the committee raised a number of issues stating that the goal of terrorists is not only to attack foreigners but also to undermine the democratic process in the birthplace of the Arab spring. The European Union and its member states must do all they can to assist the Tunisians in preventing the terrorists from achieving these objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> I expect this matter will be the subject of discussion at the forthcoming European Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels next week. I would say that we need an assessment as to whether there is more the European Union can do to assist Tunisia in countering radicalisation, delivering capacity building against violent extremism and ensuring there is an element of training assistance on the matter of counter-terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">We need to work with the Tunisians to ensure the best possible level of co-operation between the security services on the matter of intelligence sharing. I assure the Deputy that, as regards countries in which we do not have a full-time presence on the ground, we will ensure through our good and positive relations with EU partners that the best advice will be available to us. In the case of Tunisia, I acknowledge the rapid response of our embassy in Madrid that has specific accreditation in Tunis. Its team were on the ground in Tunisia within a matter of hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">90. <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b> asked the <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> his plans to ensure outstanding issues in relation to the Stormont House Agreement and previous multi-party agreements are implemented; and the measures his Department is taking to ensure the devolution of fiscal powers to Stormont to ensure sustainable and workable budgets may be agreed.

            <p eId="para_18">In my question I ask the Government about its plans to deal with the outstanding issues arising from the Stormont House Agreement and previous agreements and call on it to ensure fiscal powers are transferred in order that there can be a sustainable and workable budget in the North in the future. In the most recent budget we saw the scale of the cuts imposed by the Tory Government which did not win a single seat in the North.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_19">The full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement remains a priority of the Government and continues to be a key focus in contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, discussed implementation of the Agreement at their meeting in London on 18 June, underlining the collective benefit of full implementation. To continue to take forward this work, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Sherlock, and I attended an implementation and review meeting on the Stormont House Agreement in Belfast on 25 June. This was an important opportunity to take stock of progress, including in the context of the ongoing political impasse in relation to welfare reform and wider budgetary issues. The meeting considered and approved for publication a progress report which outlined overall implementation of the agreement, including work towards establishing new mechanisms to deal with the legacy of the past. In addition to the new mechanisms, the Northern Ireland Executive has undertaken to take appropriate steps to improve the way the legacy inquest function is conducted to comply with the requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. </p>
            <p eId="para_20"> While good progress has been made across many of the Agreement's work streams, a way forward needs to be found in relation to the ongoing impasse on welfare reform and wider budgetary issues. There is a limited window of opportunity to resolve these issues. It is essential that the political leaders in Northern Ireland face up to their responsibility to find a sustainable solution to the issues at hand and intensify their efforts in delivering the Agreement as a whole. The Irish Government will continue to support this collective effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> With regard to the devolution of fiscal powers from Westminster to the Northern Ireland Assembly, this matter has been progressed by the British Government and the necessary Westminster legislation to allow for devolution of corporation tax was completed in March. The commencement of the legislation will be a matter for the British Government in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">Mention was made of the new mechanisms for dealing with the legacy of the past and it is to be welcomed that there is progress on that issue. I do not know whether the Minister has had any contact with his counterparts since the Tories announced their budget, in which they cut the block grant to the Assembly by €1.5 billion. Based on the trajectory from the budget, there will be further cuts of €2.4 billion in the North, which will undermine any possibility of achieving a sustainable economy in the future and undermines the stability of one of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements in the Stormont Assembly. What steps has the Minister taken to specifically ensure the transfer of fiscal powers to the Assembly to allow it to deal in the future with crises of the type we have seen in recent months as a result of not having control over its own income or the ability to change welfare rates, which is done by diktat from Westminster?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_23">The Deputy will be aware that the Agreement also provides for the Northern Ireland Executive to consider whether devolution of other fiscal powers, including the aggregates levy, stamp duty and the landfill tax, would result in a clear economic or social benefit for Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">The recently published Stormont House implementation progress report notes that the options have been prepared to enable the finance Minister in Northern Ireland to bring a paper on the matter to the Executive. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that these are primarily strand one issues. It is clear Northern Ireland faces a most challenging budgetary situation. However, regardless of the contents of the UK budget which was published last week, the immediate task remains to find workable solutions to the immediate challenges under the constraints which currently apply and I beg the assistance of the Deputy's party at leadership level in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> It is important we have stability, sustainable finance and effective power sharing in Belfast. This is an important backdrop to any serious concerted approach over the coming years to address what is a most challenging budgetary situation within Northern Ireland. I stress, as I have already done so in this House, that I recognise the special and unique status of Northern Ireland in the context of its being a society emerging from conflict. If we are to move forward towards repairing the divisions of the past and building a prosperous future for all the people on this island, the matters of finances, budget and economic development are crucial to achieving that pursuit.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The Minister mentioned sustainable finance again. Has he asked his counterparts not to cut further the Northern Ireland Stormont Assembly block grant? If that is to continue, all the agreements will be undermined, because the funding is not available to go ahead with the changes required. It is a post-conflict situation. There is, as the Minister mentioned, a different society in the Six Counties which is more reliant in many ways on state investment than the rest of the island. The Minister, Westminster and all those who took part in all the agreements recognise the post-conflict situation in the North, yet the key part, the funding to the Assembly to carry out its duties, is being cut. The question remains. Has the Minister specifically asked his counterparts, when he met them, or has the Taoiseach specifically asked David Cameron, when he met him, not to cut the block grant to the Northern Ireland Stormont Assembly any further?</p>

            <p eId="para_27">In all my contacts with the Northern Ireland parties over recent months, I have underlined, and will continue to underline, the importance of finding workable solutions to the crucial issues, with particular reference, as stated by the Deputy, to budgetary and welfare issues. I point to the Stormont House Agreement as having the potential to benefit Northern Ireland across a wide range of issues and it must be implemented in its totality. I have already stated that, in my view, which is a view I have made clear on a number of occasions, there needs to be a recognition of the post-conflict society that is Northern Ireland. We need an element of creative thinking and resolute leadership, which elements are needed to overcome the challenges we now face. While we are heading towards the summer months and parliamentary recess, this small window of opportunity of the next few weeks must be used to ensure the political leaders in Northern Ireland, across all parties, face up to the responsibility, find a sustainable resolution to the issues at hand and intensify their efforts on advancing and progressing the Stormont House Agreement as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">Prison issues in Northern Ireland, in particular those affecting prisoners in separated accommodation, regularly feature in my discussions with Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, MLA, and, on non-devolved matters, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, MP. In my contacts, I emphasise the importance of building trust between separated prisoners and prison management in Maghaberry Prison. Trust has been damaged by the 2012 murder of prison officer David Black. The way forward will be through the implementation of the recommendations of the September 2014 Stocktake report of the independent assessment team, which reviewed progress in implementing the August 2010 agreement at Maghaberry Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The Northern Ireland Prison Service and prisoners are agreed on the importance of implementing the Stocktake report. The appointment of a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross as the new independent chair of the prison forum should assist progress in this regard. To date progress has not moved as quickly as anyone would wish. It is my understanding that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross have been actively consulting with all parties to the prison forum over recent weeks, including republican and loyalist prisoners as well as management in the prison to agree working methods.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> Strip-searching, controlled movement and detention in the care and supervision unit of Maghaberry Prison continue as points of difference and tension between prisoners and prison management. It is important to bear in mind that a balance is required to be found between vindicating the rights of prisoners in restrictive imprisonment with the duty on management to ensure that an environment is created where the health and safety of staff and inmates are protected. There are differences in emphasis between management and prisoners in where the balance lies. This is further complicated by the differing responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office in respect of these matters. To effectively address these issues it is important that progress is shown.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> My officials actively follow up with appropriate departments, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Prisoner Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and prisoners on these and other matters. I am aware that the independent chair of the prison forum is seized of the importance of these issues. I was pleased last week to have an opportunity to meet a group of interested Deputies on this issue. I would be happy to keep Deputy Wallace informed of developments in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">I am informed of the issues. The Minister referred to trust. If I was the principal of a secondary school and there was a breakdown and things were not working out, many people would be pointing the finger at the principal, at me. I see no serious willingness in this area. We have met the prisoners, the governor and assistant governors. I do not see an honest engagement from management side in the prison. What we have witnessed in recent years is frightening and it is deteriorating, not improving.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Previously, when we brought up this subject the Minister said that there had been assaults from republican prisoners on prison staff. That did not happen and the prison governor confirmed it. There have been no assaults. The only assaults that have taken place have been on prisoners, not on staff. There have been complaints of verbal disagreements between prisoners and staff, but that is normal even outside prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Controlled movement has been condemned and there is no logic in how those responsible are operating. They have disimproved things. There is strip-searching. Individuals who were brought to hospital never left the sight of security forces. They were strip-searched going out and strip-searched coming back, despite the fact that they were handcuffed to security personnel all the time. No one could possible justify it. There is an effort on the part of the management of the prison to humiliate the prisoners. It is illogical. There is a better way to deal with this. I am surprised that the Minister is not forcing the issue and putting pressure on those concerned to see common sense.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">It is in everybody's interest to advance matters. I invite the Deputy to agree with me that the recommendations made in the Stocktake report represent the way forward. The Northern Ireland Prison Service has accepted the recommendation made in the report that forum meetings take place at least once every two months with an agreed agenda. If there is an agreed agenda, the types of issue or individual grievance raised by the Deputy can best be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> In December 2014 Mr. Tom Miller was nominated as chairman of the prison forum. However, this nomination was not acceptable to republican prisoners. Following a process of consultation, prisoners and prison management have agreed to accept a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross to chair the forum. Nobody could contest the independence of an individual of that status. The decision of the individual to take on the chairmanship of the forum was not taken lightly. It followed a period of intense organisational reflection, including on how best to maintain the integrity and independence of the organisation while acting as chairman. It is important that everybody work together.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> I welcome the contribution of the Deputy but believe it is important that those concerned be in a position to move forward with the forum, the agenda items, the format of the agenda and the specific issues agreed in advance by both prisoners and prison management in order to deal with many of the grievances that persist.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">We, too, welcome the involvement of the Red Cross, but the terms of reference will be crucial. The question of whether the Red Cross individual will have the power to be a decision-maker is paramount.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> We have also met the Minister of Justice, Mr. Ford. Forgive us for feeling he is either unable or unwilling to implement his decisions on the ground. We have serious worries that there are people with a vested interest in trouble. We find it hard to get our heads around the fact that the recommendations made in the Stocktake report have not even been implemented properly. Those concerned have reneged on the controlled movement recommendation made in the report. There was supposed to be four and four, allowed to mix. There was three and three, allowed to mix. They went to four and four, but there was only a maximum of four allowed out at a time. It is actually a regression.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> We fear there that are people within the security forces in Northern Ireland who, perhaps because of the loss of overtime or jobs, seem to have a vested interest in trouble. They almost like to see trouble coming from the community in reaction to how the prisoners have been treated within the prison. What is happening is irrational. We are not remotely interested in any republican sympathies but actually believe what is occurring is troublesome and problematic. The Irish Government should play a stronger role in addressing the irrationality on the part of the management of Maghaberry Prison and the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">If there is any perceived delay in the implementation of the recommendations made in the Stocktake report, it is important that the issues be addressed. The report, produced by the independent assessment team, was transmitted to Minister Ford and representatives of the prison late last year. It clearly addresses a number of grievances and issues on which progress should be made. It has not been possible to realise the full potential of the Agreement, partly because of a lack of trust between the prison service and separated prisoners, as adverted to by the Deputy, and also because of understandable concerns about staff safety, particularly after the brutal murder of a prison officer, Mr. David Black. However, the report did make a number of recommendations, including on full body searching, freedom of movement, the format of prison forums, family visits and the provision of education. I am sure the Deputy will concede that these recommendations have been largely accepted by the Northern Ireland Prison Service. I accept that implementation has been slow, but it is my understanding that the intention is to address these matters. I welcome the independent chairman and look forward to seeing matters proceed at a rate that has not been evident heretofore.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">The Stormont House Agreement, which followed on from the Haass talks, is intended to bind the parties and communities closer together in resolving identity and legacy issues, coming to an agreement on welfare reform and making government finance in Northern Ireland more sustainable. Could the Minister outline the progress that is being made in respect of its implementation? We all welcomed the agreement in this House earlier this year and we want to see it implemented. The events of the past few days show that we need to have politics working to its full potential in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">I agree with Deputy Smith that the important issue currently is to ensure the full implementation of all aspects of the Stormont House Agreement. I mentioned in response to Deputy Ó Snodaigh that there are urgent and challenging issues relating to finance. There is a small window of opportunity in the course of the next few weeks which will provide the five party leaders and their parties with an opportunity to re-intensify their efforts because there is much at stake here. We are looking at the future workings of the institutions in Northern Ireland and at ensuring that the institutions are working for and on behalf of the people throughout Northern Ireland. I believe that there is so much at stake here that it is essential that all parties ensure that finding resolutions is a priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> As I outlined in an earlier reply, the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement remains a priority of this Government and continues to be a key focus in all its contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government at the highest level. Implementation of the agreement continues to be subject to ongoing review. The most recent review took place late last month. Notwithstanding the fact that July and August are months during which political engagement may not be at its highest, I believe it is important that contact remains throughout the summer months to ensure that all aspects of the agreement can facilitate the reporting of progress. The Government will continue to play its part in ensuring the full implementation of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_50">The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and I represented the Government at the most recent review meeting on 25 June, which considered and approved for publication a six-month progress report in accordance with the monitoring provisions of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> In respect of the issue of collusion, it is a matter of public record that collusion occurred during the Troubles between British state forces and paramilitaries. Successive Irish Governments in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government. We continue to do so, including in respect of a number of individual cases of longstanding concern such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the case of the late Pat Finucane. In particular, we advocate that all relevant documentation be made available to be examined by the appropriate mechanisms. Such cases must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events. I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases. For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government. We believe that these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles, including those affected by collusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> These institutions will include a historical investigations unit, HIU, to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR, to enable victims and survivors seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths. Good progress is being made on the establishment of these institutions which I believe will assist all victims, including the victims of collusion, in their quest for justice and the truth.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">I thank the Minister for his reply. Unfortunately, we witnessed hooliganism on our television screens last night. We saw the actions of a small minority determined to return to the bad old days. They must not and will not succeed. It is very important that this small band of extremists is marginalised so it is extremely important that we push the political process forward. I did not think we would again see 24 members of the police force and a 16 year old girl being injured on the streets of the second city of this island. We saw bottles and bricks being thrown, baton rounds and the water cannon. All of this type of activity should be consigned to history. It is extremely important that all aspects of the Stormont House Agreement are implemented in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> Could the Minister indicate whether it is possible to progress parts of the agreement? I presume that different sections and aspects of the agreement can be progressed when work is underway on other aspects. It is extremely important that a clear message goes out to society in general that it is politics that will win and bring about a better society and communities for everybody in all parts of this island.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I share the concern expressed by Deputy Smith and others about the incidents of violence last night on the streets of Belfast. It is important that the rule of law obtain and I am pleased to report this morning that a number of arrests have been made, charges have been laid and those people will be brought before the courts at the earliest opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">It is important we all use our collective effort and context to ensure we can influence society in Northern Ireland and, in particular, those who have not embraced the contents of the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and other agreements. It is only through our collective efforts and through implementation in the form of progress across a range of issues that we can have in Northern Ireland the type of political stability that is appropriate for certainty and for a stable and peaceful society. Notwithstanding the fact there is something of a logjam in parts of the agreement - I refer specifically to the issues of welfare, finance and budgets - I urge parties to use their best endeavours in a way that perhaps has not been evident over recent months. Other aspects of the agreement refer to the legacy of the past and to the unimplemented aspects of previous agreements, upon which we can make progress and upon which we in this jurisdiction can make progress, as we are doing, in drafting legislation dealing with the very sensitive, personal and very important issue of finding a new departure in respect of the issues of the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">I thank the Minister for his reply. Will he give an assurance that progress can and will be achieved in the area of establishing the truth in regard to collusion? In recent months we have witnessed excellent public service given by BBC and RTE in very good documentaries on collusion by British state forces with terrorist organisations in the North of Ireland and, indeed, also in the South. It is very important the truth is established with regard to the murder of many innocent people.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> I had the opportunity to mention on numerous occasions in this House the need for the British Government to respond without further delay to the unanimous request of this Parliament to give access to an eminent international jurist to all papers and files relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974. It is extremely important that the British Government indicates it will respond positively. The truth is the very least to be expected for the families of those who were murdered so callously in 1974 and also the families of victims of other atrocities. Those documentaries were really chilling. We all would have known about the individual incidents but it was really chilling and frightening when they were catalogued and put in a documentary to show that state forces were colluding with terrorists and many innocent people on this island were killed. I appeal to the Minister to continue to pursue with the British Government the need to release the papers relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and also to make progress with regard to a proper investigation into the bombings in Belturbet in 1972.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">Three decades of civil war in Sri Lanka, which ended in 2009, caused the internal displacement of tens of thousands of Sri Lankans, many of whom are members of the Tamil population. This remains an issue to the present day. There has been a change in government in Sri Lanka following the presidential election in January 2015, and I welcome the stated commitments by the new President to re-establish democracy, freedom, good governance and respect for human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> Our ambassador to Sri Lanka, who is based in New Delhi, maintains regular contact with the Sri Lankan authorities and regularly visits the area for discussions there. Our embassy in New Delhi monitors developments in Sri Lanka on an ongoing basis. Through the embassy, we are in regular contact with the EU delegation in Colombo which reports that the new government has already taken some positive steps to deal with resettlement issues, including returning some military land used for commercial purposes, the nomination of a civilian governor in the northern province, cancelling the foreign travel restrictions in the north and welcoming Tamil refugees from India.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> At the United Nations Human Rights Council session in March 2014, Ireland voted in favour of a resolution promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. One aspect of that resolution was a request for an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights, and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka. A report of that investigation is due to be presented at the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015. I and officials from my Department will closely monitor developments on this at the United Nations, and examine this report in detail on its publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union in Brussels on 9 February 2015, which I attended, the Council agreed a number of conclusions on European Union priorities at UN Human Rights Fora in 2015. With regard to Sri Lanka, the Council welcomed the commitments by the new government on rule of law and reconciliation, while encouraging the new government to work with the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council to address ongoing human rights concerns and make credible domestic progress on reconciliation. </p>

            <p eId="para_69"> A meeting of the EU-Sri Lanka joint commission took place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 2 April 2015. The joint commission, which oversees the EU-Sri Lanka Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development, which has been in place for 20 years, deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest. At this meeting it was agreed in principle to establish a new working group on governance, rule of law and human rights, to allow for a dialogue on these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_71"> In 2009 the Sri Lankan Government defeated the Tamils with much brutality. That brutality has continued since then through the occupation by 160,000 Sinhalese soldiers in the northern province which has only 1 million inhabitants. This shows that in some ways the war continues.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> Is the Minister aware that since the end of the war there have been widespread reports of violence, physical and sexual, against women by soldiers in some of the occupied areas and also throughout the rest of Sri Lanka, the destruction of Hindu temples and land grabs?</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I assure the Deputy that we are keeping a very close eye on the situation on the ground in Sri Lanka. We are very concerned at some of the instances of violence that persist. We are ensuring that not only we but also our colleagues in the European Union play a most active role in assisting in the very challenging and difficult situation that persists.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> As well as Ireland’s engagement at EU and UN level, Ireland provides funding to the situation in Sri Lanka. Under Irish Aid’s funding to non-governmental organisations, NGOs, just over €300,000 has been allocated in Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013. Included among those receiving funding is UPR Info, a civil society organisation based in Geneva which works to build the capacity of civil society organisations and to engage with the United Nations Human Rights Council’s universal periodic review process. Irish Aid funds missionary orders, through Misean Cara, which allocates funding through grants to missionary congregations for their development work in the region. Between 2012 and 2014, Irish missionaries working in Sri Lanka received almost €290,000 in Irish Aid funding which was disbursed through Misean Cara. I acknowledge the very strong and positive action taken by our NGOs and missionaries, often in difficult and challenging circumstances. I assure the Deputy that not only will we continue to keep a close eye on the situation but we will play our part in active engagement to ensure many of the problems in the area and region might be addressed positively.</p>

As he said, in September there will be an opportunity for Ireland and others on the Human Rights Council to examine a report on the investigation into the last years of the conflict, not what has happened since then. I hope he and the UN will be able to persuade the Sri Lankan Government to co-operate fully. The new government has to date not co-operated fully with the UN-mandated investigation. I hope the Minister will also take the opportunity of the September council meeting to confirm our support, and maybe our demand, for an international investigation, not the domestic one which Sri Lankan governments have looked for. Maybe at the very least there should be a hybrid domestic and international investigation, similar to that in Sierra Leone and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which managed to overcome government opposition to a perceived interference by international forces. Ireland should insist that there be an international component and that the UN should be one of those bodies if at all possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">An EU-Sri Lanka joint commission took place in Colombo on 2 April of this year. The joint commission, which oversees the EU-Sri Lanka co-operation agreement on partnership and development that has been in place for 20 years, deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest. Ireland and other member states received a request in June from the European Commission to nominate candidates for the positions of long-term and short-term observer for the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka. We are very much aware of the ongoing violence and the human rights violations and I assure the Deputy and the House that our mission in New Delhi, which is in close contact with the situation on the ground in Colombo and wider Sri Lanka, is not only keeping a close eye on the situation but is very much involved, along with our EU colleagues, in seeking a solution to a challenging and deeply worrying situation.</p>

How does the Minister respond to the allegation, made by the former Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, in the article in <i>New Statesman</i> published in the last day or two, that Ireland was one of what he described as the major opponents of the Greek Government in seeking a debt writedown and real relief from the austerity package the troika was trying to impose?</p>

            <p eId="para_81">To address the question as tabled by the Deputy, I have not spoken to the Minister, Mr. Kotzias, since the referendum was held in Greece on 5 July. The Deputy and the House will be aware that, following the referendum, Finance Ministers of the euro area member states and Heads of State or Government have met on numerous occasions. The leaders have agreed in principle that they are ready to commence negotiations on an ESM financial assistance programme for Greece.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> In response to what the Deputy has just said, the euro area has an obligation to Greece in these difficult times, but Greece also has an obligation to itself. It needs to reform its economy and return it to a measure of sustainable growth. I have not read the article to which the Deputy refers. However, Ireland, together with the other member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation being faced by the Greek people. That is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new government, while also respecting the commitments it has already entered into.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> Greece is a sovereign state. It is for it to decide whether it wishes to accept the financial aid offered by its European partners. It is in all of our interests that Greece remains firmly in the euro area. However, as a member of the euro area, each member state continues to have its obligations. It is no different for Greece. That is precisely why, following a request by the Greek authorities for a third programme under the ESM, leaders of the euro area member states have agreed in principle that they are ready to commence negotiations on an ESM financial assistance programme for Greece. For recovery of the Greek economy to take place, a number of difficult and challenging reforms have to be undertaken - these are inevitable. In that regard, we continue to urge the Greek authorities to keep to their commitments and legislate without delay for the first set of agreed trust-building measures which I understand will be under way in the Greek Parliament in the next 24 to 36 hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">The so-called bailout is conditional on the acceptance of further pension cuts, savage spending cuts, VAT increases, €50 billion worth of further privatisations, more repossessions of homes and foreclosures on small businesses. This is in a country in which the level of poverty has increased by 98%, the child mortality rate has increased by 42%, pensions have been slashed by 45% and salaries have been cut by 40%. How can the Minister and his friends in the troika honestly say the Greek people must take more pain when they are being crushed?</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> How does the Minister respond to the allegation from the former Greek finance Minister that Ireland, along with a few other countries, was foremost in insisting that Greece and its people must accept more vicious austerity or get no assistance from Europe? That is a shameful betrayal of people who have been crushed. Mr. Varoufakis says that the reason Ireland took this position was fear of political embarrassment if the Greek people got any relief on debt and austerity.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">I do not accept that Ireland has been placed in the position alleged by the Deputy. Ireland continues to have great sympathy for the people of Greece. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has expressed that view publicly on several occasions over the past few weeks, which have been a very challenging period. It has been reported directly that the Minister had been most helpful to the Greek authorities in moving to a position whereby negotiations of a realistic nature were taking place up until the end of June. Reports over the weekend show a similarly important role played by our Minister in ensuring that the talks and negotiations were kept on track. Ultimately, the reforms that are appropriate and necessary for a further bailout are a matter for the Greek Government and authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">Does the Minister not actually mean that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has assisted in what is effectively a coup d'état in Greece? There is a deliberate attempt by Chancellor Angela Merkel and the troika to split the Greek Government in order to ram more unconscionable austerity down the throats of people who are on their knees. Does the fact that there is going to be a general strike tomorrow not prove that Tsipras's Government, in its shameful capitulation, does not enjoy the support of the Greek people? They are on the streets yet again tomorrow because they cannot take it.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> Why has our Government sided with the euro bullies against the wishes and needs of the Greek people, instead of standing up for a Europe of democracy and solidarity? The European project as a notion of solidarity and co-operation is dead in the water. It has exposed itself now as a bullying, corporate, bank-dominated austerity juggernaut that cares nothing for democracy.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I do not accept that at all. The agreement concerns the matter of fundamentally rebuilding trust between the authorities in Greece and the 18 other member states of the euro area. In this regard, I urge the Greek authorities to keep their commitments and to legislate without delay - as I understand they are doing - on the first set of trust-building measures. It is important that this Parliament and other parliaments in the eurozone and the EU acknowledge a fact with which the Deputy seems to have a difficulty, namely that Greece is a sovereign state. It is for Greece to decide whether it wishes to accept the financial aid package offered by its European partners or take another course. There has always been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government. I note that the new Greek finance Minister has received no mention from Deputy Boyd Barrett. The Deputy was obviously very much a fan and supporter of his predecessor.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">Does the Minister not agree the Varoufakis interview confirms that and, as I put to the Taoiseach just two weeks ago, that it also confirms the Government’s actions were stabbing the Greek people in the chest and the Irish people in the back?</p>

            <p eId="para_93">This seems to be an echo of the identical type of question from Deputy Boyd Barrett. I have not held any discussions with my Greek counterpart or any Greek officials since the referendum was held in Greece on 5 July. The agreement reached on 13 July is not a new deal. Rather, it sets out the modalities for the conduct of negotiations with a view towards the reaching of agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> I will repeat what I said in response to Deputy Boyd Barrett. It is incumbent on the Greek authorities to recognise their need to proceed to legislate, which I am sure the sovereign parliament will do, on the matter of value added tax, pensions and reforms by 15 July, and a further set of reforms by the following week, 22 July. Only when and if that course of action is completed and passed and the legislation is enacted in the sovereign parliament in Athens can discussions on the new programme commence.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">That is yet another threat from the Minister, the same threats that have come from the Eurogroup, the Commission President and the President of the European Parliament. The Greek Government was negotiating under pressure with a gun to its head. It was told that if it did not agree to the horrific austerity that will destroy the Greek people and economy, it would be out of the eurozone and they would bring down its banking system. Where was the Minister for Finance during the process? He, along with Wolfgang Schäuble, was screaming that they should pull the trigger and pull the support from the Greek banks. The demands put on the Greek Government are to destroy and devastate the Greek economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> If Syriza votes for it as a whole, which the majority is likely to do, it will finish itself as a political force having sold out the people in terms of the basis on which they voted for it and that will bring an end to the government. I support those in the Greek Parliament who will vote “No”. I support those who will mobilise in the general strike to vote “No”, but let us be clear on the rotten role of the Government. This is not democracy. This is not a democratic European Union. Greece is not being treated as any sort of sovereign state. Europe has bullied Greece and more bullying is evident in the recent agreement which aims to humiliate and ensure no example exists of an alternative to austerity that could embarrass the Government or that of Prime Minister Rajoy in Spain, or that in Portugal or elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">I very much reject any assertion that Ireland, its Minister for Finance in particular, or anybody else for or on behalf of this country engaged in the type of behaviour alleged by Deputy Paul Murphy. The agreement is far from humiliating Greece or its people. It is about an attempt to rebuild trust between the Government of Greece on behalf of the people of Greece and the euro state governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> I understand that a course of action has already been embarked upon by the Greek Government within its Parliament to mark its commitments and proceed with a programme of legislative reform over the next few days. I stress for the benefit of Deputy Murphy that Greece is a sovereign state and it is for Greece itself to decide whether it wishes to accept the financial aid package offered by the European partners or seek an alternative route.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">This agreement is about the deliberate humiliation of the Greek people and the Greek Government. Some of the finance Ministers at the Eurogroup admitted it. They said the reason the agreement is so harsh is because the Greek people, through an incredible act of insubordination, had a democratic referendum and opted to reject austerity.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">As a result, the EU demanded more austerity. Does a sovereign state hand €50 billion worth of its assets to a supposedly independent fund? Does it hand over its assets to one that was originally proposed to be controlled by the German finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, making these presentations? Does a sovereign state agree to have automatic austerity and to cede power to an unelected fiscal council? This is about humiliation, a dictatorship of capital and the rich in Europe, and the Irish Government trying to avoid humiliation. Yanis Varoufakis said of other indebted countries:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_101">The reason of course was their greatest nightmare was our success: were we to succeed in negotiating a better deal for Greece, that would of course obliterate them politically, they would have to answer to their own people why they didn’t negotiate like we were doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">This was the dominant motivation of the Irish Government, which is willing to see Greek people starve and die as a result in order to enhance their political position.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">I acknowledge the very positive and helpful contribution by the Minister for Finance, particularly as the talks hit a critical stage over the last few days. While it is in all our interests that Greece remain in the euro area, each fully fledged member has, and will continue to have, obligations. This is no different for the Greek Government, and this is why, following a request on the part of the Greek authorities for a third programme under the ESM, leaders of the euro area member states have agreed in principle that they are ready and willing to commence negotiations on an ESM financial assistance programme for Greece as soon as the Greek authorities complete their programme of legislation and reform in order to facilitate the commencement of the negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">My Department has a very clear strategy in place focused on achieving a positive outcome at the earliest opportunity. The strategy is based on two clear objectives, namely, to see the individual released by the Egyptian authorities so he can return to his family and his studies here in Dublin, and to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. Over the past year, I have engaged intensively with the Egyptian authorities, the EU and other international partners at a very high level on the case. I have spoken to my Egyptian counterpart directly on several occasions and raised concerns with him about the length of time our citizen has been in detention without trial or conviction. My officials are in ongoing contact with the Egyptian embassy in Dublin and the Egyptian authorities in Cairo. At the hearing on 3 June, which was attended by Irish officials, a number of defence lawyers requested that no further hearings would take place during the Ramadan period. The judge agreed to this and scheduled the next hearing for 2 August, at which embassy officials will also be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> The Taoiseach and I last met the individual's family on 4 June in Dublin. At that meeting, we were informed that he had indicated he was considering embarking on a hunger strike. Noting that his welfare was of paramount concern we advised against this course of action, saying it was unlikely to serve any positive purpose in his trial and would be detrimental to his health. Embassy officials visited our citizen last week. During this visit, he informed the officials that he had relaxed his hunger strike somewhat, and it would appear that he is taking fluids and some food. This is a welcome development.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> There is no doubt that prisons abroad can be places of fear and intimidation for Irish citizens, and this creates stress and anxiety for the citizens and their families. The welfare of any Irish citizen imprisoned abroad is a matter taken extremely seriously by the Government. Where allegations of mistreatment have been made, my Department has taken the appropriate action. While our citizen remains in detention, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing everything it can to protect his welfare, and to ensure prison conditions for him are as good as they can be. Since his arrest in August 2013, the citizen has been visited a total of 42 times by embassy officials. This unprecedented level of consular visitation indicates clearly the priority we continue to place on doing all we can to monitor carefully his welfare in detention, and to advocate strongly on his behalf to the Egyptian authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">While I appreciate the consular assistance, the problem is that Mr. Halawa is still in prison, almost two years on. Is it time to try a different strategy than that of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? Is it not time for the Taoiseach to intervene, as Australian and Canadian Heads of State did in the cases of Peter Greste and Mohamed Fahmy, respectively, who were consequently released? Could the Minister respond to the suggestion by a human rights lawyer that he was not aware of any formal support by the Irish Government of a request by lawyers in Cairo for the release of Mr. Halawa under a presidential decree? Could the Minister confirm that the Government has sent a formal note of support, or other appropriate means of communication, for the request? Could the Minister respond to the recent allegation by the human rights lawyer, Gráinne Mellon, that Mr. Halawa had been a victim of multiple beatings using whips, chains and sticks while in prison?</p>

            <p eId="para_110">The Government takes any allegations of ill treatment or mistreatment very seriously and will ensure these issues are raised at the highest level. We continue to maintain extensive contacts with the Egyptian authorities and other international partners through the EU and beyond, many of which have had citizens in similar circumstances. On examining other similar cases, it remains very clear that, irrespective of political efforts made by foreign governments, including high-level requests, the other trials were completed before any political consideration of a possible release by the Egyptian authorities took place. The trial of the individual mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy is ongoing. While we continue to maintain extensive contacts with the Egyptian authorities, including at very high levels, the precedents suggest it is unrealistic to expect any release until the initial trial takes place and is concluded. It is the Government's considered approach-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_124">Last week I asked some questions about the sale of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA’s Northern Ireland loan book to Cerberus, the circumstances surrounding it and the need for a commission of investigation to examine it. Prior to that, we had tabled several questions on the issue to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. We note that representatives of NAMA appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week on the sale of these assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> There was a policy drive to accelerate the sale of NAMA’s loan books in this country and elsewhere in six months, as in the case of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC. The Minister for Finance made these comments at an Oireachtas committee and suggested it to NAMA. Apart from this, it emerges that he knew from March 2014 that a former NAMA adviser, Mr. Frank Cushnahan, was to be paid in a three-way split of a £15 million fee between him and two solicitors firms for the sale of the Northern loan book to Pimco, the first company which had come along looking for a closed deal with NAMA. We also note that there seems to have been significant interaction between Northern politicians and Pimco, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Northern Ireland First Minister, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and NAMA. For example, the principal private secretary to the Northern Ireland First Minister sent a copy of the memorandum of understanding between the Northern Ireland Executive and Pimco to the Minister for Finance who properly sent it back to them, saying they should deal with NAMA. </p>
          <p eId="para_126"> The fundamental question is did it not strike anybody, including the Minister for Finance, that a former adviser who had resigned some months earlier from the Northern Ireland advisory committee to NAMA was involved in doing the biggest property deal on the island of Ireland with the very company that was going to buy it.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">Did it occur to anybody that the entire process should be withdrawn and that the deal should be pulled back from? One month later it was sold on to Cerberus following a competitive bid. The bottom line, however, is that the same two legal firms were involved. What happened after the sale? We learned about an offshore account in which £7 million had been placed. We learned that a senior partner in one of the legal firms involved was no longer with that firm. The matter was then reported to the Law Society of Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">From March this year, everybody else has been in the dark about this. The Minister did not alert anybody here that there were serious issues surrounding the sale of the Northern Ireland loan book. By any definition, it was a serious issue that such a senior adviser to NAMA on the Northern Ireland loan book and who was on NAMA’s Northern Ireland advisory committee was subsequently playing a central role in doing the deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">There are also concerns about the interaction between the Northern Ireland Executive and NAMA. The Minister for Finance had five contacts, namely, three meetings and two telephone calls, with Northern Ireland politicians on the sale of the NAMA loan book. That is separate from the biannual meetings between Northern Ministers and their counterparts in the Republic. This is a concern, bearing in mind that the original legislative template for NAMA rules out any involvement of politicians in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">Is the Taoiseach not concerned about this? Why was it that, when the Minister for Finance was informed of this serious development with NAMA ,that the entire sales process was not withdrawn?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_69">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_135">The Deputy has raised several issues which have been commented on in the public for the past period. It is important to bear in mind that there are two jurisdictions involved. What he is talking about in respect of the issue in Northern Ireland is being examined by the Law Society of Northern Ireland while the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom has recently confirmed that it is investigating allegations of corruption. The Minister for Finance and NAMA have welcomed these investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> The Deputy is well aware that the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General’s office are the accountable bodies for NAMA. They should be allowed to investigate any issue that arises. Last week personnel from NAMA were before the Committee of Public Accounts which is chaired by Deputy John McGuinness, at which they issued statements and answered questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> The Northern Ireland portfolio was sold for €1.5 billion because that was what the properties securing loans were worth. The original amount was €5.7 billion, lent by the banks prior to NAMA’s establishment, but it had no relevance to the current value of the underlying property security. The Minister for Finance has outlined the chronology of what happened. When it was brought to his attention in respect of a company called Pimco, it obviously withdrew because he saw that it did not go any further. This matter is being investigated by the Northern Ireland Assembly’s finance committee. Both the Law Society of Northern Ireland and the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom are investigating allegations of corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> In so far as NAMA is concerned, the procedures and chronology have been outlined by the NAMA personnel who attended the Committee of Public Accounts last week. As the Deputy is also aware, there are personnel from the Comptroller and Auditor General’s office on the board of NAMA with access to all of the papers and documentation. Their responsibility is to audit the accounts. They have issued four reports so far which have been deemed to be positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> Regarding the National Crime Agency's investigation in the United Kingdom, the only potential illegal activity of which we are aware is the diversion of funds due to a Northern Ireland law firm. The allegations raised in the House by Deputies are being taken very seriously by the authorities best placed to investigate them. The Northern Ireland firm in question, Tughans, has referred the alleged diversion of funds by one of its partners to the Law Society of Northern Ireland for investigation. The National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom has confirmed that it is to investigate the allegations of corruption. This specialised force has a national and international reach, with a mandate and powers to work in partnership with other law enforcement organisations to tackle organised and economic crime. The Minister for Finance and NAMA have welcomed this investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> NAMA has a remit, namely, to get the best value for the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Its remit has been expedited in that quite a deal of the properties that were in its portfolio have been moved on.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> The fact is there are no claims of wrongdoing against NAMA. They paid no moneys to and had no relationship with any party on this particular loan sale against whom any allegations of wrongdoings are now being made and the portfolio was sold following the open process to the highest bidder for what it was worth.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_143">I asked the Taoiseach last week would he set up a commission of investigation, and he said, "No". The Committee of Public Accounts would be the job, he said. There is a significant difference between the UK's National Crime Agency and the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of capacity, power, expertise etc. What is dramatic is the contrast between how the UK authorities are approaching this and how the Taoiseach and the Government are approaching it. It is quite a dramatic contrast in terms of the respective responses from the two jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Second, it is about ethics and whether the deal is done ethically. NAMA seems to be saying if everything is okay on the seller's side, it is not really responsible or too bothered about what happens on the purchaser's side. It satisfies NAMA that it got the best value for money, so the agency thinks. I would submit to the Taoiseach that it is equally important that we all, including NAMA, are satisfied that a deal is ethically completed, and one gets concerned when one learns, as NAMA and the Minister learned, that one's former adviser is about to get a substantial sum for assisting in closing the sale of the largest property deal on this island. As members of the committee stated last week, it is shocking.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">No one batted an eyelid. It seems neither the Minister nor NAMA batted an eyelid other than to safeguard themselves, to tick the boxes and to get the assurances, notwithstanding that it is the same legal firms involved, and lo and behold, we all are surprised afterwards when other material emerges. It is not good enough. It is an extraordinary error, at the minimum, of judgment, that the deal was allowed to go ahead and the sale of the entire northern loan book was allowed to proceed in the knowledge of what was going on in terms of involving people involved in advising NAMA a short period before they resigned. It was only in the preceding September that the individual resigned.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">For the purposes of clarity, there are, of course, two jurisdictions currently on this island but there is one NAMA. The person who is answerable in the final instance for the behaviour of that State agency is not the Comptroller and Auditor General but, in fact, the Minister for Finance. Second, the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have staff or personnel on the board of NAMA, as the Taoiseach asserted a few moments ago. Finally, NAMA has refused to appear before the finance committee in the North to which the Taoiseach referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> As with each scandal that unfolds on the Taoiseach's watch, the scale of what is going on in the secret world of NAMA is only slowly, piece-by-piece emerging into the light. No information has surfaced through any action or admission by the Government or its agencies. For instance, the £15 million kickback for fixers involved in the original sales process for the Northern book were only brought to NAMA's attention by a potential US buyer, Pimco. One proposed recipient of this kickback was Mr. Frank Cushnahan who, incredibly, had been a member of NAMA's northern advisory committee and appointed by the Minister. NAMA chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, told the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member that he briefed the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in full on this scandal, including the size of the proposed payment of £15 million. The question has already been asked, but not answered, as to why Deputy Noonan did not at that point suspend the sales process. There is a further question as to why the Minister did not inform the Executive of this turn of events and the pollution of the sales process.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Mr. Daly also says that NAMA was fully aware that the Belfast solicitors, Tughans, who by the way had a close relationship with Mr. Cushnahan, also acted for NAMA debtors.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Imagine - they were potentially on two sides of a transaction. Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil whether Tughans acted for debtors on the Northern loan book? </p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Perhaps the most breathtaking aspect was the revelation over the weekend that Mr. Frank Cushnahan was a NAMA debtor when appointed to the Northern Ireland advisory committee. Will the Taoiseach comment on this? NAMA's chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, did not give this piece of information when he appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts. Was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, aware of this fact? </p>
          <p eId="para_200"> In the light of these glaring questions and to ensure the interests of taxpayers are fully served, will the Taoiseach establish a commission of inquiry into the management and operation of NAMA?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_120">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_201">I wish to clarify what I said about the personnel from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I think I said they served on the board of NAMA, but that is not true. They are part of the NAMA company from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General but not board members.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The Deputy asked about what she called the "kickback". When the compliance section of Pimco brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance the fact that there was a proposed reference to a fee in the documentation, an end was put to Pimco's involvement forthwith. The sale was not pulled because there were other potential buyers interested in the loan portfolio in Northern Ireland. I do not have details of for whom Tughans acted. </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The Deputy also asked about a former board member, but the legislation regarding NAMA allows for recommendations to be made of people who might be able to serve on the board. I understand a number of names were put forward as recommendations. </p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy John McGuinness, has every right to recall personnel from NAMA to ask them further questions on any new information which comes to light. I have heard no accusation or allegation being made against anybody down here or against NAMA. As I confirmed in my reply to Deputy Micheál Martin, no payments were made by NAMA to the people referred to. I am quite sure the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts will reflect on any new information that has been brought to light and call back the personnel from NAMA to find out the answers to the questions raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> As I said to Deputy Micheál Martin, commissions of investigation operate only within this jurisdiction. The crime agency in the United Kingdom which has a different remit is investigating allegations of corruption. Some of the points raised by the Deputy will doubtless be the focus of its attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">The primary focus of the criminal investigation in the North is on a subsequent sum of money, £7 million, which found its way into a bank account on the Isle of Man. Primary responsibility for the democratic oversight of NAMA is vested in the Oireachtas, the Government and the Minister for Finance. I will put a couple of allegations, or assertions, on the table for the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">Pimco flatly contradicts the account given by Mr.. Frank Daly and insinuated by the Taoiseach that it was asked to withdraw from the sales process. It suggests it withdrew voluntarily. In the emerging scenario the Minister and NAMA know that things have gone very badly awry, yet, not only do they not inform the Northern Executive or pull the sales process, they are quite happy to allow things to trundle on. That is how the facts stack up. Facts are also emerging that specific law firms were acting for both bidders and NAMA debtors at the same time.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">Yes. Are we supposed to believe this was an isolated incident or that this turn of events, this web of relationships, the bad governance and the Minister for Finance asleep at the wheel was limited to Project Eagle? Are we asked to believe this? I believe the credibility of NAMA is on the line, particularly when one considers that some €13 billion worth of assets are on the market or are to come on the market in the near future. How is the public to have any confidence in the workings of NAMA or Government oversight of the agency, given this scenario? That is the reason a commission of inquiry is necessary. The Taoiseach could save us all a lot of heartache by not taking the long scenic route but by facing up to this issue and instigating a commission of inquiry.</p>

It is not the first time she has made comments and followed them by saying if anybody has evidence of illegality or criminality, he or she should bring it to the attention of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. She asks if we are expected to believe the activities of NAMA in this matter were legal. If she is insinuating that they are illegal, I advise her to bring such an accusation before the PSNI. She commented on the difference of opinion between Mr. Daly and Pimco. I expect the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy John McGuinness, to follow it up.</p>

He then told us the purpose of Leaders' Questions was to tell us where to go. That was all before he declared himself to be a long-time supporter of the idea that Dáil questions should be answered as fully and completely as possible. As he presumably knows, Deputy Ruth Coppinger and I duly toddled along to the audiovisual room to ask Irish Water the questions raised. We were told by it that it would not be "helpful" giving us the figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Following that I submitted a freedom of information request which was rejected on the grounds of commercial sensitivity by Irish Water, which is a monopoly. I appealed the refusal and got the same response. Approximately one month ago, when the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, was standing in for the Taoiseach, I asked the question again. Instead of getting any answers, I got a cut-price advertisement for Irish Water, which I could have got by turning on any radio station at almost any time of the day. The Minister did say, however, that we should direct our questions to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly. In fact, Deputy Ruth Coppinger had submitted a written question for the next day to the Minister, Deputy Kelly, which was ruled out of order. That is six different ways, which started more than two months ago with a question to the Taoiseach, we have tried to get those figures. It is quite a saga to get very simple information.</p>

For one, many people can reasonably guess and surmise that what is being hidden is a very low level of payment, especially given that 30% of people have still not registered, despite the Taoiseach's promise of a free €100, which was stolen from lone parents, to get people to sign up. Irish Water was happy to give that information without any scruples about disclosing commercially sensitive information.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I will repeat the two questions. Has the Cabinet discussed the payment levels of the water charges? It is a simple question and I would like the Taoiseach not to evade it. The Taoiseach told me more than two months ago to go to Irish Water, where we would get the information. He said, "I am sure Irish Water will be happy to supply the Deputy with the details of bills that have been issued and paid". More than two months later I am asking him, being, as Taoiseach, democratically accountable to this House, to provide this information.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> It is a simple request and an important one in the context of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill, which has been exposed as nothing more than a Government scare tactic, being all bark with no bite. There will be no direct deductions from people's income for water charges. Two court cases will be necessary to get payment for water charges from people, the first of which cannot be taken until a bill of more than €500 has been racked up, meaning there will be no cases until the end of 2017. We need to have the figures so we can have a discussion on them. Will the Taoiseach answer the questions, given he is responsible to the Dáil?</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_154">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_243">My decision last year to appoint Deputy Jimmy Deenihan as Ireland's first Minister of State for diaspora affairs points to the particular importance the Government attaches to engagement with those who left Ireland and with those of Irish heritage globally. When the Government published Ireland's first ever diaspora policy in March of this year, I stressed the importance of our diaspora to this nation and acknowledged that their existence is the end result of a long history of emigration, which for many was not considered a matter of choice. In the early part of this century we saw an end to this pattern of emigration but with the economic crash of 2008 our people, and particularly our young people, were deprived of the jobs and opportunities at home that they deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> From the beginning of its term of office, this Government's policy has been to create the economic conditions necessary to make returning to Ireland an option for those who have emigrated and who might now wish to return. The difficult decisions that we took and the key strategies that we have implemented, such as the Action Plan for Jobs, have got us back on track and our economy firmly in recovery. The credit for that lies with the people and the sacrifices they made to put the economy back on a strong footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> As we set out in our Spring Economic Statement, the Government's strategy of steady, stable economic growth will benefit all of our citizens and it will entice emigrants to return home. Opportunities are being created here for our people and we want them to be able to come home. The Action Plan for Jobs launched by the Government is a key instrument used to support job creation and further improve the environment for doing business in this country. Under it, more than 900 separate actions have been implemented since we started the process and this year there will be a further 300 or so. As a consequence of all of that and an improving environment, 100,000 new jobs have been filled.</p>
            <p eId="para_246"> Now that is happening, the Government has a particular focus on ensuring the benefits of that recovery are shared across the country because people point to this on a regular basis, including in the regions where we have seen a higher rate of unemployment and emigration. We are following the national Action Plan for Jobs by rolling out eight regional action plans as part of a €250 million programme to support business and job creation. These regional plans will identify and build on the strengths and resources that each of our regions possesses, but we need to focus on what they are. I was in Tullamore recently where action taken in the midlands spans such activities as establishing a manufacturing technologies campus to creating new hospitality facilities in respect of cycling, walking and recreational trails that exploit the waterways of the region. In the south west, key sectors targeted include agrifood, tourism, life sciences, manufacturing and ICT as well as high-potential emerging sectors, such as multi-media.</p>
            <p eId="para_247"> A number of other key actions taken this year include a national talent drive, which will attract and retain world class talent to address skills shortages that exist in the economy, including in the area of ICT. There has been a focus on entrepreneurship, which is aimed at attracting back to Ireland young innovators and entrepreneurs who wish to build their new businesses from an Irish base. There has been a continued implementation of the Construction 2020 programme to deliver a dynamic, competitive and sustainable construction sector, thereby providing good employment opportunities, including opportunities for the many construction workers forced to find work in other countries during the recession.</p>
            <p eId="para_248"> There has also been a programme of investment in research and innovation through Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council, Enterprise Ireland and others to attract highly skilled researchers to take up opportunities in a number of large industry co-funded research centres, thereby providing new opportunities for Irish researchers working abroad to return to this country. In addition, Enterprise Ireland, as I have often said, stands ready to support all entrepreneurs and innovators, including those living abroad, to establish ventures in Ireland and through IDA Ireland and the Succeed in Ireland initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">Irish people who have established businesses abroad and wish to locate their activities in Ireland will be actively encouraged and facilitated.</p>
            <p eId="para_250"> The first Irish diaspora policy, Global Irish, put in place a range of initiatives to improve how we connect with our people abroad and promote opportunities for those who wish to come back. This has been a particular focus of attention for the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan. A key challenge in this area is to ensure we provide clear and targeted communications that will ensure our emigrants are kept up to date on the opportunities available or those becoming available back at home. A number of initiatives are under way to help, for example, the new website <i>www.dfa.ie/Global-Irish</i> was launched in conjunction with the policy. It includes a section on coming home, providing pointers to practical information that anyone considering such a move might need. The Irish abroad are encouraged to sign up for a new Global Irish newsletter on this site and stay in touch using social media, through which messages about the economy and opportunities will be referenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_251"> The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, has consulted organisations like Enterprise Ireland, American Chamber of Commerce Ireland and others interested in bringing members of the diaspora home to take up opportunities. The Minister of State also chairs the interdepartmental committee, whose function is to support the delivery of the diaspora policy. This committee provides a forum to discuss any barriers to emigrants considering a return to Ireland as well as ways to address these challenges wherever possible. The committee met recently and discussed ways of encouraging emigrants to return to Ireland. The committee highlighted some of these potential barriers and will continue to look at ways in which they might be addressed. Members may have ideas or initiatives for consideration and these would certainly be considered by Government.</p>

          <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_155">
            <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_252">The Taoiseach knows how to throw plenty of buzzwords into his long speeches, and there were plenty in that intervention. We are hearing about entrepreneurship, Construction 2020 and a so-called national talent drive - I am a little unsure what that is or what it means. There were multiple references to research and development and innovation and so on. The reality is that the Taoiseach has a habit of making vague aspirational statements. Some months ago, he committed to undertaking specific steps to encourage young people who have emigrated in recent years to come back to Ireland. Many of them are from my generation. Many are young teachers, nurses, doctors or people who had aspirations to work or were working in the construction sector when the bottom fell out of that market. There are multiple factors contributing to the fact that young people - those of my generation and younger - are not returning to our shores in big numbers. Low graduate pay for young new entrants into particular professions is a significant factor. Recently, the Taoiseach and the Government were engaged in secret negotiations with the trade unions to agree so-called pay restoration for members of the public service. What the Taoiseach did not prioritise was the case of those who have taken the biggest hit and who have been hung out to dry by their representative bodies and successive governments in the past seven or eight years. They include young teachers, young nurses and non-consultant hospital doctors, many of whom are now in Australia, Canada and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_253"> The issue of housing is a serious concern. In Dublin, in particular, there is no housing supply. The Government's plan, devised in conjunction with Mr. Parlon and the Construction Industry Federation, aptly named Construction 2020, has little to do with providing housing for our citizens. It is failing and will fail because it is not about ensuring a quality supply of affordable housing. One egregious disgrace was the letter sent by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the relevant Minister of State some weeks ago demanding that building regulations be relaxed and taking the view that this is somehow going to translate into the provision of housing in Dublin or throughout the country for our young people. It is not. It is going to reduce quality and ensure that we have poor standards of housing. It will do nothing to deal with the problem of supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_254"> Another issue of significant concern for the younger generation is the fact that for a working couple or family to be able to continue working and have a family and children, they have to pay for child care. Child care is now on a par with paying for a mortgage in this country. The Government has done nothing to address this, despite promises from both Government parties when in opposition. I realise that the Taoiseach's former colleague in Cabinet, the former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said that this was the sort of thing people do in political parties - they make promises in opposition and then get into government and do not deliver on them. That has certainly been the case with regard to child care. Nothing has happened. Child care in Dublin is now averaging well over €1,000 per month. That is on a par with the cost of meeting mortgage payments. It is becoming prohibitive and is one of the major factors which acts as a disincentive to younger people from coming home.</p>
            <p eId="para_255"> There are no proposals on the table in respect of tax breaks for child care or the roll-out of community child care provision, nothing whatsoever. All of these contribute to the disincentives for the younger generation returning to our shores, the talent the Taoiseach has spoken about. If there is to be a talent drive it should encourage people back and ensure that there is a sustainable lifestyle; that they can have their children; that they can raise their families in this country; that they can aspire to career progression; that they will be treated fairly; and that they will not be squeezed at the mercy of a government which wants to buy off particular sectors in our society in the run-up to an election, or by trade unions which want to look after particular sectors of their membership. Rather, the interests of our citizens, abroad and at home, should be prioritised and should be the core guiding principle for this Government and any future government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_156">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_256">The Deputy mentioned buzzwords. She referred to entrepreneurship, construction and talent drive. The jobs of the future are going to be created by people of initiative who are prepared to invest and who have the confidence to invest. We cannot do that unless we have stability in an economy where there is the opportunity to be able to invest in business and create jobs. They tell us that 50% of the jobs to be created in the next decade will be in companies that have not been set up yet and which will trade products that have not even been conceived. That is why we have the national Action Plan for Jobs, which is proving successful. The fact that jobs are being created and numbers expanded by firms speaks to a new level of confidence. The consumer confidence index, for what it is worth, shows that consumer confidence is now the highest it has been for nine years. Clearly, with interest rates having fallen from unprecedented heights, ease of access to credit, the removal of a good deal of red tape and the setting up of local enterprise boards in every local authority, it is easier to create business, set up companies and employ.</p>
            <p eId="para_257"> How is that focused on the young Irish who have left? I have met many of them myself. For example <i>jobsireland.ie</i> is a fully searchable jobs board run by the Department of Social Protection. It allows employers to add their vacancies and jobseekers to search by a range of criteria. Young people worldwide are accessing this on a regular basis. The website <i>itshappeninghere.ie is</i> run by the Irish indigenous software sector and supported by Enterprise Ireland. It serves to help promote career opportunities in Irish-owned software companies. The website <i>gradireland.com</i> is Ireland's official graduate jobs and careers website and is run by the Association of Higher Education Careers Services and GTI Ireland. The <i>#allaboutjobs</i> section on the Government's news website <i>merrionstreet.ie</i> is accessed on a regular basis by young people. It captures the latest information available about new jobs being created as well as new opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_258"> The Deputy referred to construction and a talent drive. We lost 100,000 jobs in the construction sector here.</p>
            <p eId="para_259">Those affected went to America, England and Australia, as they did before. A couple of weeks ago I was talking to representatives of a firm that was bringing back civil engineers from New Caledonia, beyond Australia, to work on road projects here. I was talking recently to a young employee in a company beyond Sandyford who had returned from Australia having lived there for ten years. Last year I spoke to 100 young people in the United States, 50 of whom are coming home because they want to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_260"> Let us consider Deputy Lucinda Creighton's comment on the talent drive. This means that as the frontiers ahead are changing rapidly, companies are looking for very particular skills. The job requirements now outlined are vastly different from those outlined five or ten years ago and completely different from what they were 20 years ago. When one speaks to innovative companies based in Ireland, they always remark on the capacity of young Irish people to meet the challenge and have the bar set higher continually. That is why I am so proud of the young people working in plants all over the country. Many of them have come back from abroad with added experience, adding immeasurably both to the reputation of their company and the success of their own careers.</p>
            <p eId="para_261"> We make no apology for having a talent drive. It is very important. Bearing in mind the presence of Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, I draw attention to the new Apprenticeship Council which is determining where new apprenticeships need to be offered. While there will always be a need for traditional apprenticeships, there will be a need for digital apprenticeships and so many others, including in financial services and other changing sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_262"> The best thing the Government, or any government, can do is provide jobs at home for young people in order that they may have an opportunity to come back home to do work in which they are interested. This means that some of the other matters to which the Deputy referred must be dealt with. Clearly, the taxation system is one. Levels of tax are very high here by comparison with those in some other places. I noticed the changes made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer across the water in respect of becoming more competitive. However, one cannot address all of these issues unless one has a functioning economy that is driving the capacity of the country to do what we know has to be done. I say this in the context of our having had to borrow €22 billion just a few years ago to run the services of the country. This figure has fallen to €5 billion or less and will be eliminated by the end of 2017. It is important in this regard that 500,000 lower paid workers will not have any requirement to pay universal social charge this year. We set out the strategy for the path ahead in the spring statement. It might not be of any great interest to young people, but what they want to know is whether there are jobs available, the opportunities available and whether it is time for them to come home.</p>
            <p eId="para_263"> Everybody agrees that we are way behind in the supply of houses. That is because the construction sector collapsed completely during the recession, with 100,000 jobs lost. The Government has responded by offering local authorities a real programme for social housing worth €2.2 billion. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, made that announcement. There is a real focus on trying to get the private construction sector and local authorities to invest in the housing programme, which is so important for young people and others in the State. No one wants to see a continuing increase in the number required to be in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms because of increasing rents. That is not appropriate. The focus of the Government has been very much on that issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> I reject the Deputy's assertion that there are secret deals involving the public service. The Deputy, as a public representative, is well aware of the contribution made by the public service and its very many employees in playing their part in meeting the challenge in moving the country forward. As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, set out clearly, putting in place the Haddington Road agreement in the first instance was very difficult in gaining the acceptance of the trade unions. Obviously, the Government was intent, in respect of the flexibility on offer economically, on beginning to give back what could be given back to members of the public service who had played their part.</p>
            <p eId="para_265"> The Deputy mentioned nurses. Clearly, young nurses have travelled abroad in considerable numbers. I spoke to three recently. One was moving to Australia, one to America, while one was staying here. When I asked the two young women who were proposing to move abroad about their intentions, one said she was going to work in a hospital in a location in America where she had a close relation, while the other said she was moving to Australia because she wanted to travel for a couple of years and work. The third was quite happy to work in a local hospital. An incentive is being made available by the HSE and the Department of Health in order that young Irish trained nurses of exceptional calibre can stay at home and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> I referred to the national action plan for jobs. However, it is important to say also that we established the national Health Innovation Hub. It is located in County Cork and operating on a pilot basis to facilitate clinicians in hospitals, health care companies, researchers and other innovators to work together for the benefit of patients in the health care system. Over 1,000 trading online vouchers have been given to micro-businesses and small businesses to support them in increasing their number of employees, some of whom will be from abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_269">I thank the Deputy. On Thursday I met representatives of an Italian company that has formed a partnership with a medical devices company in Ireland which is able to employ people here. Owing to the nature of the research and innovation, opportunities have been provided for some people to come back home. Obviously, the services of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland are available to small and medium enterprises to increase their numbers also. As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Finance got rid of the double Irish concept in the last budget and, having closed the public consultation process, is now in the business of providing a knowledge development box that I hope will be of interest to companies from abroad in order that they can continue to invest here.</p>
            <p eId="para_270"> I would like to believe an increasing number of Irish citizens will want to come home, but the conditions have to be right for them in terms of their salaries, taxation and accommodation. These are necessary for everybody, including those at home and those who might want to come back.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> I meant to say to the Deputy that not everybody returning to Ireland was returning for work. Many Irish people return to avail of the education system, particularly at third level. In March 2014 the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, announced that children of Irish emigrants who had spent five years in primary or post-primary school in Ireland would qualify for EU-level fees at Irish universities and third level institutions for undergraduate courses from 2014-15. This issue was brought to the attention of Members when I travelled to Brussels for committee or other meetings. The change has been made to facilitate those concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> As the economy begins to improve and companies create jobs, we need to set out the strategy and the picture for the coming years. They can be developed and strengthened in order that young people can have the option of coming back home, which they did not have in the past.</p>

            <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_273">The Taoiseach keeps mentioning entrepreneurship and job creation. Unfortunately, it is clear that he does not actually understand them. I sometimes wonder whether he or his Government has any understanding of how capital flows result in job creation. The only thing of substance the Government has done to try to direct the flow of capital in the economy in the past four years is to create a tax holiday for investors in the property sector. If one invested in commercial or retail property in recent years in Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere, one got a seven-year capital gains tax holiday. However, if one invests in productive sectors of the economy such as the technology sector or across the SME sector in which jobs are being or can and should be created, one pays capital gains tax at a rate of 33%.</p>
            <p eId="para_274">If the Government looked across the water to the UK and saw what George Osborne - a clever Chancellor of the Exchequer who understands market economics, job creation and the genuine concept of an entrepreneurial and innovative economy - has done, it would be mimicking what he has done. When I speak to people who want to invest capital in this country, they tell me that they are not bothered to do so because it does not pay. They are taking their capital and investing in job creation in London and elsewhere in the UK. That is a major problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> The Government's figures are incorrect and I would advise the Taoiseach to look at the CSO figures. Over the past three years, self-employed people in Ireland have started employing fewer people than they did back in 2012 or 2013. The number of self-employed people who are employing others has actually dropped. That is a statistical fact. The Taoiseach's notion that indigenous Irish businesses are creating jobs for others is a fallacy. It is not reality. I would love to hear how the Taoiseach intends to change that. Is he going to change our approach to capitals gains tax and incentives in investment in real job creation here and not just roll out the red carpet for FDI companies, which we know account for less than 15% of jobs across the economy? Will he put in place concrete measures to deliver a genuinely entrepreneurial economy in order that young people who want to come back and create businesses and jobs here can do so and will not be penalised and punished for it? Alternatively, is he going to continue burying his head in the sand, clapping himself on the back and doing nothing about it?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_160">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_276">I must point out to the Taoiseach that he keeps claiming credit for things in which he had no involvement. In his reply to Deputy Creighton's question, he said that the Government took difficult decisions. In fact, he opposed two thirds of all the actions of the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, in his budgets to correct the deficit. He opposed every one of them, suggested that there was an alternative approach and then tried to claim credit for it. The same is true of the Action Plan for Jobs. The OECD carried out an analysis and confirmed that no specific claims for job creation can be made for the plan but the Taoiseach makes the claims anyway.</p>
            <p eId="para_277"> I was very disappointed with the Taoiseach's reply because there is no flesh on the bone in terms of attracting people back from abroad. Let us take three areas where the Government has direct control in terms of the public service alone. Mention has been made of low graduate pay. I met a woman the other day whose daughter is completing her midwifery course. There is no job available for her. Agency staff are given priority over young nurses coming out of college. That is why that apart from trying to attract people back, students are continuing to emigrate because they do not see prospects in key careers like health and education. Let us take second level teachers. A student who has completed the HDip does not have employment prospects in second level education. I was involved in helping a person over the years who e-mailed me the other day to say that it has taken her 12 years to get a contract of indefinite duration - the CID, as it is known. This is not a permanent, full-time job. It is a contract of indefinite duration. There is a real crisis in attracting young people into second level teaching because of the slow pathways in terms of progression.</p>
            <p eId="para_278"> The Taoiseach spoke about a national talent drive. They are all election slogans. The return from abroad is an election slogan and the Taoiseach's replies confirm it. Did he read the recent letter from the leading scientists in the country in <i>The Irish Times</i>? In it, they stated that there is no career pathway for young researchers or scientists in this country. This has been stated by all the key researchers and by the Irish Federation of University Teachers. It is a critical issue. They cannot get mortgages. There is also the issue of low-hour contracts for people seeking employment in retail or elsewhere. They cannot get mortgages and car loans because they do not have any security of tenure and the requisite hours and pay to enable them to have a reasonable quality of life. These are the key structural issues in terms of how young people are dealt with in the employment market. It is a significant catalyst for young people to go abroad and seek work elsewhere where they can do far better. Examples would be Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The number of young teachers out there illustrates the point I am making. If the Taoiseach wants to bring people back, he needs to put flesh on the bone in terms of career pathways, quality of employment and terms and conditions for young graduates that are on a par with everybody else</p>

          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_161">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_279">In addition to all of that, the Taoiseach cited the issue of housing and accommodation as one of the core issues to be tackled to facilitate people's return. As he is aware, there is a housing crisis throughout the State, particularly in the city of Dublin. The Taoiseach is aware that more than 40,000 families are on Dublin City Council's housing waiting list and that Dublin City Council has been left some €18.5 million short in respect of resources required for its homelessness service. I previously raised this issue with the Taoiseach and made him aware of the fact that there had been correspondence to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on this matter from the mayor of Dublin, Críona Ní Dhálaigh. Not alone has she not had the courtesy of a response from the Minister, there has been no affirmative statement from Government to make it clear that this €18.5 million shortfall will be bridged and that the necessary resources will be provided to Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_280"> If the Government is not resourcing emergency interventions and is not prepared to resource home building and accommodation for the population we currently have, it has a major difficulty in attracting people home. There must be a reality check on this. It cannot simply be about slogans and a looming election. I doubt whether there is a family in the country that has not lost somebody to emigration over recent years. It is certainly the case in my family and it is the same across the board. Those who wish to come home need to be given every opportunity to do so, including dislodging bottlenecks in career pathways but also dealing with perhaps the most basic requirement for a returning emigrant, namely, a roof over his or her head.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_162">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_281">I listened to three contributions. Deputy Creighton accuses others of ignorance and of not understanding things. The question of capital gains tax is one for consideration by the Minister for Finance. In recent budgets, he has made a number of changes to the tax code to improve incentives for investment and job creation here. This issue, along with many others, will be considered by the Minister in respect of the preparation of the budget in October. Prior to that, there will be public consultation and discourse next week where the different sectors will have their say about what they think should be relevant in this budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> This Government will not put our country in hock. We have had enough of that. That is what caused the flight from the country, the economic catastrophe and the recession. Whatever decisions the Government makes, regardless of whether they are criticised by people, they will be based on securing the recovery for our people for the time ahead. We are not yet at the top of the hill. We still have some very difficult challenges ahead. For Government, it is a case of being able to give to people what we can but not in the way that was done before where money was borrowed with fantasy figures on the assumption that things would last the way the previous Government assumed they would.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> Capital gains tax will be considered by the Minister for Finance together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I am not sure whether Deputy Creighton moves throughout the country and talks to people in small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_284">The Deputy says we do not understand what these are about, but I beg to differ, with respect. We have spoken to those with young firms who are not just in the business of supplying the domestic market but who also export. One can see their confidence in the integrity of the product they manufacture, in the way they are able to win new markets abroad and in the research undertaken by their talented workforce. The fact of an improving environment is evidenced by the reduction in unemployment from 15% to under 10% and by the reduction in interest rates which have fallen dramatically. It is evidenced by the fact our country was in a position to offer 30-year bonds at unprecedentedly low rates just a short time ago. The Minister of State, Deputy English, has arranged for a gathering of start-up companies to be held this October at which people from all over the world can either tune in online or be there, in order to have the very best of advice about start-ups and how they might access opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_285"> I have said on a number of occasions that the Government will start the process in this budget of dealing with PRSI for self-employed people. This has been a bone of contention for quite some time. This will be done over a number of years. It is important not to forget it is not possible to provide all the facilities that people need unless the country has a functioning economy that is able to deal with that. Our challenge is to secure the recovery for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_286"> Deputy Martin often says that the Government always claims credit for progress made. Has he ever heard me say that? It is the philosophy of fools in politics to look for credit. Deputy Martin knows that. We do not deserve it and neither do we claim it nor look for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_288">I will clarify it for Deputy Martin. It is the people who make the sacrifices here and they know that our country is in a different place now because jobs are being created every day by people who have the confidence to invest, to build, expand and look for new markets. I support that very strongly. I say good luck to them all. Our responsibility is to make that attractive in order that they can be confident in that stability. It is not about elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_289"> The Deputy made the point about there being no flesh on the bones. The HSE confirmed to me yesterday at a committee meeting I attended that it actively engages with young nurses coming out of training in order that they can work here in Ireland. It is not always possible to get them to stay here, as the Deputy knows.</p>

            <p eId="para_291">The nurses coming out of training are actively engaged with the nurses who have left and who work in the NHS in England or in other countries. They tell them about the current situation. I take the Deputy's point about teachers not having full-time contracts and not being able to get them. The case to which he referred seems to be extraordinary in its timeframe. The Government has sanctioned the employment of considerable numbers of teachers. Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills brought a memorandum to Government, which has been approved, for the appointment of another 610 special needs assistants.</p>
            <p eId="para_292"> When I talk to Science Foundation Ireland and to many of the companies involved in ICT or in the digital area, I hear that increasing numbers are involved in research and innovation and that there are career opportunities. I was in Dropbox in the Dublin docklands recently. One hundred companies in the docklands are conducting research and innovation and the workers have career paths. The same applies in the colleges of technology and the universities where extraordinary research in a number of fields is being carried on. It may not be as strong as we would like it to be but I hope that the challenge for the Government as set out in this budget and in the previous budgets is to secure that recovery for the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> Deputy McDonald mentioned the housing situation in Dublin. I cannot but agree that this is a real challenge. I met the Ard-Mhéara and I had a brief discussion with her. I wished her the best of luck in her responsibilities as Ard-Mhéara. I pointed out to her that we need to have a discussion about her views on housing and we will follow through with some really focused attention on a package of measures to increase the supply of houses. No matter what we talk about in this House, no matter what proposals are made by the Deputy, we need blocks and concrete on the ground to provide extra accommodation for people who need it. It requires building works as well as using the voids, the reconstructed voids and the social housing programmes under the local authorities. However, we also need to get the private construction sector back into action.</p>

The Deputy will know that the local councillors have the opportunity to address the situation by means of the property tax rate which they set and, if they wish to decline it, that is their right because they are elected representatives. We will focus on the question of the Dublin problem and the peripheral Dublin problem next week at a meeting I have called specifically for that purpose. After last Christmas there was a homeless problem, with people sleeping rough and in hostels. A great deal of effort and money was expended and then it ended. Now I hear that it is growing again.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_178">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_336">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 32, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_337"> I met Prime Minister Cameron in Downing Street on 18 June last. I congratulated him on his electoral success. I briefed him on Ireland's continuing economic recovery and informed him of our determination to ensure ongoing and sustainable growth in jobs and economic output.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> We both agreed that relations between Britain and Ireland were never stronger. We noted the importance of the recent visit of the Prince of Wales and last year’s state visit to Britain by President Higgins, as well as our mutual involvement in this decade of commemorations. We noted good progress in key areas of the work programme arising from the joint statement of 2012, including trade promotion, the roll-out of the common travel area visitor visa arrangement, and co-operation on defence and security matters. </p>
            <p eId="para_339"> Since then I have spoken to the Prime Minister on the telephone to exchange expressions of sympathy on the tragic loss of life of citizens on both islands through the senseless terrorism in Tunisia. We noted that work continues to be progressed through bilateral contacts between our respective government officials, including at Secretary General and Permanent Secretary level. A further meeting of this group, which oversees progress on over 20 areas of co-operation, will take place this autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> With regard to British-EU relations, I expressed the Government’s strong view that Ireland very much wants the UK to remain within the EU. We believe that this is best for Ireland, best for British-Irish relations, including Northern Ireland and best for the EU as a whole. The Prime Minister acknowledged the mutual benefits of the high levels of connectivity of our two economies as well as the strong social and historical links between us.</p>
            <p eId="para_341">He confirmed that he wanted the United Kingdom to continue to play a central part in a reformed European Union and that much depended on the outcome of the negotiations in the coming months. I told the Prime Minister that we would be as constructive and positive as possible in the context of these negotiations. We will judge specific British proposals for changes either to EU legislation or policy on their merits when they are presented. Where the United Kingdom seeks reasonable and achievable adjustments in how the European Union operates, or in its own relations with it, our instinct will be to be sympathetic and supportive. At the same time, if and when we believe a UK proposition would be unrealistic or damaging, either to our interests or the broader functioning of the European Union, we will be upfront in saying so. </p>
            <p eId="para_342"> With regard to Northern Ireland, we affirmed our commitment to full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. We recognised the difficulties that must be faced by the Northern Ireland parties and confirmed that they continued to have our support in seeking to resolve welfare reform and related budgetary issues. We both agreed that it was critical that the Northern Ireland parties themselves should find a way through the impasse for the sake of the stability and growth of the economy, society and the political institutions of Northern Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_343"> I raised a number of legacy issues, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, Ballymurphy, the Pat Finucane case and collusion issues raised in recent television coverage. I informed the Prime Minister of my meeting with the Kingsmill families and our efforts to ensure we provided the greatest amount of material possible for the coroner’s inquest in accordance with the law. The Prime Minister said he wanted to deal with legacy issues to the greatest extent possible through the agreed arrangements set out in the Stormont House Agreement and we agreed on the need to continue to make progress on operational arrangements, including for the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval. Given our extensive agenda, it was not possible to get through all legacy issues such as the outstanding recommendations made in the Smithwick report. I did, however, raise the question of the UK Bill of Rights and stressed that changes to the Human Rights Act could have significant implications for Northern Ireland, given that the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, was one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement. The Prime Minister acknowledged that this aspect of any proposed change would require further consideration. At this time, no legislation is before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the UK Human Rights Act 1998. We will continue to monitor carefully developments in this area. </p>
            <p eId="para_344"> The day after my meeting with the Prime Minister, 19 June, I had the opportunity to chair a plenary meeting of the British-Irish Council in Dublin, during which I met the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness. On that day I also met the Scottish First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, with the other heads of delegation from devolved administrations and we discussed a number of issues, including the potential to build further on the very strong bilateral relations between Scotland and Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_345"> Earlier last month my Government colleagues and I met the Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister and the Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, and their ministerial team at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary session which I chaired in Dublin on 5 June. All of these meetings are part of the ongoing dialogue with parties in Northern Ireland, including two meetings attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in recent weeks to formally review progress on the Stormont House Agreement. In the course of these meetings he met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, and had bilateral contacts with the representatives of all the parties. He continues to keep in very close contact with developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_346"> I visited Northern Ireland on 26 and 27 March this year. I addressed the annual CBI conference on the evening of 26 March and met the CEOs of North-South bodies in Belfast. I visited a Co-operation Ireland project in Sandy Row and met the Lord Mayor of Belfast at City Hall. My programme also included a meeting in Bessbrook with the families of those killed in the Kingsmill atrocity. I also visited Ballymurphy and met members of the families of those killed in 1971. We will have an opportunity in the Dáil tomorrow to debate an all-party motion - I am grateful to Deputies for agreeing to this - on the events in Ballymurphy in August 1971 and the legacy issues that arise from them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_179">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_347">The Taoiseach has answered 31 questions together, 16 of which are mine. Three and a half years ago he told the House that he and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, had agreed an urgent set of priorities for Northern Ireland, including deepening economic activity, reviewing institutions and tackling sectarianism. There have since been a number of meetings but no progress. In reality the situation has been allowed to sleepwalk into crisis. The current institutions have been allowed to fall into DUP and Sinn Féin inertia, while the situation on the streets is relatively bad.</p>
            <p eId="para_348"> Everybody will condemn the behaviour last night of rioters in north Belfast. It is a natural outcome of leaders who work to exploit division rather than seek genuine dialogue and respect. The Nationalists of that area have a basic right to live without the sectarian intimidation they have experienced. I know that many on the other side want to find a genuine accommodation, but real leadership and active engagement have been missing.</p>
            <p eId="para_349"> Since 2012 the economic and social position of Northern Ireland has deteriorated. We have had a succession of political crises; sectarian tensions have risen; political participation has declined; and alienation from the system has grown. Given all of this, is it not time to try a different approach? Is it not time to become actively engaged again? Should the Taoiseach not admit that the approach which he and the British Prime Minister took at the outset and have followed has not worked and that it is time to change the level of engagement in Northern Ireland?</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> I put a separate related question to the Taoiseach about the British attitude to the Human Rights Act. The Tory manifesto in the recent UK general election promised to repeal the Human Rights Act and end automatic redress to European courts on human rights issues. A number of questions specifically deal with that issue and I do not believe the Taoiseach addressed it in his reply. This would be a clear breach of commitments made as part of the Good Friday Agreement. The Human Rights Act is a central part of the architecture of peace to which we signed up and for which the people voted. The Taoiseach has taken the approach of trying to avoid direct comments on British policy on most issues, but this must be different. We are not some disinterested party. We have a legal right to demand that no action be taken to undermine a formal treaty between our states. Will the Taoiseach commit to formally stating to the British Government that we oppose the efforts to undermine the Human Rights Act and that we will take legal action over breach of treaty commitments if it proceeds with that policy?</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> The British Prime Minister has outlined his demands for renegotiation of the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union at the most recent full meeting of the European Council and in separate meetings with national leaders. Bar what the Taoiseach has just said about taking a constructive approach and so on, he has not said anything about Ireland's position on any of the United Kingdom's core demands. Does he support the various areas in which it wants change? So far what we have heard from him are banal generalities about the United Kingdom looking for more competitiveness and that it does not want to move to an ever-closer Union. What does that mean in practice? What is the substance of the British position? For example, what specific changes is it seeking? Has the Government made formal statements on what the British Government is looking for in its agenda in terms of relationship with the European Union?</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> Therefore, there are three dimensions: Northern Ireland; Brexit, and the policy of the UK Tory Government to the Human Rights Act. I have had very little time to deal satisfactorily with the 16 questions I tabled.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_180">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_353">I believe 12 of the questions are in the name of Deputy Gerry Adams. Let me do my best to deal with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_354"> Over the weekend and last night we saw many incidents of race hatred in the North. The targets in many of them were Sinn Féin representatives whose election posters were placed on bonfires. In a particularly offensive incident an effigy of Michelle Gildernew was hung over a bonfire in Moygashel.</p>
            <p eId="para_355">A sign on the bonfire read "Sinn Fein Scum, hands off our culture. Public hanging 10.30pm." Election posters for others, including the Alliance Party, were also placed on bonfires. Last night there was trouble at the Ardoyne when members of the Orange Order attacked the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, following a decision by the Parades Commission not to allow them walk back through the nationalist area. A young teenager was run over by a car. I commend the efforts of local residents and PSNI officers who had to lift the car physically off the teenager.</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> Will the Taoiseach join with me in condemning all acts of race hatred and sectarianism and in calling on the leadership of the loyal orders and the Unionists’ political leadership to take a stand against all acts of race hatred and especially to use their influence to prevent the future burning of posters, banners, flags and effigies on 12 July bonfires? They cannot describe bonfires as part of their culture and not at the same time accept responsibility for the sectarian use to which many are put. The events of recent days are a source of deep concern to one and all but we should not lose sight of the fact that there were hundreds of loyal order marches yesterday which passed off peacefully. It is important to note that also. That certainly, by any standard, represents progress in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> In his so-called emergency budget the British Chancellor has spelt out plans to slash a further £12 billion from the British welfare budget. The British Government’s rationale and excuse for these measures is that support for the low paid and vulnerable is at the root of Britain’s current economic difficulties, or at least that is how the Tories see it.</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> I remind the Taoiseach that the British Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, who refused for months to detail the wider impact of potential cuts had told Martin McGuinness, joint First Minister, that they would be eye-watering. She was right in that assessment. The Northern Executive has little control of its own fiscal arrangements. It relies on a block grant from the British Exchequer. Many of the measures introduced by the Chancellor, George Osborne, last week are the direct responsibility of the British. The Executive has precious little say in them and we were conscious of all those factors in the negotiation of the Stormont House Agreement. Has the Taoiseach raised concerns with David Cameron, the Prime Minister, and the British system, about the welfare cuts and the block grant, and if so to what extent? Although the crisis hinges on the issue of welfare and protecting the most vulnerable in society, the cuts the British have introduced are much wider than that in respect of public service provision. We are, or need to be, very aware of the specific circumstances in the North of Ireland of a community and society coming out of conflict and the potentially destabilising effect of a system of vicious Tory cuts to basic public service provision there, bearing in mind that the Tories enjoy no electoral mandate from any section of the community in the North of Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_181">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_359">In response to Deputy Martin’s questions, we did sign a memorandum of understanding that covers a broad range of areas. There has been quite a deal of cooperation and benefit on both sides. In the hospitality sector there was the start of the Giro d’Italia and the Irish Open, which created an impact because of the young superstars on both sides of the Border, Northern Ireland being the jurisdiction of the World No. 1 golfer. Northern Ireland personnel in Brussels were part of our EU Presidency and were fully acquainted with all the issues going through, such as the reform of the Common Agricultural policy, CAP. We had a joint trade mission to Singapore with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and ministers from Britain and Northern Ireland, covering trade and several other areas. We made the point about the possibility of corporate tax being reduced in Northern Ireland and that will become effective in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> Deputy Martin raised the Human Rights Act. I mentioned this specifically to the Prime Minister. It is a part of the Good Friday Agreement. The views of this Government are clear and remain unchanged in that regard on the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_182">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_361">Is that being communicated to the British?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_183">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_362">Yes, directly to the Prime Minister. As we speak, there is no legislation before the British Parliament to repeal the UK Human Rights Act 1998. If any movement takes place on that we will be very focused on it. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish Government has a genuine interest in this and takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard the institutions and the Agreement's principles. The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected. We made that very clear to the Prime Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> Deputy Martin mentioned the issues the Prime Minister spoke about with the other EU leaders regarding the referendum question to be put to the British people in due course. He mentioned four things: competitiveness, national sovereignty, fairness and migration, and welfare. He has no intention of interfering with the free movement of people within the European Union. The Prime Minister gave a brief presentation to the European Council at a recent meeting. The outcome was that internal discussions on the matters he raised are beginning. They will go on until later in the year when an updated report will be presented to the European Council. He does not want to interfere with the freedom of movement. He has spoken about competitiveness and obstacles to business. We share many of these concerns. That is an issue for the Single Market, the digital market and so on. He made a point about the relationship between a country belonging to the euro and one that does not belong to it and where the boundaries lie. It is clear that fairness and migration are issues. Ireland differs from Britain on relocation of people in Greece or Italy who have been rescued from the Mediterranean, some by our naval vessel, <i>LE Eithne</i>. I was very clear with the Prime Minister about the human rights issue and the follow through in his communications with other EU leaders over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> In response to Deputy McDonald, of course I completely deplore what happened yesterday, the stoning of a bus in Greysteel and the events in the Ardoyne and Woodvale. I deplore anything to do with these comments about race or members of the Deputy’s party having their effigies burnt on bonfires. This is not acceptable. The Government is, and will remain, very clear on this issue. I condemn those completely who, through these mindless and thoughtless actions, have exacerbated a situation in Ardoyne and Woodvale and jeopardised the lives of the community and the young teenager injured when a car drove into the crowd. It is not acceptable for members of the Deputy’s party, or any other, to have their effigies burnt. That has no place in the Northern Ireland we all want to work for. I have no difficulty in deploring that. I will refer to this further at my next meeting with the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> The budgetary situation, welfare cuts and the block grant are strand one issues and are directly negotiated between the Executive and the British Government. I made the point to the First and Deputy First Ministers that Northern Ireland is a community and a series of communities coming out of conflict over several years and that, where imagination and a bit of creativity can be shown about budgetary affairs, that should be considered. The British Chancellor has made clear that there will not be different rates of welfare in Britain and Northern Ireland. This is an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_366">I am glad that the Deputy's party has approved the drafting of the budget. While there is a significant deficit in the budget, at least it allows the Executive to continue, which is fundamentally important because no one wants to see a return to direct rule from London. I hope the political process in Northern Ireland is able to put together a situation where Northern Ireland can continue on the path to peace and, I hope, improved prosperity in the time ahead. I accept that these are challenging times for the representatives in the Executive.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">It is not agreed. We are again witnessing the unnecessary guillotining of debate on important Bills, in this case, the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2014, on which essentially there will be about an hour's debate, followed by the Children First Bill 2014 on which there will also be about an hour's debate this evening. What we have been witnessing is the very bad handling of Dáil business in the past three to four months. In the early stages, from April and May onwards, very little legislation passed through the House. In fact, the House did not sit for quite a number of weeks. It sat for only a day and a half a week after the May bank holiday. I think I counted about 17 sitting days over a long period of time. If we go back over the last six months, the amount of time the Dáil has sat has not been very impressive, particularly in dealing with legislation. We then get to the end stage of the session and, in the past two to three weeks, we have been witnessing the ramming through of Bill after Bill, with debate being guillotined. This throws out the window all of the reforms that were meant to happen in how legislation was to be considered and dealt with in the House. It undermines the status of the House in terms of its credibility in dealing with legislation of importance. It is regrettable that the Government has ordered business in the House in this manner, with very late sittings, up to midnight in some cases, for the last few weeks. It a very shoddy piece of work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_373">Of course, as today is Bastille Day, the guillotine is out. The Government proposes to guillotine the debate on any number of Bills this week as it races towards the finish line of this Dáil session. I oppose the guillotining of the debate on Report Stage of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2014. What we have seen is four years of foot-dragging in reaching the final stages of the Bill that supposedly is to remove the bank veto. This is important legislation which merits adequate time. Some 29 amendments have been tabled since Committee Stage, some of which are quite detailed and which potentially will lead to substantive changes to the Bill. However, the Government has allocated less than two hours for the debate. If we do the maths, that means about four minutes have been allocated to deal with each individual amendment, which is clearly insufficient. In fact, it is more than insufficient; it is an insult to the Dáil. It is also the case that specific organisations such as FLAC have concerns about the capacity of the Bill to help people in mortgage distress. It has cited, for example, the cut-off date of 1 January 2015 as being problematic because it means that the bank veto is only being removed for those distressed mortgage holders in arrears before that date. There are also concerns that the appeals system will be expensive and unwieldy. The Taoiseach is wrong to try to railroad this and other legislation through the Dáil. It is another example of poor governance and denies the proper democratic oversight important legislation deserves.</p>

          <p eId="para_375"> In respect of what Deputies Martin and McDonald said, I think this Dáil is one of the top parliaments in Europe in terms of the number of days sitting and the length of days sitting. I am glad Deputy McDonald has pointed out the difference between herself and her leader. He says he is not very good at mathematics. Deputy McDonald has worked out precisely from a mathematical formula the length of time that is allocated here.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">It is not agreed based on the same principle as the opposition to the previous proposal. This again represents a guillotining of a very important Bill, namely, the Children First Bill. The proposal is that Report and Final Stages shall be taken today, but again, there is a very short amount of time to deal with the amendments and the issue itself. Coming after the guillotining of No. 39 it reflects very badly on how this House is being managed and organised by the Government side. It undermines any concept of parliamentary reform or any sense of credibility in terms of how we do our business.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">I agree with those comments. Once again, this is very important legislation that has been awaited for a long time.

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_505">I wish to raise with the Taoiseach the fact that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, refused a request to increase health funding to meet the ongoing need of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for approximately €1 billion. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, said the sum of €1 billion was a nice, round figure that the Minister for Health demands on an annual basis. There were more leaks of commentary from the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on Sunday.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Deputy Michael Moynihan will let the Taoiseach know of a case he is dealing with concerning a person over 70 years who is terminally ill with cancer. The person is on a relatively low income but cannot get a medical card. That reflects the very restrictive approach the Government is taking to issues such as that because of funding. The Deputy has been in regular contact with the authorities on the matter but he has not got a response. Could the Taoiseach let me know when the health (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be brought before the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> The Government gave a specific commitment in the programme for Government to insist on the highest standards of transparency in the operation of NAMA, on reduction in the costs associated with the operation of NAMA, and that decision making of NAMA does not delay the restoration of the Irish property market. We have read that approximately €229,000 of taxpayers' money was spent on protecting the right of NAMA to be treated differently to other public authorities in terms of responding to freedom of information requests. The case has gone all the way to the Supreme Court. I believe it was a Mr. Gavin Sheridan who challenged the position. The situation is scandalous. The Government has backed NAMA all the way on the Supreme Court case, despite the programme for Government commitment to which I just referred. When will the Government implement its legislative commitment to bring transparency to NAMA, to which all the Government parties agreed in 2011?</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Last Sunday, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> carried a shocking report about Belfry funds. AIB took €300 million from 3,000 ordinary customers between 2002 and 2006, and all of the money is gone. Most of them were PAYE workers, not speculators, and the bank gambled on their life savings. When can we expect the financial (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and will the Government take legislative action to prevent such activity from happening again?</p>

          <p eId="para_509">Under the Haddington Road agreement, and a side deal struck thereafter, former Ministers and taoisigh are to receive an increase in their pensions. The Taoiseach will be aware that this has gone down like a lead balloon in the public sphere. What is the Taoiseach going to do about it? He has passed the ball to the recipients rather than the Government acting to remedy it.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Last week, the Tánaiste said the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, would examine issues involved in the Clerys dispute. We were also told that the review group has not been tasked with reviewing section 224 of the Companies Act 2014 on tactical insolvencies. Does the Government intend to use the powers under section 962 of the Companies Act 2014 to request that the review group provide a report? It would empower the Minister to ask the review group for a report on a specific issue contained within the Act. In light of the assurance given to the Dáil last week, will be Government exercise its power to task the review group with immediately reviewing the workings of section 224, as is its prerogative?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">The health (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is scheduled for later in the year. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will talk to each Minister, including the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, about issues that arise where shortfalls are identified in Departments or where it is deemed to be appropriate and a priority to deal with such matters. They are part of the budget Estimates process.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The Government does not dictate to NAMA on matters about which it might seek legal advice or pursuit through the courts. In this case, the Supreme Court has provided clarity, given that NAMA lost the case. The Government does not tell NAMA to take any case to court.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">I will bring him up to date on this. The pensions to which Deputy McDonald referred are determined by the scale of salaries that applied and two of three former taoisigh have said they will not accept a restoration of some of the pension cut that was imposed upon former Members of the House arising from the emergency financial legislation. A cut of 28% still applies to pensions higher than €100,000. As part of the reversal of some of the legislation, it is impossible to legislate for an individual or two in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_518">I am glad two former taoisigh have said they will not accept the part of the restoration of a pension cut. These very high pensions were determined by salary levels at the time, and are different now.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> With regard to Clerys, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, brought a report on the situation to the Cabinet, which was approved and published last week. He made the point that the legislation has not yet been tested. This is expected to happen and, depending on whether it stands up, it may be necessary to refer what happened here to the CLRG for its recommendations as to what, if any, changes might be necessary.</p>

        <heading>Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015: First Stage<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T17:30:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_520">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_521">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to exempt charity events and local community based festivals and events from policing service charges and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The Bill is a response to allegations that members of the Garda Síochána have been charging local community groups for the policing of local festivals and events. It is unacceptable that local community, voluntary and charity groups are expected to foot the bill for policing services and events and festivals. These groups are made up of committed and hard-working volunteers who plan and organise events and festivals to benefit local communities and businesses. Such groups often have to fund-raise to make such events happen and it is unfair to require them to pay for the work of the Garda Síochána on top of this. Charity events, community fairs and annual parish festivals are the lifeblood of rural communities. Such events encourage tourism and contribute to community spirit. It makes no sense to demand that organising committees pay for policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> In my county, Donegal, the thousands of euro demanded of one festival organising committee far exceeds the grants given to the festival by Donegal County Counsel and Fáilte Ireland. One arm of the State is paying for the services of another while local communities are burdened with the cost. Organisations that organise large-scale, commercial concerts and events that generate large revenues and profits should cover the cost of policing such events. However, section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which allows for requesting such payments, must be amended in respect of local community events, festivals and charity events, in order to protect our local groups and encourage local tourism. The Bill does that. It amends section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to exempt local cultural and heritage festivals, fundraising events for registered charities, local events organised on a voluntary basis and events that reinvest all profits for the benefit of the local community from the obligation to pay for policing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Last week, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said a policy review would suffice to address the problem. I urge the Minister and her colleagues to review the Bill in the hope that they will see the merits of a legislative safeguard to address the issue. The Bill is aimed at protecting our local communities and festivals and I hope the Government will support its passage through the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">Last week, on Monday, 6 July, Dublin Bus met with councillors from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to propose changes to the current network of services in the south-east area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. What has ensued since is a case of misinformation, speculation and conjecture because of the lack of hard concrete information. This has caused much upset and anxiety in the area. The routes under consideration include the Nos. 7A, 7B, 8, 45A, 59, 63 and 111 which serve many local communities throughout the Dún Laoghaire constituency. Constituents rely on these vital services and it is crucial any changes made are decided on after a fair and inclusive consultation with the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> I am calling on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure Dublin Bus runs an inclusive public consultation and informs the wider public when, where and how long such a process will take place. As far as I am aware, the consultation details have not yet been decided and the review is not available online. These steps should be taken as a matter of priority. It is unfair constituents have to learn from hearsay that their bus route may no longer exist or will be amended. Several constituents have contacted me already on the proposals, including local colleges which have firmly stated the potential adverse effects of any such change cannot be overestimated. We cannot forget the large elderly community in the constituency. These bus routes serve and act almost as a lifeline to elderly people, ensuring their daily mobility and independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> I have been in touch with Dublin Bus to arrange a meeting with its new chief executive, Ray Coyne. I will be recommending to him that the consultation uses all means possible, including open days in shopping centres similar to those for Dublin Bus’s Network Direct service and stands where Dublin Bus reps can take on board both positive and negative feedback. The public need to be heard on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_544">I am involved in organising a public meeting in Sallynoggin tonight where I expect large numbers of local residents to come and express their absolute fury and disbelief at a decision of two public bodies, Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority, NTA. These bodies, which are the Government’s responsibility, have made proposals to slash bus services in the greater Dún Laoghaire area, affecting bus routes Nos. 7, 59, 63, 8, 111 and 45A.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> In particular, Sallynoggin will be devastated with the proposal to take the No. 7 out of the area altogether. Killiney Village and Mackintosh Park off Pottery Road are to lose the No. 59 bus service. The frequency of buses to Loughlinstown Park is to be substantially reduced. Blackrock Village will no longer have the No. 7 going through it. Significant numbers of residents in large community areas, particularly the elderly, the young, students and the disabled, are going to suffer severely as a result of these proposals if they are implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> I do not want the Government to fob this of, claiming it is the NTA or Dublin Bus’s responsibility. These are bodies owned by the public and of which the Government is in charge. The NTA cannot be an excuse, like the Health Service Executive, for the Government to abdicate its responsibility. It is the Government’s cuts in subsidies to Dublin Bus that are forcing this agenda of privatisation of these services. Will the Government tell Dublin Bus and the NTA to get their hands off our local bus services? We need more, not fewer, buses through these areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_547">I am taking this important matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.</p>
            <p eId="para_548"> I understand the stress that can be caused in areas where there is talk about changes to bus routes. Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as amended by the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the NTA is responsible for the provision of bus services. The Minister has no role in decisions regarding bus routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> Subsidised bus services in Dublin are provided by Dublin Bus in accordance with the terms of its contract with the NTA. No changes to services can be made without the approval of the NTA. The Minister, however, has been informed by the NTA that subsidised bus services are constantly changing and evolving to better meet the needs of the travelling public and ensure best use of public funding. The NTA regularly meets with Dublin Bus to review the operation of the subsidised bus network.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> Dublin Bus is developing proposals to revise the current network of services in the south-east area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The purpose of the proposals is to improve the public transport network in the area, providing dedicated access to Loughlinstown Hospital, helping combat traffic congestion and increasing service levels to key destinations such as Cherrywood. Routes under consideration include Nos. 7A, 7B, 8, 45A, 59, 63, and 111.</p>
            <p eId="para_551"> Dublin Bus presented the emerging proposals to local councillors in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area on 6 July last. Dublin Bus will also be consulting with customers and other interested parties prior to finalising the proposals for consideration and decision by the NTA.</p>

            <p eId="para_552">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I am glad to hear Dublin Bus will be consulting customers and other interested parties. However, I want this to be a genuine conversation, not a one-way street. I am perturbed the details of the proposals are not up on the Dublin Bus website, even though a public meeting will be held tonight on them. It is difficult for people to know what exactly is the truth concerning these proposals. I want people, particularly older people, to be helped in this process. While Deputy Boyd Barrett has referred to some groups complaining, others are glad that some of the routes will change. At the same time, the concerns of older people and those with disabilities must be listened to.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">Dublin Bus is making €11 million in profits, carrying 4 million extra passengers and these numbers continue to rise. That means we need more, not fewer, buses. This is about profit, nothing more. For the Government, as the Minister of State has just done, to pass this off, claiming it has to do with the NTA and Dublin Bus, is nonsense. The NTA was set up by Fianna Fáil and continued by this Government. Owen Keegan, a Dublin city manager, and John Fitzgerald, a former city manager, are on the NTA board and are the Government’s appointees. We want them called to heel. It is this and the previous Governments’ decisions to cut subsidies to public transport in Dublin city from €85 million down to €60 million that has generated an artificial crisis in Dublin Bus services. This then has become the excuse for Owen Keegan, John Fitzgerald and other bodies to demand the reconfiguration of bus routes, meaning cuts. We lost the No. 46A through Monkstown Farm as a result of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">Now we will lose the No. 7 services through Sallynoggin from Loughlinstown. Killiney village will be devastated without the No. 59, Mackintosh Park etc. Of course, several of these routes are also earmarked for privatisation. It is a set-up what is going on here. There will be fury about this, and it will not be only as it was in one isolated area in Monkstown Farm on the last occasion. This is across the whole of Dún Laoghaire.</p>
            <p eId="para_555"> I ask the Minister to not fob this off. The Minister should intervene stating this is not acceptable. Dublin Bus is making profits. We have more passengers. We need more, not fewer, buses through those areas. The Minister should say, "No way", to these cuts.</p>

            <p eId="para_556">I draw the Deputies' attention to the fact that Dublin Bus is committed to meeting customers and interested parties - I will assume Deputy Boyd Barrett is an interested party - in regard to the proposed changes and will do so prior to finalising the proposals which, in turn, will require approval by the NTA. If I was to give advice to both Deputies and to the public meeting, they should try to work with the NTA and Dublin Bus and see can they come up with a working solution that will suit most of the service users who are on the route. The Deputies will find that the agencies will not be wanting. The Deputies should make their feelings known to the NTA and Dublin Bus, but try to find a solution that is workable for all interested parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_557">The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, is familiar with this issue. He would have seen for himself the impact of mica in terms of defective blocks in homes in Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> The scale of this, in terms of the amount of homes affected, is not fully known at this stage but the impact is clear. There are families this evening in my county who are literally living in terror that their ceiling or gable wall would collapse on top of them such is the seriousness of this issue. There are also families in Donegal this evening who cannot insure their homes because of this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> My colleague, Councillor Albert Doherty, has relentlessly pushed Donegal County Council to carry out testing on some of the housing stock in the county and a preliminary engineer's report has unfortunately found that mica is impacting on the homes that were tested. There is a lot more work to be done, but it is a serious development and confirms the worst fears of many within the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> I understand that preliminary engineer's report has been sent on to the Department and I welcome the news that the Minister has established an independent panel of experts, but here is my concern. Earlier I looked through the 200-page report and 20 recommendations of the panel of experts which dealt with the pyrite issue. Is the Minister reinventing the wheel? Have they not set a strong template? How long will this independent panel of experts take to report back?</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> I have met the families of which I speak in their homes. I attended a public meeting where they told their story. They are literally living in terror that the ceiling above them or the gable wall beside them will collapse on top of them. Their homes are not insured. The banks are not taking responsibility. Such is the seriousness of this issue. They cannot wait, perhaps for years, for an independent panel to report. We need urgent action.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"> I repeat the call of my party on the Minister to introduce a mica muscovite redress Bill as soon as possible over the summer recess, to bring that Bill before the Houses in the autumn and to implement a mica redress scheme, as this Government has done rightly for those families affected by the issue of pyrite. The impact is similar. Of course, these are separate deficiencies that affect the structure of the home but, if one looks at the 20 recommendations of the panel established on pyrite, I imagine they would almost all apply to this issue of mica.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> The Department had submitted blocks for testing. What was the outcome of those tests? Did they confirm the presence of mica in the blocks that were tested?</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> In terms of this panel of experts that the Minister will establish, is it reinventing the wheel? Is there a danger that it would drag on for far too long? What was the outcome of the tests on the blocks that the Department has done? Finally, what can the Minister do about the insurance companies which will not insure families in Donegal as we speak?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_565">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the extremely distressing and difficult situations that certain homeowners in Donegal are facing on account of damage to the structural integrity of their homes. I also add that I firmly believe that the parties responsible for poor workmanship and-or the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> It was against this background that my Department met a number of private homeowners in early December 2014. At that meeting, my Department requested the affected homeowners to make available copies of any technical reports that they may have commissioned from test laboratories on the affected concrete blocks in their homes. The provision of this information would provide my Department with an invaluable and scientific insight into the problems that have emerged in north Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_567"> In addition, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn stated, on the invite of my colleague, the Minister of State for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Joe McHugh, I visited a number of the affected homes in late February of this year to witness first-hand the damage to the homes and the real difficulties the homeowners and their families have to live with on a daily basis. Following that visit, copies of the requested test reports were provided to my Department and have now been reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_568"> From the test reports and information provided from other sources, the Department understands that problems mostly affect buildings constructed during the period 1999 - 2008, although at least one dwelling pre-dated this timeframe. There would appear to be a number of causes suggested for the alleged problems in the blocks such as low cement content, high moisture-low cement ratio, an abundance of mica, low density, low compressive strength and porosity.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> My Department understands that over 170 houses have been surveyed by homeowners and are confirmed as having problems in the block work. The Mica Action Group, which represents many of the affected homeowners, is of the view that there may be other housing schemes which have not yet discovered or reported problems with the block work in these homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> Furthermore, and as the Deputy has referred to, I understand that Donegal County Council commissioned consulting engineers to carry out sample investigations into cracking to external walls in a sample of local authority dwellings in a number of separate locations across the county. The results of these investigations will inform what further research and-or remedial works are required to the local authority dwellings.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the relevant contracting parties, that is, the homeowner, the builder, the materials provider and-or their respective insurers. In the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation, the option of seeking redress in the courts can be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> My Department understands that legal proceedings may have been instigated in some of the cases relating to this problem. This is the appropriate course of action in the event that the responsible parties, that is, the builder, the supplier and-or their insurers, do not face up to their responsibilities and provide a solution for the affected homeowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_573"> Notwithstanding the general position, a technical report has been prepared for me on my instruction and that is something I am currently considering. I also understand that the local authority will work closely with the tenants and elected members in terms of implementing any remedial works that may be required to its social housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_574"> We are not reinventing the wheel. The establishment of an independent panel is being considered. However, Sinn Féin is surely not suggesting that every building defect around the country should be resolved by the taxpayer. We need to be careful. The pyrite scheme to which the Deputy refers is a scheme of last resort.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">This is a matter of concern to me and something I will consider very closely with a view to making a decision shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_576">As the Minister of State will know, families in the council areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare, Meath, Offaly, south Dublin and Dublin city have rightly benefited from the pyrite redress scheme and that is the template under which he should move forward. He confirms that the tests carried out by his Department, like the tests carried out on behalf of Donegal County Council, have established that there are homes affected by mica within the county. The impact is devastating and terrifying. Can the Minister of State imagine a family who know that the gable of their house is affected by seriously defective blocks which could, according to engineers, collapse? The concrete ceiling over their heads is being held up by these blocks and it, too, could collapse. This is the terror families face. There are also families who cannot have their homes insured.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> The problem in taking the legal route is the same as that in dealing with the pyrite issue - the Statute of Limitations comes into play. Will the Minister of State, please, not abandon these families to legal recourse? It is clear that they purchased their homes and the blocks to build them in good faith and now they are left in this situation because of poor regulation, as was also demonstrated in the pyrite issue. The 20 recommendations made in the pyrite report stress the issues around regulation, poor standards and the need for change. The families in question are caught up in a similar debacle. I appeal to the Minister of State to put in place a mica redress scheme Bill, along the lines of what was brought forward to deal with the pyrite issue. Will he, please, not abandon the hundreds of families across the county of Donegal to the terrible dilemma in which they find themselves?</p>

            <p eId="para_578">As I said, I am extremely aware of the difficult and distressing circumstances in which the homeowners and families in question find themselves. I have visited their homes and spoken to them. I reiterate, however, that building defects are generally matters for resolution between the relevant contracting partners, namely, the homeowner, the builder and the materials provider and-or their respective insurers. I urge the responsible parties in the cases the Deputy mentions to take all appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners. Similarly, if any of the affected homes is covered by a structural guarantee or structural insurance, the homeowner may wish to pursue this avenue to seek redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_579"> The Deputy keeps mentioning the pyrite redress scheme. That was a scheme of last resort where builders or suppliers who should have been accountable could not be legally pursued by the people involved. I do not want to see any family abandoned who have been left in the lurch, but the State cannot intervene when responsible people or entities can still be pursued. That has to happen as we cannot expect the State to remedy every building defect in the country when there are people who should be held to account for the very substandard buildings they have put up for innocent families.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> I am sympathetic to those involved, which is why I visited them and commissioned a report on the matter. I am considering taking it a step further, but I urge the Deputy and other Deputies such as my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, who is closely involved in assisting the people in question, to pursue those involved to the end to ensure there is accountability. I am considering the report and will make further decisions in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_581">The Minister may be aware that two day care facilities in County Clare, namely, in Raheen and Kilrush, are to be closed from Monday for a period of two weeks and possibly more. This is creating significant stress among the population who use these facilities on a daily basis. They collectively cater for some 200 elderly individuals in the community on a weekly basis. I do not need to remind the Minister of the importance of day care centres, not just to the residents but also to the entire health system. They can act as an early warning device in recognising illness in residents, ensure any minor illness is picked up at an early stage to prevent from it developing and sometimes avert the necessity for long-stay care. The facilities in question do an immense amount of good work and are a great basis on which to provide an adequate health care system for the people in question..</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> It appears that the Government has not done enough in advance planning. We have been given excuses by the Department of Health, through the HSE at local level, that they do not have an adequate supply of nurses and that there is no supply of agency nurses. I have to believe this reflects negatively on the Department and the Minister for Health. It was the then Minister, Deputy James Reilly, who abolished the HSE and took full responsibility back within the control of the Minister for Health and the Department. Therefore, the blame lies at their door, not at that of the HSE or local management. We are led to believe this is not about financial resources but about the deployment of personnel. It is incumbent, therefore, on the Government to ensure there is enough advance planning. Everybody recognises that this is the holiday period and that people get sick. Therefore, there should be capacity to put in place a proper HR management system that will identify requirements and ensure staff will be available to meet the need.</p>

            <p eId="para_583">I will not reiterate what my constituency colleague has said, except to say there is significant distress because of this issue, caused not just by the announcement but also by its nature. This is not the first time we have had such an announcement. In this forum I raised the issue of the closure of a ward in St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis, a facility which also treats elderly people. The ward was closed without notice and people were moved throughout the evening and early the next day. Thankfully, it was reopened after two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> I do not think it can come as a surprise that people take holidays. In any work environment or management setting it is something managers have to deal with. Even those who manage one or two people have to take account of the fact that they will take holidays. The date on which tenders were received for the first phase of work to bring Raheen Hospital into compliance with HIQA standards was 10 July, which was good news. It was a statement of intent that Raheen Hospital would continue into the future, but then the news came, on what was otherwise a good news day, that the day care centre would not be open on Monday. If there are shortages, surely the very least that should happen is that people should be told a couple of weeks before in order that those patients reliant on the service and their family members can make plans. It is not just the announcement that is worrying but its timing. It does not cover the HSE in glory in the way it has been managed. I appreciate the reasons, namely, that it is based on sick leave, because people do get sick, but we also know that there is an increased tendency for nurses and medical personnel to get sick because they deal with people who are sick. That is inevitable in managing a health service.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_585">I join colleagues in raising genuine concerns about the discontinuation of vital day services at the Raheen and Regina House community nursing home units. Yesterday I received a response from the chief executive officer of the mid-west community health care team which confirmed that the temporary closure of these units had not been influenced by the availability of financial resources but by the unavailability of nursing staff in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">Factors such as annual leave, sick leave and the unavailability of agency staff were cited.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> The day care centres at Raheen and Regina House community nursing units provide wonderful services to older people in both east and west Clare. Not enough credit or priority is given to day care centres in terms of their role in delivering our national health service. The provision and development of community-friendly day care services offers a real and significant win-win situation to the client and the State as keeping people at home for longer avoids clogging up residential care settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> It is highly regrettable that staff and clients at Raheen and Regina House community nursing units were informed at 2.30 p.m. last Friday that their respective day care centres would not open the following Monday. This action poses questions in terms of the staffing roster. Surely the roster for these day care centres are put together monthly. Why could the clients and staff not be told earlier? What efforts are being made to recruit new nursing staff? The bottom line is when these units will be reopened. Will the Minister of State assure the House today that these temporary closures will not happen again?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_589">The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. It is clear this is what older people want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route, which is why services such as day care, meals on wheels and the availability of respite facilities are so important. I agree with each of the Deputies who have spoken on this issue in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Raheen community nursing unit and Regina House community nursing unit. Both centres are registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority. The services provided at these units are a vital part of the supports for older people that allow them to maintain their independence and quality of life in a way that meets their own wishes. Raheen community nursing unit, which was originally a private house, has been used since 1973 to provide services for older people in south-east Clare. The centre can accommodate up to 25 residents, including 15 long-stay places and ten short-stay beds comprising respite, palliative care and rehabilitation beds. There are supported living units in the grounds of the building. Raheen community nursing unit also provides day care for up to 20 people on weekdays. Regina House community nursing unit, which opened in 1972 as a welfare house, is now a residential centre for older people and is also registered with HIQA for up to 30 residents. There is a separate day care service for older people in the adjoining building which caters for up to 25 people from the local community on weekdays.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> On the temporary closures, and people need to realise it is a temporary closure, of the day centres at Raheen and Regina House community nursing units, the Health Service Executive has confirmed that these are not influenced by the availability of financial resources. The decision to close the facilities temporarily was because of the unavailability of nursing staff over the next number of weeks. The contributory factors are annual leave, sick leave and the unavailability of agency staff. I stress this is a short-term measure for a couple of weeks only. I recognise the primary responsibility is to provide safe care to the residents of the units and to ensure the availability of access to respite residential services for the elderly population in the area. The HSE is committed to restoring the day care services at both centres as soon as possible. Every effort will be made to minimise disruption to service users. If any person using the services has particular difficulties, I urge them to contact Raheen or Regina House community nursing units directly and the HSE will do everything in its power to support him or her.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> It is worthy of explanation to note that the difficulty in respect of nursing staff and the unavailability of nurses is not just in this area. We have considerable difficulties in other areas. As both centres are registered with HIQA, it is incumbent on us to stay within the guidelines set down by it. We have a difficulty recruiting a range of nursing staff, particularly nurses who work in psychiatric services and in the area of care for the elderly. They are not seen as the most attractive areas in which to nurse, although I often find it can be the most rewarding. Services such as this one provide, as the Deputies have already said, an invaluable service.</p>
            <p eId="para_593"> The reason for the late notice is the HSE was, until the last minute, trying desperately to recruit agency nurses. Even they are not available. I think it has something to do with the time of the year. Along with everything else, nurses within the agency sector are usually young and are off doing different things at this time of the year. It is not something we are letting rest. We will endeavour to put the service back as quickly as possible. I appeal to people to have a little patience but I understand fully the difficulties in which it places families.</p>

            <p eId="para_594">A couple of hundred people are being disenfranchised for the want of two nurses, which highlights the massive problem that is the shortage of nurses. If two nurses out of the system can have that big an impact, what happens if four or five nurses are sick tonight because of an outbreak of a bug in the mid-west? Could it lead to the closure of a number of wards at University Hospital Limerick? Is the line that fine at the moment? Is that what has been achieved? Is she telling me that, having dispensed with the HSE and its board and having taken control of the delivery of health services in this State for the past four years, the Department is still relying on excuses grounded in not knowing or expecting a couple of people would be off sick? Is that any way to run a health service? I am not directing this at the Minister of State personally but towards the Government and the senior Minister who hoodwinked the people. The Government lay the blame for the difficulties on the heads of the HSE when in truth it was a ruse to win an election. Taking control back into the Department of Health has made things worse. The Minister of State is saying it is not a financial resources issue. It is a result of massively poor planning, responsibility for which lies firmly and squarely at the feet of the Minister for Health and the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">I welcome the Minister's commitment to ensuring these services at Raheen and Regina House community nursing units open as soon as possible. There is a further problem, however, for people who receive these services. Some of these people would also hope to receive home help at some point. There is an incredible disparity in the distribution of home help hours in the mid-west. The population aged over 65 in Limerick is 21,032. In Clare, it is 13,292 and in the north Tipperary-east Limerick area it is slightly less, at just under 13,000. Despite this, when one looks at the number of people in receipt of home help hours per month in 2015, in Limerick, it is 1,437, in Clare, it is 961, and in north Tipperary-east Limerick, it is 1,241. When one looks at the actual hours allocated, there is a similar discrepancy, which is inexplicable. Why does the population in north Tipperary-east Limerick receive one and a half times the number of home help hours received by the population in Clare? It is an appalling inequality and one that needs to be addressed. Progress has been made in the lifetime of this Dáil in this regard but not enough progress. A lot more needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">I will be brief. At certain times of the year staff shortages are more acute than at other times. That is obvious. Certain periods used to bedevil the last Government, especially the Christmas and new year period, if I remember correctly. Anyway, it was always that winter period. That is always an issue. People have a right to take their holidays. I am not suggesting people have a right to be sick but, when they are sick, they have a right to take time off to recuperate. It is important when nurses are dealing with older and vulnerable people and they become ill that they can take the necessary time off. We do not want them to work in circumstances that are less than ideal. Equally, we do not want people getting infections from one another, as can often happen in this type of setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> Home help is allocated on an individual basis. It used to be allocated on a block grant basis, but not anymore. Each individual is assessed for the amount of home help he or she needs. Obviously, it is not as much as we would like but nevertheless that is what happens.</p>
            <p eId="para_599"> I will set out for Deputy Carey what we are doing in respect of recruitment. I have said this so often in the House in respect of different areas. We are now into our second phase of recruiting overseas, in England, in particular, where many of our nurses went. We are there desperately trying to encourage people back. We are offering them a good standard of pay. I suppose the only thing any country can really offer is its environment and living and working conditions, and that is what we are doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> This year we are targeting new graduates. We have stands in the universities and we are desperately trying to recruit people from that cohort. However, young people who are newly qualified want to work abroad as well. They want the adventure of it and we cannot stop them from doing that. Anyway, we remain hopeful that some of them will stay at home and work within the system. In case some Deputies believe Clare is the only area affected, according to the last information I have there are 40 vacancies for nurses in Cork University Hospital. Yet in the case of anyone who walks in the door looking for a job, we are offering them a contract and a job. Despite this we are finding it remarkably difficult. We are not the only country with this difficulty. The UK has this difficulty and that is why those responsible recruit here. Canada is offering such rewards that we cannot possibly compete, but it is because the services there have shortages too. This is something we all have to deal with, despite having increased the amount of people graduating every year.</p>

            <p eId="para_601">I cannot believe we are in the Chamber discussing this again. This is another circumstance which, to my mind, represents an utter betrayal of the women who survived the Magdalen laundries. In their youth these women were violated and abandoned by the State. They had to fight for decades to receive redress for the damage done to them by the State. Now, we are about to implement this redress scheme, but what do they find?</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> Let us put first things first. The medical card they have been issued with is effectively branded. It is stamped in clear writing that the scheme relates to people eligible under the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act, thus identifying them as Magdalen survivors. I cannot believe how anyone dreamt this up. I assume the justification is that this entitlement will give concessions that other medical cards do not give - I will deal with that point. If that is the justification, it could easily have been done by an initial or something like that. The idea that these women should have their privacy breached in circumstances involving their doctor, pharmacist, the person who finds their handbag on the bus, or a grandchild, who picks up the card and asks her granny what the words mean, is absolutely outrageous. These branded medical cards must be withdrawn. I would love to see an answer to the question of who dreamed it up. I simply do not know but I expect there should be a public apology for that aspect of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> The second aspect is equally important. These women were led to believe by Mr. Justice Quirke and others that they were entitled to a medical card with benefits equal to the benefits of those under the Health (Amendment) Act scheme. Under the HAA scheme the supporting documentation ran to 58 pages setting out the benefits available to people on that scheme. The additional documentation for this scheme runs to five pages. As Justice for Magdalenes has said, it amounts to not much more than an ordinary medical card, which 90% of the women have anyway. The drugs, medicines and appliances are restricted to what is on the reimbursement list anyway. There are no complementary therapies, no counselling without a general practitioner referral, no counselling for family members, no appeals or complaints board and nothing for the women overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> This absolutely needs to be addressed. It represents a betrayal of these women. The scheme itself is completely inadequate. As organisations like Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the National Women's Council of Ireland and Justice for Magdalenes have pointed out, it is not actually human rights compliant at all. These women deserve more. My appeal to the Minister of State, and that of Justice for Magdalenes, is for emergency legislation to address this shortfall and ensure the scheme is in line with what Mr. Justice Quirke recommended. Those involved point out that 512 women have waived their right to legal action in anticipation that they would secure the full benefits. What they have got instead is a branded medical card and that is completely unacceptable.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_605">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Deputy will be aware that the Government accepted all the recommendations of the Quirke report and established an <i>ex gratia</i> restorative justice system. In that context, the Government set up a range of payments and supports for the women who worked in these institutions. Payments of up to €100,000 are made to these women, depending on their length of stay in the laundries. In addition, the Department of Social Protection is making pension-type payments to these women. I understand from the Department of Justice and Equality that over 500 applicants have received lump sum payments to a value of approximately €20 million to date. Mr. Justice Quirke also recommended that legislation be introduced regarding the provision of health services to Magdalen women. To that end, the Minister for Justice and Equality brought the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 through the Oireachtas. The Act sets out the primary and community health services that are made available free of charge to these women. These services include GP services; prescribed drugs, medical aids and appliances; dental, ophthalmology and aural services; home nursing; home support; chiropody; physiotherapy; and counselling services. A woman qualifies for these services where the Minister for Justice and Equality has determined that she is eligible under the restorative justice scheme and the woman has accepted a formal offer made to her under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> The HSE has contacted the qualifying women directly to issue them with the redress for women resident in certain institutions, RWRCl, card on the basis of information provided by the Department of Justice and Equality about the acceptance of an offer. The HSE has also provided information to the women about the health service. In this way, participants in the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme receive their RWRCI card to enable them to access easily the primary and community health services free of charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> I imagine the Deputy will appreciate that the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 was debated and approved by the Oireachtas earlier this year. Under the legislation, a medical card is not being awarded to the women. Mr. Justice Quirke did not recommend that Magdalen women should be awarded medical cards. In fact, the judge pointed out that most of the women already hold a medical card, as the Deputy has already stated. Therefore, we did not issue them with medical cards. Instead, a specific card is provided to the women to ensure they can access the health services without any charge, as set out in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> The separate RWRCI card is warranted because the women benefit from a greater range of entitlements than under the medical card. The cards provided to Magdalen women were intended to be similar in manner to the HAA cards. The shorthand name of the HAA card is based on the underlying legislation. The HAA cards are issued on the basis of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. The 1996 Act provides certain health services to persons who contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion. In this case, the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015, which this House approved without a vote earlier this year, provides primary and community health services without charge to women who were admitted to and worked in certain institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">In the same way, these cards are called RWRCI cards as a shorthand description of the Act. It will be relevant to the Deputy to note that it was never intended to cause any offence or embarrassment by referring to the Act on the card. However, I accept that putting the full title of the Act on the card identifies the holders in a way that the Health (Amendment) Act card does not. I only saw the card this afternoon. I am completely open to changing the title as it appears on the card if this is what the women want. It will only require a small effort to correct it and I am happy to ensure it will happen. I hope this puts the issue to rest.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> I will not conclude with what is contained in my script. I must state that had I seen the card in advance, it would not have been issued. I have given instructions in respect of it. I am not certain that we should withdraw the card, but Mr. John Hennessy, director of primary care in the HSE, will meet relevant stakeholders to determine what the design should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_611"> Like the Deputy, I do not understand why the full title should have been on the card since the card had to be used for identification or to hand to the secretary of the general practitioner. The initials would have been enough. We do have to indicate that the card is different. This is important, but it was equally important to settle on the form of identification.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> I have been centrally involved in the Magdalen issue, as Deputy Clare Daly knows. Really and truly at this late stage, identification in the manner in question is not appropriate. We will ask the director of primary care to sit down with the relevant authorities to address the issue. However, this is not even needed as we all know instinctively how we would go about it. What is required is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_613"> I am not certain that I want the women to return their cards, but I am saying to the Deputy that new, more appropriate cards will be issued.</p>

I fully appreciate her bona fides on the issue of identification. The identification was outrageously insensitive, almost cruel, thoughtless and really clumsy. That somebody made this mistake was just ridiculous after all the women had been through. I fully acknowledge that the Minister of State has said she will address the issue and I am glad that it is happening. This will be best achieved through consultation with those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> The bigger issue for many of the people affected is obviously the shortcomings of the scheme. We discussed them at the time of the passage of the legislation. It is still the case that the women are very disappointed by the shortcomings. While I appreciate the nuanced statement of Mr. Justice Quirke that the card was not to be a medical card but a health services card, this led the women to believe they would have far greater entitlements than would be afforded with an actual medical card. In actual fact, it gives them little more and is not in any way on a par with the HAA card. Perhaps we have had this debate before, but when the women see the entitlements written down, the disparities are driven home. I would like to see this issue addressed through emergency legislation, although I know that is not very likely to happen. However, I am at least glad that one aspect of the issue is being addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_616">Since we were so anxious to do exactly what Mr. Justice Quirke had asked us to do, the legislation was very prescriptive. What was not prescribed, of course, was what happened in regard to the card, the health services card. I hope we will rectify the matter as quickly as possible. It would not be appropriate to ask the women themselves to return the cards. I am not certain how that would work, but I am saying the new card, when issued, will be anonymised as much as possible, although I am not certain it will be more discreet. It will have to be identifiable as being different from the other card. We all accept this.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_617">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_618">That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_619">Ombudsman Act 1980 (Section 1A) (No. 2) Order 2015,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_620">copies of which have been laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann on 8th July, 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I ask the House to approve the draft Ombudsman Act 1980 (Section 1A) (No. 2) Order 2015. The order has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Its purpose is to extend the Ombudsman's remit to include private nursing homes the residents of which are in receipt of State funding or support. The order revokes Order No. 270 because, on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is of the view that it is appropriate to seek the approval of each House for the order.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The State, through the nursing homes support scheme, was funding 22,142 nursing home residents as of the end March this year. This includes residents in public, voluntary and private long-term residential care who are receiving financial support. While public nursing homes are already within the Ombudsman's remit, private nursing homes the residents of which receive State funding are not. We want these residents and their families to be afforded greater accountability and assurance. This can be achieved through the work of the Ombudsman who, in a fair and impartial manner, examines complaints. We, therefore, want these residents who are in receipt of public money to be in a position to direct their concerns to the independent authority that is the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> In accordance with the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, it is the intention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to make this draft ministerial order. As prescribed by the Act, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has engaged in a consultation process on the order. This included the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, the Health Service Executive, the Health Information and Quality Authority and Nursing Homes Ireland, a representative organisation for the private and voluntary nursing homes sector. The proposed order has received broad support and welcome from these stakeholders. The Ombudsman has stated the order is comprehensive. Both the Ombudsman and Nursing Homes Ireland requested a delayed commencement date. The Minister has acceded to this request and as seen on the draft order, it is proposed that it will commence on 24 August. This delay between the date of making the order and the date of operation will afford his office sufficient time to communicate with nursing homes and their representative body on the role of the Ombudsman, its operations and procedures. It will also allow individual nursing homes to develop robust internal complaints systems if these are not already in place. The order will not operate retrospectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The proposed extension of the Ombudsman's remit will complement the existing work being undertaken by both HIQA and the HSE. While HIQA has the authority to inspect and regulate public, voluntary and private long-stay residential care services, its remit does not allow it to examine individual complaints made to it or issues raised by residents or their representatives directly. Also, the HSE does not have the authority to examine these complaints that arise in private nursing homes. It can do so only if HIQA specifically asks that it undertake an assessment on an individual resident's health status.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> By approving the order, we are affording some of our most vulnerable citizens the opportunity to access independent redress. This will ensure these nursing homes residents and their families will be provided with an additional level of support and the opportunity to access an outside authority should complaints or issues not be managed appropriately within the private residential care setting. It offers a very important and positive step in the delivery of services funded by the State through improved oversight and strengthened accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The extension of the Ombudsman's remit follows on from a commitment in the programme for Government to extend the Ombudsman's remit to include non-public bodies that are significantly funded by the State. In addition, it is in keeping with the scope of the Office of the Ombudsman which has always been focused on the delivery of publicly funded services. I commend the order to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_627">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion which I support. I wish to examine, in particular, the sad reason for our being here today. We all recall the tragic television programme on Áras Attracta towards the end of last year. Immediately afterwards, the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, was on "Morning Ireland" and radio reminding the public that he could examine complaints about the HSE and all HSE-run centres, including nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Áras Attracta was such a centre but people did not seem to know that they had the right to go to the Ombudsman so there is a lack of information, publicity and public awareness about his role. </p>
          <p eId="para_629"> The Ombudsman made it clear in his opening statement on 10 December that while he can examine complaints about public nursing homes, his office cannot examine the actions of private nursing homes. As a result of that, I wrote to him within a few days asking him to clarify that and to let me know the up-to-date position because he was keen that this should happen. Subsequently, in early January 2015, he wrote back to me about private nursing homes. He said that the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 was being looked at and that there had been discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. He indicated that he would like to see this extension of jurisdiction brought forward as a priority. On various occasions during Question Time over the past couple of months I quizzed the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose Department is responsible for the Ombudsman, about this. He told me that information was sought and travelled between his Department and the Ombudsman. I am happy that this has come to a conclusion and we are here today with the draft order. </p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I hope that this will be accompanied by a publicity campaign informing the public and residents in these institutions and that there would be a leaflet in each institution telling visitors and the families of residents about the Ombudsman's role. The Ombudsman already has authority in respect of HSE-run services but many residents never knew that. They all know about HIQA. One cannot go into a nursing home without HIQA being mentioned within a few minutes so it is important that residents know about the Ombudsman's role. </p>
          <p eId="para_631"> There is a little bit of this in the way the Government tends to work. I am not personalising it in respect of this Government. Consider all the people who were consulted during the consultation period. They included the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, the HSE, HIQA and Nursing Homes Ireland. There is no mention of patients and their families, the people who are probably most affected. It is probably a reflection of how the public service in Ireland is run. It consults every public service body but not the users. This is here to protect the user.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Again, I stress that I am pleased that this is now happening. I have no problem with the fact that the Office of the Ombudsman needs a couple of months to put the procedures in place to notify the public. Nobody can argue with that. It is an important issue. There must be some mechanism, possibly through the fair deal scheme. The Minister of State quoted a figure of 21,142. When the Department of Health is communicating with these people, I suggest that it sends a leaflet to them or their representatives or families to let them know about this because it would be dreadful if some of the incidents we saw in Áras Attracta were happening in some of these private nursing homes. I am not suggesting they are. I am not saying they are perfect but I have no evidence of any particular problem. I believe that if the role of the Ombudsman is to operate satisfactorily, people need to know that the Ombudsman has this role. </p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I have confidence in Peter Tyndall and have been in correspondence with him about this issue. It has taken a bit of time to work through. Ultimately, it will probably have implications for resource and staffing requirements relating to the Ombudsman if more complaints start to come through because it will not just involve those on the fair deal scheme. I have a question the Minister of State could clarify. I know that the Ombudsman has a role because much of the income in private nursing homes comes from the fair deal scheme and because it is a substantially funded public body but what about people who pay their own way? Perhaps they are not on the fair deal scheme and had some assets. Will these people be able to go to the Ombudsman even though they are in nursing homes under the fair deal? I hope they will be able to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_634"> This is a welcome extension of the Ombudsman's powers. I hope that any complaints he receives will be thoroughly investigated and that it will be a help and comfort to people to know that this procedure is in place.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_635">I welcome the extension by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to accept complaints on behalf of residents in private nursing homes. Anyone who pays attention to the media reports regarding standard of care in nursing homes across the State is aware that there are widely differing experiences in the care of our vulnerable and elderly citizens. I believe that the experience of most is right and proper but we know that we must remain vigilant or we risk allowing special and wonderful people to be cut off completely from the rest of society. As many as 22,500 people will now be able to avail of this extension to the remit of Peter Tyndall's office if, for whatever reason, they or their loved ones need to.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> The current situation where those residing in private nursing homes have to rely on making a complaint to those in charge of the facility is far from ideal. Many families are scared of making such complaints as they fear that they might be seen as troublemakers and lose their loved ones' places. It is also of concern that the Ombudsman and others, including this Deputy, have been calling for this since 2013 but it is only now coming into place. I am not so naive to believe that all residents in private facilities are treated with the standards we expect. To have to wait for two years to have access to an independent complaints process must have been an eternity for some. Indeed, some will have passed away without having had such access. This fact must spur the Minister to now act with urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I appreciate that there were issues involved in bringing private facilities under the Ombudsman's remit. Whether the residents or the units themselves get State funding is relevant but it should not be allowed to bring such a necessary process to a halt. This issue raises its ugly head across the board. When State services are privatised, they are often no longer under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. We saw this in the case of Uisce Éireann and its removal from the jurisdiction of Peter Tyndall's office. This was particularly galling given that this body acts as if it is not accountable to anyone. Direct provision must also be brought under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. This system, as it is currently operated, is an abuse of basic freedoms and should be abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> In May of this year, Sean Moynihan, the CEO of Alone, raised the private nursing home issue with me. At that time, concerns were being raised about HSE facilities in various areas. I stated then that private residential facilities should be open to further scrutiny, including that of the Ombudsman. I wrote to the Minister for Health on this subject and, in turn, contacted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The RTE "Prime Time" television programme on Áras Attracta, which was broadcast on 9 December 2014, showed hidden camera footage of appalling standards of care for residents in one of the bungalows in that complex. We must operate on the presumption that such disgraceful conduct might well be replicated in units in the private sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_639"> In discussing this motion, we must not lose sight of the fact that one in three people in nursing home care in this State could be supported to live in the community. The Government must act to ensure that anyone who wants to can live at home with appropriate supports. This is right and proper for those concerned and proves more affordable for the State. We need to be aware of this given that it is predicated that by 2026, 16% of the population will be over 65, myself included. A related matter is a patient safety authority, which I have previously proposed. Such a body would be able to enforce the standards laid out, investigated and reported on by HIQA. It is important that this body would also cover private sector settings. Such an authority would be able to ensure implementation of recommendations arising from HIQA reports and to ensure that quality and standards are kept high throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Cuirim an-fháilte roimh leathnú chumhachtaí an Ombudsman do dhaoine atá ina gcónaí i dtithe altranais príobháideacha. Ciallaíonn sé seo go mbeidh muid in ann tuilleadh muiníne a bheith againn as na caighdeáin atá ar fáil sna hionaid seo. Cinntíonn sé gur féidir le daoine agus le teaghlaigh cabhair agus cúnamh a fháil ó fhoras neamhspleách agus iad ag dul i ngleic le seirbhísí nach bhfuil ag feidhmiú mar is ceart.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_641">I also support this motion. It is vital that private nursing homes be included within the remit of the Ombudsman if we are to take elderly care seriously. We cannot have two elderly care policies, one public and the other private. All institutions, organisations and companies which provide services for a vulnerable population need the objective and reliable model of scrutiny which the Ombudsman provides. The service users should always have the right to seek accountability regarding those who oversee and manage their care.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">It serves to honour and protect the dignity that elderly people deserve in the later years of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> However, a few concerns remain. The remit is narrow as it only applies to nursing homes which are funded by the State through the nursing homes support scheme. Ideally, I would like to see any place that deals with elderly care fall under the remit of scheme but as demand for the fair deal scheme is increasing over time this motion will have a significant impact. I would have a concern that there could be two patients in the same nursing home, one of whom will have access to the Ombudsman and one who does not have that access. In an ideal world, residential care would not be the focal point of our national ageing policy. We will always need nursing homes and everyone is entitled to the option that meets their needs best but many people can live at home and want to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> According to the Government's National Positive Ageing Strategy 2013, the stated national policy was to enable people to age with confidence, security and dignity in their home and communities for as long as possible. However, as we have seen with the primary care model and in our mental health policy, resources do not match the intention. According to Age Action, in 2013, out of a total budget of €1.39 billion, 72% was spent on the nursing home support scheme which supports over 22,000 elderly people, approximately 4% of the population aged 65 and over. Only 14% of this was spent on home help services, with 9% on home care packages. Home help funding has declined by almost 12% since 2009 and while the hours may have increased and the number of patients in receipt of hours may have increased, the quality of the time they receive has decreased. Age Action has noted a trend in the admissions policies of nursing homes which have increased the number of low to medium dependency people being admitted while lowering the number of high dependency residents. High dependency residents end up staying in local community hospitals rather than in nursing homes. I wonder if this model has been adopted to manage more people for less hassle and at a lower cost than admitting older, more dependent people into nursing homes. This may especially be the case for private nursing homes too who are run on a profit margin.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> While there is statutory support for nursing home care, there is none for home help and this model does not make sense. I acknowledge that the family structure has changed. We do not all live with three generations under one roof and both parents working is the new norm. However, we do not empower people to be carers nor do we support people when they do care for others. Carers have no standing in today's society. The cut in respite care was one example of how the Government treats some of our most valued people and it has continued that trend ever since. County Donegal has the highest number - over 4% - of elderly people living in the community. This is because the HSE in Donegal, to its credit, has supported home care and home care packages. This is the model which should be rolled out across the country because it removes the dependency on nursing home care rather than increasing dependency. It is also more cost-effective and less expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> The process will require an individual making a complaint seeking to resolve the dispute with the nursing home in the first instance. The Ombudsman has announced that there will be information sessions for private nursing home owners. However, an information campaign should also target residents of private nursing homes and their families as this legislation deals with very vulnerable people. How can we ensure that vulnerable persons are empowered to speak up against an authority if they do not know their rights and entitlements? Many people are not aware of their fundamental entitlements. They may not be aware of due process and procedure and this is a real concern. Literacy issues when dealing with bureaucracy and a full understanding of how to work around bureaucratic systems has led to numerous breaches of service provision. How are we to empower people to understand the role of the Ombudsman and their ability to access this resource? Will the Office of the Ombudsman be resourced to cater for a rise in the number of complaints that could be received due to this greater awareness? It is important to note the high rate of cases discontinued prematurely and not being upheld. We must ensure that the resources are available to the office to deal with the cases.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_647">I welcome this Government decision which is a good news story. It will make a fundamental change in the way our elderly people are treated and how mistreatment of the elderly will be dealt with. There is a crisis of care in this country, in particular, with regard to our most vulnerable people such as children, people with disabilities or elderly citizens. A society is measured by how it looks after those who are weakest and most vulnerable and in that regard we have serious issues that need to be dealt with. HIQA is exposing many of the inadequacies of many of our public institutions and, hopefully it will now deal with private institutions as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> I believe there is a significant and real deficit in our system. While this motion is welcome it will not necessarily be the complete answer. The love and the care that families bestow on their relatives who are being cared for in any of these institutions is fantastic. I applaud their humanity, their concern and their dedication. They do their very best to look after the most vulnerable of our citizens. I also compliment the staff in institutions for their compassion and their personal dedication to their work. Nevertheless, over 700 complaints have been recorded in the private nursing homes sector. Not all of them are equally bad but many of them are appalling, disgraceful and shameful instances. The complaints include physical, financial and verbal abuse as well as sexual abuse. Very vulnerable people are dying in appalling and disgraceful circumstances. As the Minister of State acknowledged in her contribution, the problem is that HIQA cannot investigate those individual complaints. I gave all those complaints to the Garda Síochána and hopefully these are being investigated. However, when I contacted the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais, I was informed that these bodies cannot investigate those complaints because any complaint must include the name of the nurse or doctor involved. This must be changed so that where a complaint is made to the Ombudsman he can insist that the complaint be investigated by the Medical Council or An Bord Altranais, where applicable. </p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The Minister of State is aware of a case and I acknowledge her interest and that of her staff in it. Those involved in the case have been told that if they want to make a complaint they must provide the name of the nurse who may have abused the patient concerned. The complaint will not nor cannot be investigated until the name is provided. Notwithstanding the changes to the Ombudsman Act, there are significant other circumstances pertaining which still be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> My concerns are serious and they relate to specific circumstances. They are administrative concerns if one can call this an administrative decision. I refer to three very vulnerable adults in the later stages of their lives, needing high level care for a terminal illness or who are not far from passing from this world. They were moved from a ward where they had been loved and cared for, in one case, for more than 12 years. The ward was closed down and they were moved. It was recommended that they should go to a particular private nursing home where the care would cost €210,000 for the three persons per annum. Somewhere in the system the decision was made not to transfer those vulnerable people to that institution of care which was deemed to be the best for them. Instead they were moved to a different ward in the HSE institution and where two of them died. These deaths are being investigated. I understand the Minister of State's Department is aware of their deaths and is aware of the concerns of the families. It is an appalling situation. When the coroner for Dublin heard the case in his court, he wrote to convey the concerns of the families to the hospital concerned. The letter was acknowledged but nothing happened. The letter went into the bin. People die because of administrative decisions. It is a shameful and disgraceful situation. I know the Minister of State is committed to examining this case and I await the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> I regret this debate is so short but I am very happy that the changes for which I have campaigned are happening. I will raise with the Minister of State and in this House the outcome of these investigations which are about to commence. It is time for radical change. Our care system needs to be radically overhauled.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. Deputy O'Dowd has taken a particular interest in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I know that everyone has an interest in ensuring that, as we age, we are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> One of the aims of the Civil Service renewal plan, launched by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, last October, is to have a unified, professional, open, accountable and responsive Civil Service. This means that its culture, structure and processes change so that it becomes more agile, flexible and responsive. The order before us seeks to extend such responsiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> We all want our public services delivered in a way that is responsive to the needs of our citizens and produces the best overall outcome. By approving this order, we are further moving in this direction. We are affording some of our most vulnerable citizens the opportunity to access the services of the Ombudsman. The function of the Ombudsman is to investigate complaints from members of the public who believe they have been unfairly treated by certain public bodies. Public bodies whose actions may be investigated by the Ombudsman included all Departments, the HSE, including public hospitals and health agencies providing services on behalf of the HSE, and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The Government, through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, introduced the most substantial extension in both the powers of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman's remit in more than three decades and thereby significantly enhanced the accountability of public bodies to citizens. The 2012 Act strengthened the Ombudsman's powers in several important areas and also provided the legal framework to strengthen the relationship between the Ombudsman and the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> The additional bodies that were added to the Ombudsman's remit under the Act include third level education institutions in receipt of public funding, education and training boards, the National Roads Authority, the fisheries boards and the Courts Service. This major expansion in access of members of the public to the Ombudsman further strengthened the standing of citizens in their dealing with public bodies, ensuring that fair treatment is always provided, as well as improving the quality of decision-making and increasing accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> The introduction of this order will mean that for the first time this accountability and assurance will be afforded to residents of private nursing homes who are in receipt of State funding or subvention. The independent redress delivered by the Ombudsman will mean an additional level of support for these residents and the opportunity to access an outside authority. </p>
          <p eId="para_659"> This is part of the Government's programme of wide-ranging reform aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public system to help rebuild trust in Government and in the institutions of the State. This extension of the Ombudsman's remit follows on from our commitment in the programme for Government to extend the Ombudsman's remit to include non-public bodies which are significantly funded by the State. In addition, it is in keeping with the scope of the Ombudsman which has always been focussed on the delivery of publicly funded services. </p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Deputy Pringle spoke about older people, some not so old, who are resident in private or public nursing homes. They will also have access provided that a significant element of public funding is going into it. It is the significant public funding that is important and the access flows from that, which is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_662">Yes. In addition I know that there was concern over how people would know about this. I say this with all due deference. It is not as if people in nursing homes are watching Sky News all day long. I have been in enough of them to know that even though they may be very interested, that does not happen. The Ombudsman's office will undertake a publicity campaign on this. If the people in the long-stay nursing homes do not get the information, I am convinced their families, their loved ones and those who support them will.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> In addition the Ombudsman will deliver the service from within existing resources.

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_668">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_669">In page 3, line 7, to delete “Act,” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_670">“Act; to provide for court review of proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangements in certain circumstances; to amend the eligibility criteria for Debt Relief Notices; to further provide for the regulation and supervision of personal insolvency practitioners;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Amendment No. 1 is to amend the Long Title of the Bill. It takes account of the further amendments that I will be tabling to provide for a court review of proposed personal insolvency arrangements to increase eligibility threshold for debt relief notices and to improve regulatory and supervisory functions of the Insolvency Service of Ireland regarding personal insolvency practitioners. Amendment No. 3 provides for the change to DRN thresholds.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Deputies will recall that the Government announced a new strategy for tackling the mortgage arrears situation in May this year, in particular for dealing with those who are in chronic long-term mortgage arrears. A flagship element of this strategy is to introduce a new facility whereby a personal insolvency arrangement, which has been rejected by creditors under the arrangements in place at present, can be brought in certain circumstances to the Circuit Court for review and, subject to the tests set out, the court may decide to impose the rejected arrangement on the parties. This will present new options and hope to those borrowers who have under present arrangements run out of road. We will discuss this further in due course when the amendments to introduce this are moved.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> The second major element of what is being proposed is to strengthen the regulatory powers of the Insolvency Service of Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs. This will increase confidence among debtors, creditors and other stakeholders that the Insolvency Service of Ireland has the full suite of regulatory powers necessary to oversee PIPs who, as we know, play a key role in the insolvency resolution processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I will come shortly to the third element which is, as proposed under amendment No. 3, to increase the threshold for eligibility for a debt relief notice from the current limit of €20,000 to €35,000. This has been requested in a number of quarters and will again bring a number of people, who would not qualify under current limits, to the possibility of a DRN which applies to those who have little or no income or assets but have accumulated amounts of debt which they have little or no hope of being able to pay in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> In tandem with these new measures, the Government is working intensively, in a way which is co-ordinated across all relevant Departments and agencies, in delivering on the wider elements of the mortgage arrears initiative including arrangements to deliver assistance and advice through MABS and ISI in the courts when repossession actions are taking place; enhanced and expanded arrangements for mortgage to rent; and a nationwide information and publicity campaign aimed at getting those in serious mortgage arrears to engage with their lenders and with the courts where repossession proceedings have been initiated, coupled with an undertaking that, when they engage, co-ordinated services will be there to assist them.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> These measures are being implemented across the system currently and everything will be in place and operational by September. Obviously, if the House approves the amendments I am tabling, including the measure for a court review of personal insolvency arrangements rejected by the banks, they also will be up and running in the next period.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Amendment No. 3 is to increase the upper limit of qualifying debts for debt relief notices under the Personal Insolvency Act. A debt relief notice, DRN, is a different debt settlement measure from a personal insolvency arrangement, which is the main focus of these amendments, but is also provided under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> It is aimed at people with very limited means, being limited to an insolvent person whose net disposable income after reasonable living expenses, which are defined, is less than €60 per month and who has assets of €400 or less, excluding basic household goods or tools, and a motor vehicle worth €2,000 or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Currently, the person’s debts may not exceed €20,000. </p>
          <p eId="para_680"> I am glad to say this amendment will widen the scope of debt relief notices, DRNs, under the Personal Insolvency Act by increasing the limit of the debt that may be subject to a DRN, from €20,000 to €35,000 per person. During the Department's review of the insolvency legislation the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and other organisations working with people in debt pointed out that the €20,000 limit included in the Act was overly stringent and excluded many indebted persons from returning to solvency. The amount of debt held by insolvent persons approaching the MABS to seek a DRN is commonly up to €35,000, which is the reason for selecting this figure which more accurately responds to real needs. The issue was also raised by Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn on Committee Stage who proposed an increase in the threshold to €30,000. The amendment will, I believe, open up the DRN solution to those who are not able to benefit from the other arrangements under the legislation. It will help people on very low incomes who do not own a property or significant assets and are weighed down by debts they cannot pay.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_686">In page 3, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_687">
            <b>“Amendment of section 9 of Principal Act</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_688"><b>2.</b> Section 9(1) of the Principal Act is amended by—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_689">(a) the substitution of the following for paragraph (e):</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_690">“(e) promote public awareness and understanding of matters relating to personal insolvency, and provide information on the working of this Act and of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, and on related matters including those specified in paragraphs (jb), (jc) and (jd);”,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_691">and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_692">(b) the insertion of the following after paragraph (ja) (inserted by section 38 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013):</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_693">“(jb) compile, collect, analyse and disseminate information and statistics on the operation of this Act and of the Bankruptcy Act 1988;</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_694">(jc) monitor and analyse developments, as respects, the situation of insolvent debtors, and trends in, and patterns of, debtor and creditor behaviour;</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_695">(jd) develop strategies for communicating with the public aimed at promoting the use of insolvency arrangements and enhancing their effective application;”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Amendment No. 2 is to section 9 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which sets out the functions of the Insolvency Service of Ireland. It expands on the important functions of the service regarding information, awareness-raising and communication in personal insolvency and bankruptcy matters. </p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Paragraph (a) gives the Insolvency Service of Ireland explicit powers to promote awareness and understanding of insolvency and bankruptcy legislation. In that regard, I should acknowledge the proactive approach to public information the service has been taking nationwide. Research undertaken by it last year showed that many people in serious debt were not aware of the services available to them through it. The amendment underlines the importance of public awareness as a crucial step in responding effectively to problem debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Paragraph (b) further strengthens the role of the Insolvency Service of Ireland in developing and maintaining expertise in relation to the operation of the Personal Insolvency and Bankruptcy Acts and monitoring and analysing developments in debtor and creditor behaviour. These functions will ensure the existence of a national expert authority on insolvency and bankruptcy and its availability, where required, in policy development and decision-making. Paragraph (b) focuses on development by the ISI of communication strategies to promote the use of insolvency arrangements and enhance their effectiveness. This function lies at the heart of my amendments to the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Amendments Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, provide for a more detailed and effective power for the Insolvency Service of Ireland to exercise a proactive supervision over personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs. The Act already provides extensive powers for the ISI to intervene where there is a complaint, or where there is some reason to suspect that a PIP has not correctly fulfilled his or her duties under the Act. It is a reactive power, carried out by inspectors whose functions and powers are already provided in the Act. However, it does not provide for a proactive supervision power which would allow for routine inspection without need for a reasonable apprehension of misconduct. This sort of proactive supervision power reflects what is already the case for legal and accountancy professional bodies or debt advisors supervised by the Central Bank. It represents a "good practice" standard and the ISI has requested such an extension of its powers for that reason. It is very important, given the trust placed in PIPs to administer the funds of insolvent persons and fulfil statutory duties both to creditors and debtors, that they enjoy the fullest public confidence. I consider it appropriate that the ISI should have such a detailed power. The Act already provides a general supervisory power for the ISI in section 9 and amendments Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, will now translate it into detailed application by providing for the appointment of authorised officers who will carry out the proactive supervision function and conferring on them the necessary powers. </p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Amendment No. 22 provides for a stronger definition of “improper conduct” in respect of authorised officers and extends ISI powers to supervise and investigate the conduct of PIPs in respect of a more comprehensive range of breaches of the Personal Insolvency Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Amendment No. 23 inserts sections 176A to 176D, inclusive, to the Act of 2012. Section 176A provides the ISI with a new supervisory function to ensure PIPs comply with their statutory obligations. This is an important provision. It is in line with current regulatory best practice and in the public interest. Currently, insolvency legislation only provides for investigations in response to complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> I want to ensure there is full public confidence in PIPs and the important services they deliver. For example, PIPs hold money for the person in an insolvency arrangement and pay out that money to creditors. A proactive supervisory function will also be a protection for PIPs. Section 176B deals with the appointment of authorised officers to carry out supervisory functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> Section 176C addresses the powers of the authorised officer to pursue his or her responsibilities. The powers are standard and found elsewhere in the Statute Book and reflect the important nature of the functions of PIPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> Section 176D requires an authorised officer, where improper conduct by a PIP is found to have occurred or is occurring, to notify the ISI of that conduct. Section 176D also requires the ISI after such notification to have an investigation carried out where there is sufficient reason to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Amendment No. 24 amends section 181 of the Personal insolvency Act 2012 which deals with measures to assist an inspector in carrying out an investigation of a PIP. In general, the new authorised officer powers reflect those already available to inspectors under the Act. However, in a few cases a new power, reflecting current best practice standards for supervision, has been included for authorised officers. The amendment extends these extra powers also to inspectors as they are also relevant for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> Amendment No. 25 amends section 186 of the Act of 2012 which deals with restrictions in relation to the Data Protection Act 1988 and extends the same protection to authorised officers as already applies to inspectors under the Act.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_715">“(2A) Where a Debt Relief Notice, a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement as outlined in the Principal Act is rejected by a majority of creditors, this information will be included in the Annual Report of the Insolvency Service of Ireland.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I have resubmitted this amendment which was tabled on Committee Stage. This is a new authority in respect of which there were many issues in the primary legislation. We are back today to work out the teething problems. One of the big lessons we have learned in listening to people in our clinics and reading the newspapers and I learned when I attended a sitting of the Circuit Court in Limerick on a home repossession day concerns the absence of public information on the workings of and the service provided by the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Every opportunity should be taken to make information available to the public. First, there is a challenge to let the public, particularly those who are in financial distress, know the Insolvency Service of Ireland is available to help them. Second, for those who are aware of that, we need to let them know about its processes and how it works. The amendment states: "Where a Debt Relief Notice, a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement as outlined in the Principal Act is rejected by a majority of creditors, this information will be included in the Annual Report". This would go a long way towards providing that information to the public and would help create debate, which would help promote public awareness of the service that is available.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">I appreciate the intention of the amendment which seeks to ensure information about credit refusals is publicly available. However, given the recent changes, I do not believe the amendment is necessary or workable in its current form for the following reasons. As the Deputy is aware, since the first quarter of this year, the Insolvency Service of Ireland already publishes details, on a quarterly basis, of debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements which have been voted down by creditors. While the Deputy was calling for that information to be made available on an annual basis, it is now available on a quarterly basis and I understand more information will be published tomorrow by the Insolvency Service of Ireland. As the Deputy knows, there is also the annual report, which goes into huge detail on the DRNs and PRAs, the amount of debt that is being dealt with by the ISI, the number of bankruptcies and so on. Very detailed information is now available.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Debt relief notices would not fall to be included in the proposed amendment, since the Personal Insolvency Act does not provide for a creditor vote for this type of arrangement. As I explained when I was increasing the thresholds, the DRN is a limited write-down of unsecured debt for persons with very little income or assets which is approved directly by the court. A creditor can object to the court but no creditor vote is required because of the very specific and limited nature of this debt solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">The amendment is designed to remove a potential bar to some insolvent borrowers being able to make a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement and, therefore, to access the new court review under the Bill. It relates to people who were in mortgage arrears on their own homes and who have entered into an agreement to restructure their mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> Under section 91(1) of the Act, a borrower must first co-operate with the mortgage lender under the mortgage arrears resolution process approved by the Central Bank before he or she can make a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement. If the borrower does so but is not able to agree a restructure with the mortgage lender, he or she is then eligible to propose a personal insolvency arrangement. The question has arisen, however, as to eligibility where a borrower has co-operated with MARP and has entered a restructure, whether MARP or non-MARP, but the restructure has failed or is unsustainable, and the borrower remains insolvent.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> It is important that a borrower in this situation should be eligible to make a PIA proposal. This amendment clarifies that this is the case by explicitly adding that a borrower is eligible to propose a PIA if he or she has co-operated with MARP and has entered a MARP or non-MARP mortgage restructure, which he or she has tried in good faith to comply with but remains insolvent. Insolvency is confirmed simply by their personal insolvency practitioner confirming that the person remains insolvent and is unlikely to become solvent within five years without being able to avail of a PIA.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">We have engaged with some of the stakeholders around the Minister's amendments. We are concerned that the new wording, taken in conjunction with the proposal in section 13, will mean that those in restructured arrangements may not be eligible for a court review. The purpose of the amendments seems at first glance only to strengthen the hand of the banks in putting up another obstacle for the debtor to surmount. The unamended section does not mention restructured debt. By explicitly mentioning it, I fear its purpose could be to exclude rather than include. Additionally, given what the Central Bank's review has shown up in terms of the scandalous failure of banks to implement the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, I wonder whether that particular obstacle for a debtor is inherently unfair. It is said that we have to play by the rules but we know the banks have not been playing by them. We will listen to the Minister's explanation and we will discuss with our Seanad colleagues whether we may seek to amend this Bill in the Seanad.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I want to deal with this point that they may not be eligible. In fact, that is a mistaken view as the Bill specifically protects people in mortgage restructures. It expressly provides a new section 115A(18)(b), inserted by amendment No. 13, whereby access to the new court review is available for a person who was in mortgage arrears on his or her home at any point before 1 January 2015 but has entered a mortgage restructure of those arrears. If the restructure has not restored the person to solvency, he or she can propose a PIA. Section 91 of the Act is also amended at amendment No. 5 to ensure there is no possible bar to this being done. If the PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the person can apply for a court review of the rejection in accordance with the new section 115A of the Act. I hope that explains that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">I move amendment No. 6:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_741">In page 13, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_742">
            <b>“Amendment of section 95 of Principal Act</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_743"><b>11.</b> Section 95 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (5) by the deletion of “section 113(2)” and the substitution of “sections 113(2) and 115A(5),”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I am pleased to propose this group of amendments, which contains at amendment No. 13 the new provision for independent review by the courts where a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement, including arrears on the borrower’s home mortgage, has been refused by creditors. This follows the Government’s decision on 13 May on increasing support for borrowers in mortgage arrears on their homes and especially for those at risk of repossession. This is a key reform, designed to ensure fair and sustainable debt deals are upheld for struggling borrowers who want to work their way out of debt with a view to keeping their homes. It will protect distressed mortgage holders and will provide a better balance between the interests of banks and of those facing unsustainable mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Amendment No. 13 contains the substantive provision for review, while amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 10 are consequential amendments. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 ensure that where a borrower applies for the new court review, he or she will remain protected by the protective certificate - a court order preventing enforcement action or pressure by creditors - pending the determination of the review. Amendment No. 10 refers to the specific procedures for creditor approval that apply when there is only a sole creditor. In that case, no creditor meeting is required and section 10 ensures that where the sole creditor refuses the proposal, the borrower in that situation can also apply for the court review.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Amendment No. 13 sets out the provisions applicable to the review itself. Under the 2012 Act, a proposed personal insolvency arrangement is voted on by the creditors and must be approved by the necessary majorities of secured and unsecured creditors. If the creditors reject the proposal, however, there is no existing provision for a review or appeal. The new court review will change this situation. It will apply to proposed personal insolvency arrangements that have been vetoed by creditors where the debts include a mortgage on the debtor’s home which was in arrears on 1 January 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The objective of the new review is to help people who are in serious mortgage arrears on their family homes, particularly those who are at risk of repossession. Therefore, the review is available to a borrower who was in mortgage arrears on their home on 1 January 2015. It is also available if the borrower was in such arrears before that date, which have been restructured under a MARP or non-MARP restructure, but nevertheless the borrower remains insolvent, which is the point raised by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> The Government announced last May that its court review mechanism would be based on court examinership. The examinership concept is already tried and tested in the Irish courts and has been found to stand up constitutionally, which is a critical point.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">In examinership, the examiner must show some element of creditor support. Equally with this new measure, some element of creditor support is needed. However, this is a much lower and more flexible requirement than the test which currently applies, and it should be feasible in the large majority of cases. Moreover, it is important to note that the Bill also provides for a significant exception to the creditor support requirement. In many cases involving a mortgage, the borrower has consolidated their debts with the bank which is also their mortgage lender. This is a very critical point in terms of who has access to the review. The Bill provides that in these so-called sole creditor cases, if the sole creditor refuses the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, proposal, the debtor does not have to show any creditor support before seeking a court review. This effectively opens up the whole PIA process to a large number of cases where up to now, no PIA proposal has even been made as it was felt that the sole creditor would never agree to a deal offering statutory protection for the borrower.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> Under the existing provisions of the Act, only three classes of creditor can be looked to regarding PIA approval – secured, unsecured and overall debt – and all three of those classes must approve it by majority. In the new court review, as in examinership, the test is different. The personal insolvency practitioner has to show that there is majority support of over 50% from just one class of creditor, not three, and, more important, there is far more flexibility about what constitutes a class. It may be just one creditor or more than one creditor with some commonality of interest among them. It is not limited to the classes of overall, secured or unsecured debt. This flexibility will support finding a solution which is fair and reasonable for all concerned, as it does in examinership, and the court will ensure this test is applied fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> I underline that a key advantage of using an examinership approach is that, following extensive deliberation and legal advice, the Government believes this Bill is constitutionally robust in the very difficult legal territory of potentially providing for imposed solutions which could to an extent impinge on the rights of secured lenders. That legal security is vitally important for borrowers in mortgage arrears. In summary, this new review is a major reform which represents a groundbreaking shift from the current position and will significantly re-balance the position of creditors and debtors to ensure fair and balanced outcomes. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_756">Amendment No. 13 is the most important aspect as it deals with the infamous bank veto. After the Opposition repeatedly raised its concerns, we finally got a promise that the banks' veto would be scrapped. Is the veto gone? In some cases, it is subject to the courts, while in other cases it is not clear at all, from our interpretation.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> If someone falls into arrears after 2 January this year, the banks still have their veto. What is really being proposed is a temporary empowering of the courts in some circumstances to overrule a bank's veto if certain conditions are met. That is not what was promised as far as I am concerned. We believe the veto will remain in the majority of cases. We know how adept the banks are at getting their way. I have major doubts as to whether the solution will work for the vast majority of mortgage holders or others in debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> The Government has taken quite a while to come to this Stage and we are concerned that only those eligible for a personal insolvency arrangement, and not just a debt settlement arrangement, have any chance of appealing. We would like to get the Minister's response to those concerns, and we reserve the right to propose amendments in the Seanad if we cannot get assurance in respect of our concerns.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_276" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">

          <p eId="para_759">This is the first time a judge of the Circuit Court may, in specific circumstances, impose on lenders an insolvency arrangement which they voted down. That is a very important point to note. We are providing for a situation in which a borrower has only one creditor. I emphasised this point when I was introducing the amendment. Many people would be in that situation, with the bank having consolidated the loans and holding the mortgage. They can get the court review even if the one creditor is opposed to a deal. That is a very wide group of people As I have already said, we are raising the debt relief notice, DRN, limit from €20,000 to €35,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> When we announced the review in May, one of the key points I made - I have also made it this evening when introducing the amendment - is that it would be based on the court examinership model. If there is absolutely no creditor support in an examinership, it is not feasible. The examinership concept is tried and tested in the courts in terms of constitutionality, which is very important when we are talking about imposing a solution for creditors. With this new measure, if there is no vestige at all of creditor support, even potentially from one of the creditors, the procedure cannot be invoked. That is correct. It is the examinership model. As in examinership, the court may only impose the PIA arrangement in a new court review where there is some degree of support evident from at least 50% of one class of creditors. Under the existing provisions of the Act, only three classes of creditor can be looked to regarding the PIA, as I have said. I have gone into the detail of that. However, in examinership, not only is just one class required, there is far more flexibility about what constitutes a class.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> The measures are aimed at assisting people in long-term arrears. They are part of the overall Government strategy. The date of 1 January is there, and it is not intended to impact on new mortgages that have been taken out since that date. It is about targeting those people. Let us remember that 85% of people are paying their mortgages. We are talking about a group of people who have long-term arrears and who have not been able to come to a solution. In some instances, they have not made contact with banks and the agreements have been vetoed at the creditors' meetings. It is to deal with this particular group, which is the reason for the date of 1 January.</p>

This is an important point. Amendments Nos. 14 and 16 to 20, inclusive, are consequential amendments, while amendment No. 21 is a substantive amendment and keeps the same protection for debtors as in the existing variation provision.

However, this amendment is not necessary, as the Act already provides for a statutory review. Section 141 of the Act requires the Minister for Justice and Equality to carry out a full review of the operation of insolvency arrangements under the Act, including debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements, within three years of its commencement, namely, by 31 July 2016. The review is to be completed within one year and the resulting report laid before each House of the Oireachtas. We have already completed a review of the operation of the insolvency legislation, following the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, and most of the amendments I am tabling today are based on that review which was extensive in its scope. I hope for these reasons that the Deputy will consider withdrawing the amendment which would unnecessarily duplicate the review work for which the legislation already provides.</p>

          <p eId="para_1069">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1070">In page 11, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1071">“(10) A provider who is served with a non-compliance notice shall be liable to inspection by child protection staff of the Agency.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1072">(11) A provider who has been served with a non-compliance notice and has been on the register of non-compliance for 30 days consecutively or more may be liable to an offence and on summary conviction may be subject to a class B fine.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The amendment specifies that a provider who is served with a non-compliance notice should be liable to inspection by child protection staff of the agency. There seems to be an error. The amendment I submitted provided that the provider be liable to inspection by HIQA. The Bill also specifies that a provider who has been served with a non-compliance notice and has been on the register of non-compliance for 30 days consecutively or more may be liable to an offence and, on summary conviction, may be subject to a class B fine. We debated the measures at considerable length considerably on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> I welcome the main provisions of the Bill and, as I indicated on Second Stage and Committee Stage, my party will support it. It is long overdue and has been promised since the new Government came to office. While I should not call the Government "new" given that it is four and a half years into its term, it has taken four and a half years to bring the legislation to this point. It will put the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis, which will ensure anybody who has child welfare or protection concerns or who suspects abuse or neglect, will be legally required to report the concerns. Wherever children congregate, there will be a requirement that a child safeguarding statement be in place and on display. In the absence of sanctions and consequences for the failure to display a child safeguarding statement, it will not be robust enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> I looked back at a press release I released in 2014, when the heads of the Bill were published. The Government had previously published heads of the Bill in April or May 2012. At that stage, it was envisaged that there would be robust sanctions for failure to comply with Children First legislation, up to five years in prison. The Minister's Department, led by his predecessor, was ensuring such sanctions. We need to put sanctions in place. Without them, we will not achieve sufficient compliance with the legislation. I suggested providers be liable to inspection by HIQA because HIQA's independence is unquestioned and it has carried out much good work during recent years in inspecting nursing homes and other institutions. Nobody questions HIQA's reports, due to its independence. HIQA would also be well placed to exercise discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> When we discussed it on Committee Stage, one of the Minister's main concerns was the cost implications associated with my tow amendments. I do not know if we can, in all conscience, take cost into account regarding child welfare and protection. We must ensure we do not compromise the welfare or protection of children in any way. HIQA will be able to exercise discretion and target areas of greatest vulnerability, issue proportionate sanctions and examine the risks involved in non-compliant institutions. In the business world there are serious sanctions for failure to have a safety statement in place, for example on a construction site or in a factory. If it is appropriate to sanction a business for failure to publish a safety statement, it is appropriate to sanction various institutions which deal with the most vulnerable people in society, children. We should implement sanctions and make non-compliant providers subject to inspection by HIQA. I made the point on Committee Stage, and the Minister asked me to have it costed. I said the Minister would be better placed to do so, given that he had a full Department at his disposal. I would welcome his feedback on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1077">Section 12 allows the agency to establish and maintain a publicly available register of non-compliance. It also sets out the criteria by which a non-compliance notice may be removed from the register, namely, on receipt by the agency of a child safety statement or the agency being satisfied that the statement is no longer required. Amendment No. 1 proposes a new subsection (10) to provide that a provider who is served with a non-compliance notice is liable to be inspected by child protection staff of the agency. The new subsection (11), which is also proposed to be inserted by the amendment, provides for a criminal sanction for a provider of service which continues to be on the non-compliance register for longer than 30 days. I will address both these together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> I have been advised that in order to provide for a criminal sanction in a legally sound manner, the Bill would have to provide for very significant operational complexity, including the operation of an inspection regime. After detailed consideration of what an inspection regime would involve, it was decided not to include a criminal sanction. It is my Department's view that introducing an inspection regime would divert significant Child and Family Agency resources away from front line, core child protection work and, therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 1. I understand and share the Deputy's concern that there should be full compliance with the requirement, that providers of relevant services prepare and publish a child safeguarding statement. I expect parents will be a significant ally in this respect and I hope it will become the norm that parents demand that services attended by their children, in both public and private sectors, will, where required by the legislation, have a fully up-to-date child safeguarding statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> The matter will be kept under review and I will be prepared to revisit the issue if it transpires, following commencement of the legislation, that providers of relevant services fail to fulfil their statutory requirements. Until then, I cannot justify the significant diversion of resources from front line child protection work which would be required for the implementation of the Deputy's amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1080">The Minister's position has not deviated at all since Committee Stage. It is somewhat regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">I accept the Minister's point about how, at times of scarce resources, we must ensure the provision of adequate front-line services. In this case, however, it involves front-line services where children are being looked after and there is non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> I accept that the amendment provides for the child protection staff of the agency when it should be the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA. Has the Minister examined the possibility of extending HIQA’s remit to include this area? The authority has already proved it can exercise discretion, target areas of greatest vulnerability and issue proportionate sanctions at the same time without compromising scarce resources for front-line services. We must ensure the best allocation of the Department’s resources. I know the challenges it faces in providing an adequate number of social workers and affordable child care services, as well as many other constraints. However, the best way to ensure compliance is to clearly state there are consequences and sanctions for non-compliance. Until a child care service faces sanction for not having a child safeguarding statement publicised or up to date, this will not work. I am concerned that we are putting an additional onus on parents to ensure they monitor various institutions. If a safety statement was not produced on a building site or in a factory, management would be liable to face sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1083">No one is asking parents to monitor organisations. We are merely asking that they satisfy themselves that there is a child safety statement. If it is not in place, they should reconsider whether they should let their child attend that service or organisation. It is important to point out that there are over 25,000 organisations involved. The burden of the Deputy’s proposal would soak up a significant amount of available resources, not just of money but also personnel, even for an organisation such as HIQA. We are not asking parents to monitor the situation but to satisfy themselves that, as one mark of a facility’s or service’s quality, there is a child safety statement. If there is not one in place, it should lead them to ask further questions about the appropriateness of that organisation, facility or service for their child. If reported to the agency, it will take action regarding the register of non-compliance. I have also given an undertaking to keep the matter under review. If I find it is not operating in a safe and satisfactory fashion, we will revisit the issue. In the first instance, however, the approach we have taken is proportionate and reasonable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1084">I accept the Minister’s bona fides in this regard. He has undertaken to review the provision in the future if it is not working satisfactorily. However, that goes for all legislation. The reason we are putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis is we believe they are not working adequately and want to ensure there is a legal requirement to ensure their implementation. By virtue of this, we are acknowledging the current system is not fit for purpose and want to improve the <i>status quo</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> Parents can satisfy themselves on the standards applied in, say, a crèche. However, what happens if its safeguarding statement is out of date? What happens if it is published one month but not subsequently? If a crèche is reported as a consequence, the Minister considers it is appropriate enough to name and shame rather than have meaningful sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> The proposal to introduce tough and robust sanctions came from the Department under the then Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in 2011 when the legislation was first proposed. The proposed sanctions included up to five years’ imprisonment. Why has there been such a change in the intervening period?</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> The Minister has claimed this provision will be under review. There will be an election in eight months. Without wishing either of us ill luck, who knows if we will be back in this House? With all due respect, a personal undertaking is not worth the paper on which it is written. If this does not work, how we can ensure child care facilities will become subject to investigation by HIQA and face sanction?</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1089">In page 14, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1090">“(13) A mandated person may be held guilty of an offence if he or she is required to report concerns or allegations of abuse to the Agency under <i>subsections (1) </i>and <i>(2) </i>and fails to do so subject to <i>subsections (3) </i>and <i>(4)</i>. A mandated person guilty of an offence will be liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">Unfortunately, we have a litany of legacy issues where people in positions of authority ignored the physical abuse of minors in their care and moved predators from one jurisdiction to another. Some of them held kangaroo courts to try to administer justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">This provision should apply to everybody, whether he or she is in a position of authority or an ordinary citizen on the street. Knowing what we now know about what happened in the Church, swimming clubs, schools, youth clubs and various organisations across the State, we have a responsibility to those who have been abused to ensure we will take all necessary precautions in order that no minor will have to suffer at the hands of an evil predator or suffer neglect or abuse. Someone should never be able to say he or she had concerns, but that Paddy or Johnny was an upstanding member of the community and that that alleviated him or her of responsibility. There must be a requirement that if someone has concerns, they be reported to the appropriate authorities to ensure they will be checked to see whether they are justified. Learning from past experience and past mistakes, it is not something that should or can be left to chance. There should be tough sanctions and consequences for those who knowingly and willfully flaunt regulations and ignore their moral duty to ensure a child is protected. Anyone who knowingly and willfully ignores the welfare and protection of a child is just as bad as the person who abuses or neglects a child. Such a person should also face consequences and sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> I genuinely appeal to the Minister to reconsider accepting the amendment because it is in the best interests of all children that it be accepted. It would improve the Bill which I acknowledge is good, but there are small areas where we can improve it. We are working together on a cross-party basis in the interests of promoting child welfare and protection and this is an area in which improvements could be made to the Bill. I, therefore, ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">Section 14 provides that certain professionals and other persons in specified occupations, as listed in Schedule 2, are mandated persons for the purposes of the Bill. The section sets out the circumstances where a mandated person is required to make a report to the Child and Family Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> Amendment No. 2 proposes to impose a criminal sanction on a mandated person who fails to report concerns or allegations of abuse to the Child and Family Agency. Taking legal advice into account and the need for a reasonable and proportionate approach, it was decided that it was unnecessary to impose a criminal sanction on a mandated person in the overall context of meeting the policy objectives of the proposed legislation. There were very serious concerns that unfounded and misplaced fears of attracting a criminal sanction would result in over-reporting and thereby place the child welfare and protection system under even more pressure. Some low level or inappropriate reporting could have the unintended consequence of delaying the prioritisation of higher risk reports if the ability to process reports was compromised. International comparisons indicate that this, in fact, has been the case in other jurisdictions. For example, in New South Wales the introduction of mandatory reporting precipitated a large increase in reporting rates but with little or no improvement in child protection overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> There are a number of administrative sanctions or consequences available if it transpires that a mandated person has failed to comply with his or her statutory obligations. The option to report a mandated person to his or her employer or the fitness to practise committee of his or her professional regulatory body remains open to the Child and Family Agency in a case where it transpires that a mandated person has failed to make a report. The Bill includes a link to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. The Child and Family Agency will be a scheduled organisation under that Act and in cases where a mandated person has failed to make a report, the agency, following an inquiry, will pass this information to the National Vetting Bureau.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 makes provision for the reporting of relevant information to the Garda. This legislation will operate in tandem with this Bill, when enacted. A person who fails to report to the Garda under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 could be subject to criminal sanction. I envisage opportunities for administrative arrangements to support the implementation of the legislative requirements; for example, mandated reporting should be incorporated into codes of conduct and contracts of employment for relevant persons. As things stands, many providers of children's services consider a failure to report to be a disciplinary matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> For these reasons, I am not accepting amendment No. 2. However, as stated previously, I will be keeping the operation of the Act under review and if it transpires that mandated persons are failing to comply with their legal obligations to report, I will be prepared to revisit the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1099">I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. I thought he would accept the amendment in the spirit in which it was submitted, that is, to improve the Bill. He talks about the members of many professions being subject to disciplinary action, but that is not something one can say for definite with authority across all professions. He also talks about the withholding of information, but he will be aware that that legislaton only deals with very serious criminal offences. He talks about the National Vetting Bureau. Despite the fact that that legislation was enacted over 18 months ago, it has yet to be commenced. Therefore, I am not confident that these two pieces of legislation will deal with all of the issues with which we want to deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> The amendment seeks to ensure that in all matters to do with child welfare and protection, if there is serious concern that a child is being abused or neglected, a person would make the necessary report to the Child and Family Agency. Perhaps it might place additional requirements on the services of the Child and Family Agency, but I would much rather see additional requirements being placed on the agency than a scenario, as happened in counties Laois and Offaly, where files would be left to one side. In that instance reports were made but not acted on for a number of years. That is why the Minister had to provide additional support from outside the area. When it comes to child welfare and protection, we cannot be complacent. We must bring forward extremely robust legislation. It was the Minister's Department which proposed to bring forward these sanctions in 2012. I am only following through on what it wished to do three years ago.</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_313" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1101">I have already given the Deputy an international example where what he proposes in this amendment hugely increased the workload of the agency concerned without any benefit to children. If an extra burden can be placed on an agency which is to the benefit of children it is something we would not shy away from doing. However, it has been proven internationally, in the case of New South Wales in Australia, that it does not yield any benefit but merely makes more work because people, paranoid about criminal sanctions, report anything and everything lest they be exposed. The Deputy acknowledged that in Laois-Offaly the issue related to a different problem altogether. There was not a problem with the reporting but a failure to deal with the reports in a way that had been agreed via protocols. The issue has been handled by the agency in a very urgent fashion and the chief operations officer, Mr. Fred McBride, has taken personal responsibility and control of the situation and has done similarly in Louth-Meath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> We are listening to people. The Deputy points out again and again that my predecessor and the Department spoke about an approach not unlike the one he is proposing but they have taken the time to consult and have learned that this may not be the best way forward and could even be counterproductive. We have left ourselves a safety valve in that, if we find our approach is not working, we will review and revisit the situation. We will keep it under review as I believe child safety is everybody's responsibility and I know all Deputies have child safety and protection to the forefront of their minds. They want to see that our children are safe and can enjoy their childhood, that they are well connected, protected and involved in contributing into the future.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Minister cites the example of New South Wales but there are many other jurisdictions, such as in Canada and in the United States of America, where sanctions are in place and where, having brought legislation in without sanctions, they later added sanctions. I referred to these places during the Second Stage debate last year, though it was the Minister's predecessor who was in the House at that time. There is always an international experience that can justify the case one wishes to put but, as the Minister confirmed on Committee Stage, the big issue is resources. Tusla, the new, stand-alone agency which was set up specifically to deal with prevention, early intervention and the welfare of children is not adequately resourced and has not been adequately resourced since its establishment. There are not sufficient front-line staff in social work and that is the real reason we are not bringing forward sanctions for people who fail to report. The agency is not fit for purpose in terms of being adequately resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> There are areas internationally where there are sanctions for non-reporting and, given the number of inquiries and reports there have been down the decades, we have a responsibility to ensure this never happens again. One of the ways to make sure it never happens again is to hold people accountable who knowingly and wilfully turn a blind eye to cases of abuse and neglect. This legislation gives us an opportunity to make those people face the rigours of the law with sanctions for failing to carry out their moral obligation. It was always their moral obligation to report these things.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105"> Standing Orders allow that the final contribution of the proposer of an amendment can speak without time limit and the Minister should not be worried about the time limit. He should be more worried about ensuring we get this right. We have been waiting for this legislation for four and a half years and it was promised when the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established. We are now in the last week of a Dáil term before an election and it is being rushed through with a guillotine. I do not mind the guillotine because there are only four amendments but we should thrash out those four amendments. I accept that we have a difference of opinion but this amendment should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> The things to which I refer are not in the distant past and are not just legacy issues but are happening now. People in positions of authority fail to live up to their moral obligation and when they do that there should be a legal obligation. If they fail to live up to their legal obligation there should be consequences for those people. I am pressing this amendment as it is worthy of consideration. I am disappointed the Minister has not taken it in the spirit in which it was intended.</p>

          <p eId="para_1192">I move amendment No. 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1193">In page 23, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1194">“5. Occupational therapist registered in the register of members of that profession.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">I signalled my intention on Committee Stage to bring forward an amendment to include occupational therapists as one of the classes of mandated persons under Schedule 2. Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage an amendment was agreed specifically to include as classes of mandated persons speech and language therapists and physiotherapists rather than a general inclusion of all potential registrants under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. It had been suggested to me that occupational therapists should be included as mandated persons as well due to their engagement with children, in particular children with disabilities. I agree with the suggestion and accordingly I propose the amendment to Schedule 2 for this purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_1196">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1197">In page 24, line 20, after “1991” to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1198">“including a person taking care of one or more children (other than that person’s own such children) in that person’s home, but not including any such person who is a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such relative”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The Children First Bill 2014 is one in a raft of measures designed to further child protection. I acknowledge the Minister's predecessor left the post having done much of the preparatory work and I have no doubt she will very much welcome the fact that we are seeing the Children First guidelines placed into legislation as a result of several years of pressing. Other Bills that come into this particular gamut of legislation include the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act from the same year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> The main measure of the Children First Bill 2014 requires that mandated persons report concerns they have, matters that might present or arise in the course of their roles and functions in society, to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. It also aims to improve compliance. As I said, the former and first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs sought to place the Children First guidelines into legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> Deputy McLellan and I, as the former spokesperson for children and youth affairs for Sinn Féin, have a concern with the section relating to mandated persons. In particular, we see a problem with the listing as it appears in Schedule 2 and the sentence which specifies that a mandated person includes: "A person carrying on a pre-school service within the meaning of Part VIIA of the Child Care Act 1991." Let us refer back to the Child Care Act 1991. It makes reference to childminders caring for four or more children, other than their own, but it exempts absolutely childminders caring for three or fewer children, other than their own. The amendment, developed by Deputy McLellan, seeks to amend the text to include explicitly all childminders caring for three or fewer children, or rather, those caring for one or more, but to exclude relatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202"> I raised this in the course of Committee Stage and the Minister will remember that we had an exchange on the matter. I appeal to the Minister again in this regard. I believe it is critical that this comprehensive legislation is as holistic as it can possibly be and that all settings where children are placed, including childminder settings of whatever hue or variety, are absolutely catered to by this legislation. I do not believe it should be down to a numerical count of the number of children. If children are placed in a childminder setting other than their home, irrespective of whether there are one, two, three, four or more children, the reality is that the protections this legislation provides must apply to all and each. This is why we are pressing the amendment and I hope the Minister accedes to the proposition at this stage.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_317">

          <p eId="para_1203">I support my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, who has moved the amendment on behalf of Deputy McLellan. It is important that childminders are explicitly included. We talk about being consistent in our legislation. By virtue of the previous amendment, the Minister took the view that there was a need to include occupational therapists and specify occupational therapists in this legislation. This, of itself, justifies the need to specify childminders clearly and explicitly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> There is in the region of 50,000 childminders in operation in this State. It is a totally unregulated sector that has been unregulated in the past. I acknowledge that is not only the responsibility or a consequence of this Government. Anyway, the sector remains unregulated. When the national vetting legislation was going through - the Minister alluded to the vetting legislation previously - we tabled amendments to include childminders. At the time, the Government voted down the amendments to include childminders. As I said, at a conservative guess there are 50,000 childminders working in this jurisdiction, our State. They are dealing with children on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">Many of them are non-relative childminders and many of them are dealing with children numbering more than three. It is imperative that we refer to childminding explicitly in the legislation. As I stated, good legislation must be consistent. Given that the Minister has referred explicitly to occupational therapists, I would expect him to follow suit with this amendment and refer explicitly to childminders.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_318" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1206">Schedule 2 lists professions or occupations for the purpose of specifying classes of persons to be mandated persons in accordance with this Bill. Amendment No. 4 proposes to include a person taking care of one or more children in the home who is not a relative of the child. The categories of persons set out in Schedule 2 were included in the Schedule on the basis of their professional qualifications and their ongoing contact with children. The focus on a small qualified cadre of mandated reporters will, based on evidence, improve the quality of reports made to the agency. The receipt by the agency of better quality reports from persons who by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience are well equipped to recognise harm to a child is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessment of risk to a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> The list of mandated persons was developed following detailed consideration of both the objectives of the legislation and the research paper on how mandatory reporting is dealt with internationally. As already indicated, the persons included in the list have been selected on the basis that their qualifications, role and professional expertise mean they are aware of risks to children and their responsibilities in that regard. It is anticipated that reports from these persons are likely to be of high quality, and this will assist the agency in carrying out assessments of risk in a more effective and efficient manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208"> The childminding sector is not an homogenous one. A wide variety of arrangements, including personal family arrangements, pertain. In that context, it was considered overly onerous to impose a mandatory requirement on such an heterogenous group of providers. However, it is important to note that, while not required to do so under this legislation, any person can and should report any concern about a child to the agency in accordance with the Children First national guidelines, which will operate in tandem with the legislation. This position applies to childminders in addition to any other person who has contact with a specific child or children, whether in the context of service provision or otherwise. By comparison, the formal childminding sector, comprising crèches, will be covered by requirements relating to child safeguarding statements and mandated reporting. The Deputy's concern to protect this group of children should be alleviated by the fact that there are many other professionals in contact with this roup of children, including nurses, who are mandated persons, and also general practitioners. In this regard, the recent extension of GP medical cards to children under six should ensure greater contact between this group of children and their general practitioners, who are themselves mandated persons under the legislation. For these reasons, I am not accepting amendment No. 4.</p>

          <p eId="para_1209">I listened to the Minister's closing sentences. It is not about alleviating my concerns but about eliminating all of the circumstances in question. One should make no mistake about the fact that we will not get the chance to revisit this legislation in the foreseeable future if we are to exclude a reference to the childminder sector. The sector comprises a significant body of people right across the country who are providing daily care and oversight in respect of children in a variety of settings, but primarily the home of the childminder rather than the home of the child, although it is the latter in some instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> It would be a major omission not to include a reference to childminders and childminding. I know this is the view of a substantial number of voices in the non-governmental sector, who have lobbied strongly in this regard. We are very clear in the amendment, tabled by Deputy McLellan, that we are not talking about including a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such a relative. That is not the setting and the Minister made reference to that in his response. We are talking here about children unconnected to the provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> It is essential that we put into practice the oft-quoted reference within the Proclamation to cherishing all children equally. There can be no exceptions. If we allow this legislation to proceed without the inclusion of a reference to childminders, we will be failing abysmally. I will not be an obstacle to the passage of this legislation. It is important and I support it but it is deficient and will not have achieved all that it needs to and could achieve. These are the closing moments in which to ensure we pass on legislation that is truly worthwhile and inclusive. I urge the Minister again to reconsider the amendment in the name of Deputy McLellan.</p>

          <p eId="para_1212">I do not want to let the opportunity pass to respond to a statement made by Deputy Troy. He said the Child and Family Agency is not fit for purpose. I reject that because I believe it is. There will always be a case for more resources. I made it very clear that in the upcoming Estimates process I will fight for more resources for the agency. I expect that the agency will give me a good evidence-based business plan that will support its case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> With regard to Deputy Ó Caoláin's concerns, I have already made it very clear, in respect of our first two amendments, that we are to keep the operation of this legislation under review. If what we intend is not the result, we will revisit the areas that are required to be revisited. However, I do not expect childminders will comprise one of the issues to be revisited.</p>

          <p eId="para_1214">While I would love to be able to concur with the Minister, I am sorry I cannot. This setting could very likely present as one of real, current and topical concern, just as many such settings, both domestically and internationally, have been the focus of not inconsiderable concern and the focus of substantial sections of the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> Deputy Troy referred to some 50,000 children. I am not able to confirm that number but I have no doubt it is at least as great as that across this State. It is essential that we recognise it is not just about four or more children, as referred to in the 1991 Child Care Act. The first, second and third children, in any combination and as catered for in any of the childminding settings across this State, are equally deserving of the full protection of this legislation. They should be "children first" in equal measure. Again, I appeal to the Minister to address this. He is missing a real and important opportunity. Speaking of keeping the legislation under review and revisiting it in time is a very inadequate position to adopt. This is our time and I hope current Members of this House will be able to pass on to those who will follow us legislation that is truly fit for purpose and inclusive. That is why this amendment is before the Minister once again.</p>

          <p eId="para_1216">I support my colleague. This matter was debated at length on Committee Stage. It is regrettable that the Government is not taking the amendment on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The Minister puts forward an amendment to clearly and explicitly name occupational therapists. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the amount of work occupational therapists do with children is far less than the amount of work childminders do with children. Why does the Government fail to acknowledge a profession of people who work full time as childminders in their own homes? The Government refused to accept previous amendments tabled by my party in the Seanad and the Dáil that would have ensured that any person working as a childminder would have go through the vetting process. One would imagine that this would be only right and proper in the interests of the child and would protect the person minding the child. </p>
          <p eId="para_1218"> Here we have an opportunity, as Deputy Ó Caoláin noted, to get this legislation right. We have waited for it for four and a half years. The Department has brought it forward here this evening at the end of the Dáil term and there is an opportunity to get it right. The Minister has explicitly outlined occupational therapists. In the interests of consistency, if nothing else, why is he not taking this amendment on board?</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1306">calls on the Government to:</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1308">— provide the supports and services to assist people to continue to live in their own homes;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1318">— maintaining and enhancing rural community bus services.”</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">I propose to share time with Deputies John Halligan, Maureen O'Sullivan and Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> Over the past six years, changes in public services such as home help hours and community nursing units, reductions in the fuel allowance, cuts in the household benefit package, the abolition of the Christmas bonus and increases in prescription charges, as well as decreased front-line staff and services in the health care sector, have all adversely affected older people and have fallen very heavily on poorer groups without the income to compensate. In particular, the changes have affected poorer people with disabilities or illness. International experts have identified that spending on public health and on the over-65s will have fallen by approximately 32% between 2009 and 2016. Supports that enable people to live at home need to be part of a broader integrated approach that ensures appropriate access to and discharge from acute services when required. To achieve this, the specific deficits in infrastructure that exist across the country need to be addressed urgently. There should be an emphasis on replacement or refurbishment of facilities. If this is not done, the inappropriate admission of older people to acute care facilities will continue, along with the consequent negative effects on acute services and unnecessary stress on older people and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321"> A related issue is the shortage of appropriately resourced and staffed geriatric rehabilitation units. The National Clinical Programme for Older People 2012 recommends that every hospital receiving acutely ill older adults have a dedicated specialist geriatric ward and a designated multidisciplinary team as well as access to on-site and off-site rehabilitation beds delivering a structured rehabilitation programme for older people. This document recognises the fundamental right of an older person to receive an adequate period of rehabilitation before a decision on long-term care is made. Implementation of these recommendations is lacking and there continues to be a shortage of appropriately resourced and staffed geriatric rehabilitation units. The stated focus on the development of community-based services to support older people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible is welcome. However, an expert group described Ireland's under-resourced community health services as "perhaps the greatest deficiency in the current provision of health services in Ireland". A commitment to supporting people at home is only aspirational if funding is not provided for home help services, day care centres and home care packages, some of which have received serious and unwelcome cuts in recent budgets at a time when, on the contrary, they should have been the subject of investment to address population ageing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322"> Despite the steady growth in population, the public bed stock capacity has reduced significantly from a high of more than 10,000 beds in 2008 to a current capacity of 7,157 beds in 2014, which represents a 29% bed stock reduction since 2008. This is inclusive of a reduction in short-stay beds from a high of more than 2,000 to the current capacity of 1,868, an 11% reduction, and a reduction in long-stay beds from more than 8,000 to the current capacity of 5,289, a 35% reduction. In addition to the funding issues, HIQA requirements for the standards of long-stay accommodation have deemed certain facilities or parts of facilities to be unsuitable, and required reduced occupancy levels in others. This is a continuing issue for the sustainability of current levels of public bed provision. There has been some major and minor capital provision to address this issue, but not on a scale which would allow for the planned improvement or replacement of all facilities in need of upgrading.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323"> Support for people to remain in their own homes is a key and appropriate policy objective, and coincides with the wish of most older people. However, this commitment does not appear to be supported in practice when we note the significant decrease in the provision of home help hours in recent years, especially at a time of population ageing. Approximately 8,300 fewer people were in receipt of home help support in 2014 than in 2008, a decrease of approximately 14.5%. There was a decrease of 2.34 million in the hours delivered, a decrease of 18.5%. In the years after 2008 there was a steady decrease in the number of hours delivered and people receiving hours, especially from 2011, and although there has been a slight increase in 2014, both the number of hours delivered and those served by the scheme are still considerably less than in 2008 or indeed in 2011. During the period between 2008 and 2014, the number of people in receipt of home care packages grew by 4,200, representing an increase of 47%, but the funding for this scheme has remained static. The 2015 Health Service Executive national service plan envisages additional spending in this area, including on home care packages for 600 people, but also acknowledges the risk that the overall amount allocated for older people is not sufficient to address the dramatically increasing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324"> The 2011 programme for Government committed to implementing the national positive ageing strategy in order that older people could be supported and enabled to live independent lives, enhancing and protecting people’s well-being and quality of life. Unfortunately, four years on, this strategy has been neglected and has not been implemented in any shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> Four successive austerity budgets have greatly limited older people's ability to live full independent lives. Despite an 11% increase in the number of people aged 85 and over in the past three years, home help hours have not increased from the 2012 levels of 10.3 million hours and the present system is designed to see home help and home care as ways to meet the priority needs of supporting acute hospital discharges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326"> The failure to provide support to those in the community with low to medium needs has consequences in terms of demand for more intensive home care packages and long-term places for those with high dependency. More important, it denies older people the opportunity to live a full quality life. People are living longer with a growing population of people aged 80 and over and we need to plan to meet the increased demand for home help and home care services. These services give people, struggling at home, the skills to manage their daily lives, delaying the need for more intensive intervention and reducing the risk of admission to acute hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327"> The Government should consider introducing a national re-ablement programme, a model that has proved very successful in the UK. Re-ablement or restorative care programmes improve and maintain an individual's physical strength and mental health. They enable greater independence, reducing ongoing home support needs. An evaluation of a re-able pilot programme in north Dublin and research from other countries show a reduction in the need for home care hours. Participants, the majority of whom were aged 80 or older, had a 21% reduction in their requirement for home help and a further 59% reduction in the number of hours required. Councils in Britain that are implementing this programme found a reduction in the number of people being admitted to long-stay care. For example, in central Bedfordshire, numbers admitted to long-stay care fell by more than 10% over three years. The percentage of the population entering long-stay care per year in Britain is 0.7% compared with Ireland, where the number of new clients supported by the national system in 2013 stood at 1.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328"> The demand for long-term care beds is influenced by the availability of resources within the community. If the Government reneges on its commitment to meet older people's preferences for care in their homes, the number of long-term care beds required to meet demand naturally has to increase. Investment in home help and home care services is a priority. If the Government does not invest in these services, the alternative scenario is a more costly investment in the nursing home support scheme. Based on the assumption that 4% of the projected population of people aged over 85 in 2016 will require long-term residential care, this means there will be a requirement for an additional 1,056 beds at an estimated cost of €43.8 million. This clearly underlines the need for a substantial increase in funding for the aforementioned home care and home help strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">Over the past ten years, there has been a 44.6% increase in long-stay residents categorised as low dependency and a 17.6% increase in residents with medium dependency. These figures indicate that the effect of Government policy for long-term care provision is driving up the numbers of older people in long-term care who do not need to be there. In many cases people have been prematurely put into long-term residential care totally against their will. It is affecting their mindset and outlook and is demoralising in many respects. They would be better off in the community amongst neighbours and friends where they could visit the local shop or post office or go for a sociable drink with their friends. There is need for a total change in strategy and policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> Other countries take a home first approach. For example, in Ontario, Canada, patients are sent home with intensive case management and enhanced home care supports for several weeks. This frees up acute beds and ensures those with higher dependency care needs can get long-term care beds. This period of enhanced care supports also allows older people to see how well they manage at home, giving them the time and space to make a life altering decision about where they want to live long term, rather than making such a choice in a stressful and disorienting hospital environment. In the long term, this is a cost-neutral approach as the cost of the intensive case management approach used in Ontario is outweighed by the cost of acute hospital or nursing home beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331"> For approximately 58% of people aged 65 and over, the State pension is their only source of income. Older people receiving nursing home care under the nursing home support scheme must contribute 80% of their income, even though the scheme only covers basic bed and board. This leaves those on a full State pension with a disposable income of €46 per week. This is completely insufficient to cover everyday living expenses such as clothes and toiletries, chiropody, social activities and prescription charges among many more little items.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> I tabled this motion with a view to having a rational and logical debate to tease out many of the anomalies in the system. We could be much more cost effective: we have a lot of wastage and overspending. Instead, small amounts should be put into the right organisations and the State bodies which deliver community care. There are wonderful home help staff who are part of the jigsaw. Starting tonight, we should be more positive and enhance all the services. I hope we will have a fruitful discussion over the next two nights.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1333">Ireland currently has a ratio of six people to every older person. By 2045, that ratio will be three to one. To give just one example of life-changing conditions that affect the elderly, the number of dementia sufferers in Ireland is expected to almost triple to 140,000 in the next 25 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334"> Instead of putting into practice current policy, which according to the public service reform plan, pledges to "enable people to age with confidence, security and dignity in their home and communities for as long as possible", the Government has hacked away at services for older people since the recession began, to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro. This includes cuts to staff in hospitals and health centres, cuts in medical cards and the abolition of the telephone allowance. The number of home help hours has been reduced from 11.9 million in 2009 to 10.3 million in 2015 and provision of this service remains largely based on geography and available resources. I have seen the result time and again in the cases being handled in my office and know that where a person lives is a huge deciding factor in successfully securing home help hours. There was a high profile case in Waterford some time ago of an elderly lady whose breakfast and lunch were delivered at the same time because of the distance to where she lived and the lack of available carers to come to help her out. How undignified is that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> Furthermore, spending on the housing adaptation grant, housing aid for older people and the mobility aids grant, all invaluable in helping elderly and disabled people to continue living at home, have almost halved in recent years. Behind these facts and figures are real people being deprived of their dignity. By the end of this year, Government figures provided to me by the Department estimate that the nursing home support scheme will support just under 24,000 people in public and private nursing homes. Elderly advocate groups, however, believe one third of older people living in nursing homes could live at home, with the right supports. This is what we should be doing, as Deputy Tom Fleming said in his opening statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> At any given time it is estimated that at least 700 older people are occupying beds in hospitals while they wait to access a bed under this scheme. These patients, who are deemed "fit" for discharge, are often unhelpfully referred to as "bed blockers" in hospitals that are struggling to cope with huge backlogs. The price of a bed in an acute hospital is €850 per night. They would give anything to be able to sleep in their own beds but the supports are simply not there to allow them independently to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> Staff in nursing homes have told me that, after spending many weeks stuck mainly in a bed or chair in an acute hospital, elderly patients are often unable to walk by the time they get their places in nursing homes. At the root of this complete waste of public resources and unnecessary suffering by already frail elderly people is this Government's and the last Government's failure to plan for our aging population. Figures based on Department of Health records suggest that 35% of elderly people in long-term beds have "low to medium" support needs. It is the absence of proper supports in their community that is forcing many of these people into long-term nursing home care at an annual cost of €50,000 each to the State. It is estimated that nursing home care is three times more expensive than home help. Economically, the way we care for our elderly does not make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338"> Unless we change our approach and put in place statutory entitlement to home care for the elderly, as there is for nursing home support, the number of older people in nursing homes who could be supported to live at home will increase. Already, since 2003, there has been a 49% cent increase in the number of private nursing home beds. That is incredible. There is no doubt that if proper primary care supports were in place in the community, including home helps, home care packages, public health nurses, occupational therapists, day care centres and meals on wheels, many of these people would opt to return home. There is no question about that. The Government's approach is at variance with the stated policy of enabling people to "age with confidence, security and dignity in their home and communities for as long as possible". Economically, and to treat people with dignity, the policy needs to be dramatically changed over the next few years based on the statistics coming from the Government and the Health Service Executive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1339">We are all making our way through the seven ages of man as described by Shakespeare. It is fair to say that each age from childhood on brings its own joys but also frustrations and challenges so that by the time we reach that older age we have experienced a great deal. The majority of older people have worked all through their lives. They have paid their taxes and reared their children and many are now rearing grandchildren also. Many of them are the carers for family members with disabilities. I acknowledge the great voluntary work that so many older people have done throughout their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">I do not think there is a village, town or community in Ireland, urban or rural, that has not benefited from the huge array of voluntary work done by older people in the course of their lives. The expectation is that when they get to that older age, life should get easier, not much more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341"> It is very good that, tonight and tomorrow, thanks to Deputy Fleming's motion, we have an opportunity to talk about and highlight life for older citizens. To use the cliché, they are the unsung heroes of Irish life. However, there are glaring examples of where they are not treated appropriately. It is very sad to see senior citizens living in situations that do not afford them dignity, as I have seen in my own constituency in Dublin Central and I am sure it is the same in other constituencies. The loss of the Christmas bonus some years ago was a devastating blow, especially to those living in poorer circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> Sustaining independent living is very important, and part of that is keeping people out of nursing homes when there is no need for them to be there. This comes back to home care. In the community in which I live, East Wall, excellent home help care is available, mainly provided by local women. There is a great relationship between the carer and the person for whom they are caring. In so many cases, they are giving far more than the hours for which they are being paid. There is also very good community care in East Wall, with social events and outings organised by the community for seniors, and facilities and events in the day care centre. We also have very positive intergenerational exchanges with the local school and youth club.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> However, there are deficiencies in the home care area. There is no regulation of home care contracts. What we are seeing is a lot of privatisation, with agencies springing up. The agencies are good at the tendering aspect of presenting low cost care, but low cost care means lower paid care workers with poor conditions of employment. This is very particular to rural areas, where one carer may have to travel long distances from one client to another, with no travel expenses. All of that is impacting on the quality of care provided. Quality standards have to be in place to deliver quality care. Our seniors who need home care and home help deserve no less than those high standards. Therefore, one request is for home care services to be regulated. I am thinking in particular of three ladies I know who are well into their 80s and who, because they have support from home help and their families, are able to live in their communities in their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> I thank Age Action for the information in regard to the budget for this area. It notes that 72% of the budget is spent on nursing home support schemes, 14% on home help and 9% on home care packages. With a decline in funding for home help services and a decline in the number of home help hours, we know more people are being admitted to nursing homes who could stay in their homes. This is not an efficient use of resources, so something is wrong. I thank ALONE for providing the information that the proportion of older people in nursing homes in Ireland is 35% higher than in other EU countries and the second highest in Europe. This brings me to my point on the need for a statutory entitlement to more care, in the same way an older person needing long-term care has a right to State financial support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> Deputy Fleming mentioned "re-ablement". A pilot project carried out in north Dublin by the HSE had very positive results after the six-week programme in that people were able to stay in their homes and needed less home help support and fewer hours. What is needed is a serious look at the continuum of care so that needs are met as they arrive and also at how funding is allocated. ALONE tells us that one in three of those in nursing home beds could live in their communities. Its "Home First" campaign shows that one third of older people in long-stay beds have low to medium support needs. In addition, if the housing adaptation grant could be accessed more promptly, this could mean people staying in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> I mentioned my own community. The Minister of State will know it from his time teaching there that there are great facilities for older people in the Docklands area. However, I believe that loneliness is a major problem, sometimes in the cities but more particularly in isolated rural areas where there could be miles between one person and their nearest neighbour. The two venues that used to provide contact, support, friendliness and the personal touch - the pub and the post office - are under serious threat, with a number of closures, and we can add to that the closing of the rural Garda stations. All of this is contributing to feelings of insecurity, loneliness and isolation. While I am not advocating drink-driving, I doubt it was our senior citizens who were responsible for traffic and road fatalities. Nonetheless, when one social venue is removed, it needs to be replaced with another.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347"> Older people, either couples or individuals, may reach a point in their lives when their three-bedroom or four-bedroom home is more than they need. We should have a system where they can get out of that home and transfer into supported living. I receive frequent calls from elderly people living alone who have nobody to help them. Age Action is great at doing various jobs but there are some jobs that it cannot do without further support. To have senior citizens, in particular those with disabilities and those in various stages of dementia, coming into hospital accident and emergency departments is appalling. There is a need for designated intellectual disability nurses if we do not want senior people presenting at primary health care centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> We know the consternation that arose when free travel appeared to be under threat recently. Free travel is a contributing factor in the independence of the elderly and, for many, it is their sole means of getting around and getting to essential services and appointments. It is also a gateway to social life and visiting places and people. Of course, when older people avail of free travel, they spend money. There is discrimination against older people when it comes to car insurance. Older people, even those who have had no claims on their insurance policies all of their lives and are in very good health, can still find it next to impossible to get car insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> I hosted an Irish Food Writers Guild event on the health of the nation in the AV room in Leinster House today. One of the points made by the speakers concerned the relationship between food and health. Diet and nutrition are major killers in the developed world and, therefore, better eating is intrinsically linked to better health and well-being, with significant economic gains. The speakers called for the Government to revise food and health spending because better eating means improved lifelong health. They gave an example from Copenhagen of an older person's home for people with disabilities where a change in the diet, the food and the cooking meant fewer visits to doctors and hospitals, which meant savings. With increasing numbers of older people living longer, it is a challenge for the Government and succeeding governments. However, it points to the need to plan ahead. Yeats said this is no country for old men, but Ireland should be a country for old men and for old women because, at that stage - we will all get there, hopefully - we will need those supports.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T22:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1350">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important Private Members' motion on supporting our senior citizens. I thank and commend Deputy Tom Fleming for bringing forward the motion and I also thank all of the Independent Deputies who are supporting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351"> This is a very important part of the Independent vision for our country and, in this case, for our senior citizens, who have served the State so well. We all need to ensure that we have policies that are fair to senior citizens in order to maintain their dignity and independent living. The State has a duty of care for all of our people and our elderly have to be part of our society. I want a society built on social justice, on equality and respect and, above all, I want a society that puts the care of the elderly, a quality health service for all, and also for people with physical and intellectual disabilities, top of the political agenda. Tonight, in the Dáil, the Independent Deputies have proposed a plan to support our senior citizens. I call on all Deputies to support this motion in the vote tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> There are many excellent groups in this country which work with our senior citizens, including many in Dublin Bay north and across my own constituency that do magnificent work. However, the reality is they need and deserve our support. We also have to deal with the reality of what is happening in the country at the moment. Our population is aging rapidly and we are witnessing the most dramatic increase in population age in recent history. The current models are struggling to provide care for the older population and unless immediate action is taken to put in place long-term sustainable solutions, we are facing a major crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">It is envisaged that by 2026, there will be approximately 908,000 people aged 65 years and older, which accounts for 16% of the population. These are Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures. Currently, there are six working people to every one older person. By 2045, this will have changed to a ratio of 3:1. The cost of older persons' care is set to double to 1.8% of GDP by 2050. Every day over the next ten years, an additional seven older people in Ireland will require long-term residential care or home help. We need to plan and deal with the reality of what is happening at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354"> We also need to be brave and sensible when it comes to funding these projects. People ask where we will get the money from. They should just look at the Revenue report over recent days. An extra €44 million was taken in by Revenue following a trawl of wealthy individuals in recent weeks. This was ahead of the June deadline. There were only 137 cases but the average settlement was in the region of €320,000. Since they started this trawling a number of years ago, the Revenue Commissioners have raked in around €2.7 billion on 35,000 cases. That is a figure we will not hear in the broader society and I bring it up tonight in respect of funding for services. One in three people in nursing home beds could be supported to live in our community. We have the second highest number of over-65s living in nursing home care in the European Union. We have a dramatically ageing population. As I said before, 16% of the population will be over 65 by 2026. That is the reality of what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355"> We have two Ministers in the Chamber tonight. I call on the Government to implement a range of policies that are favourable to senior citizens to maintain independent living. I call on the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, to provide the supports and services to assist people to continue to live in their own homes. In light of the upturn in the economy, we should prioritise the household benefits package, including the electricity and gas allowance and the free television licence among other measures. We should continue to maintain the free travel scheme and the Christmas bonus. We should also ensure home help hours are maintained in line with demand in order that older people can age in their own communities. We should also invest in the Health Service Executive community care and community mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356"> These are the proposals we are putting on the table tonight. I also want the Government to commit to supporting older people to live a better life and in their own communities. We need to develop our primary and community care systems. We need to extend the fair deal scheme to include home supports. We need to increase home help hours and home care packages, which will also reduce costs. We need to support older people to move home from acute hospital and nursing home beds after respite.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357"> Recently, I spent a couple of hours in the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital, in my own constituency. For the front-line staff there, the solution to their problem is 90 to 100 beds. Any Minister for Health who comes in here and says he can reform the health service without dealing with the reality is in error. Beaumont Hospital needs 90 to 100 beds, which would make a huge dent in many of the problems we see. We have to look at ourselves and face the reality. We must ask if it is acceptable in 2015 to have a 102 year old woman lying on a trolley in any hospital. For me, that is not acceptable and is criminal. We need to focus on the issues and on people's lives. We need to restore the grants to 2011 levels to allow older people to adapt their homes when they need change. We also need to restore the benefits to 2011 levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358"> Approximately 35.4% of people in long-stay beds have low to medium support needs. Low dependency beds have seen a 44.6% increase from 2004. Medium dependency beds have increased 17.6% from 2004. Figures of low to medium dependency people in long-stay beds are increasing, while those for high to maximum are decreasing. There has been a 44.6% increase in the number of people with low support needs in nursing home beds from 2004 to 2013. There has been a 17.6% increase in the number of people with medium support needs in nursing home beds up to 2013. Research has shown there is a significantly higher number of older people going into nursing home care in Ireland than any of the other European countries. Approximately 7% of people aged 65 and over in Ireland live in nursing homes, whereas the figure is 4% for the same age group in the North. Those are the figures and statistics. To deal with the solutions, we have to deal with the facts. Ireland has 35% more people in nursing homes than the EU average as of 2013. The average length of stay in an Irish nursing home is 3.7 years while the average length of stay in UK nursing homes is 2.1 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359"> We need to deal with the lack of community care. The lack of finance for home help hours and home care packages, mobility aid cuts and the lack of supportive housing have led to older people being forced away from their homes and communities. From 2011 to 2015, 1.6 million hours were taken away from the home help allocations. There is no legal obligation on the Government to provide home care services. Home care services throughout Ireland are unregulated and unevenly distributed. The housing adaptation grant, which would allow homes to be modified, should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360"> These are the proposals we have put on the table. We also need to ensure the living alone allowance continues to reflect the cost of living and that the carer's allowance and half-rate carer's allowance are maintained. We need to recognise the value of respite supports and acknowledge the importance of the household adaptation grant for people with a disability, the housing aid for older persons scheme and home installation and energy saving for older people living at home. These will enhance the services for senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361"> I commend my colleague, Deputy Tom Fleming, on bringing this motion before the House. I thank and commend the Independent Deputies who have worked very hard on these issues and who also work very hard in their own constituencies every day. I want to build a country and society that has respect for our senior citizens. Many of these people have worked hard for many years and paid their taxes. It is the least they deserve now. I urge all Deputies to support our motion when it comes up for a vote tomorrow.</p>

          <p eId="para_1362">I call the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, who is sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_330">
          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1363">I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to contribute to the motion and to highlight the Government's steadfast commitment to our older citizens. When I became Minister for Social Protection, even though the public finances were practically bust, I was determined to ensure we protected older people given their massive contribution to the State. They helped sustain this country through bad times and bring the country to better times. Now, as Tánaiste, my goal is to ensure our older citizens share in the recovery that is under way, a process which began in the previous budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364"> Over the past ten years, there have been significant improvements with regard to the level of pensioner poverty in Ireland which, I am happy to say, has been steadily reduced. In 2004, the at risk of poverty rate for people aged 65 and older was very high, at 27.1%. According to the CSO survey on income and living conditions, SILC, data, by 2013 this rate had dropped below 10%. The consistent poverty rate for those age 65 in 2004 was 3.3%. By 2013, this had fallen to 1.9%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">It is a tribute to everybody involved in politics in this country that, notwithstanding our terrible economic experience, we have prioritised the protection of older people. Their relative position has improved compared with the boom days of 2004. The figures demonstrate that progress has been made in protecting older people against poverty, something which has been, and will remain, a key priority for the Government. Central to safeguarding older people against poverty is the State pension. It is a very valuable benefit and the bedrock of the pension system. A little known fact about our welfare system is that State pensions, including the contributory and non-contributory pensions, account for the single, largest block of social welfare expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366"> As we heard from previous speakers, while expenditure on pensions is increasing because of the growth in population and demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget. Last year, in 2014, overall expenditure by the Department was €19.8 billion but expenditure on the pensions programme accounted for almost one third of this figure at more than €6.6 billion. In 2015, expenditure on the pensions programme is estimated to reach €6.7 billion, or 34% of total expenditure by the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367"> I thank Deputies for the reference to last year's budget, in which I increased the living alone allowance, a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and which was last increased in 1996. I made the decision in recognition of the fact that people living alone can be more vulnerable to economic deprivation than a two person household where resources can be pooled. We are all familiar with houses where at one point there were five people, and at a certain stage even five adults, and now one individual remains and he or she must still carry the costs of the household.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368"> A second factor was that a very wide range of pensioner representative groups, whom I meet regularly, had identified such an increase as a key budget priority for a number of years. I will get technical for a moment. The real value of the State pension can be seen when viewing the market cost of an inflation-linked annuity of €12,000 a year, which is the current annual value of a State contributory pension. If one were to buy that on the market, the cost would be in excess of €300,000. The value does not include associated benefits available with the State pension such as increases for a spouse or another adult living with the person who qualifies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369"> Core pension rates have not been reduced in the period since 2009, despite the significant pressures of which people are aware following the crash. In dealing with the inherited economic crisis, it was a Government priority to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates such as the State pension. This was because maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty and gives people assurance and certainty about what they have to spend. When one is aged 70 or more, one does not have the option of earning extra income, as younger people might have. CSO figures show that people over the age of 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370"> Protecting the State pension has not been as easy as it sounds because when the Government came into office in 2011, the Social Insurance Fund deficit for 2010 was an enormous €2.8 billion. To put it more plainly, there was a huge hole of €2.8 billion in the fund. By building a jobs-led recovery, the Government has ensured that the Social Insurance Fund has been topped up by PRSI contributions from people going back to work and, therefore, we have been able to maintain the contributory principle. As a result, income from PRSI receipts this year is targeted to be just over €8.24 billion, with expenditure at almost €8.42 billion. The €2.8 billion hole in the Social Insurance Fund that put social protection at terrible risk has reduced to less than €200 million. In fact, we will shortly eliminate it altogether if we can continue the recovery. That is something about which we can be very pleased. It is a fifteenfold improvement on the funding position I inherited. The figures indicate a very healthy improvement in the income and expenditure position of the Social Insurance Fund. That allows me, as Minister for Social Protection, to ensure that the funding position for State pensioners is more than adequately protected. Pensioners do not have to worry that their pensions are at risk because as a country we have recovered to the point where people are going back to work and the income from PRSI, to which we all contribute, is available, in particular for contributory pensioners. That is a very important social insurance that protects everybody in society, but especially people of pension age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371"> Our country's population and demography is slowly but surely changing, with an increasing number of people entitled to a State pension. As a result, every year since I became Minister I have had to put aside approximately €200 million per year for the additional pensions required. That means that even if nothing else changes in the next five years, social welfare spending must increase by €1 billion to pay for all the contributory and non-contributory pensions required. We are able to do that as a society by careful management of our economic situation. It is so distressing for people in this country to see unfortunate people in Greece going to ATMs without being sure they can take out their money even after they have waited for hours to access their pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372"> Members also referred to the household benefits package. It is a very valuable support for older people and includes electricity and gas allowances worth €35 per month. The free television licence is worth €160 per year. The Department will spend €227 million this year on the package for approximately 415,000 customers. The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare-type payment. Importantly, the package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare-type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the package, retain the entitlement. The annual value of the package to each social welfare recipient is currently €580. I mentioned that free television licences form part of the package. That is important as television is an essential social good whereby people who might otherwise be a bit isolated can use it for entertainment, politics, sport or to keep them informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373"> The Christmas bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009. I remember the gasps of horror that went right through the Dáil on the day that was announced because people were shocked. The bonus was something everybody in the country valued for those who were retired or on pensions. I am pleased to say that because of the fledgling recovery I was able to partially restore it last year. A bonus of 25% was paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients, including all pensioners, carers and people with a disability, at a cost of more than €65 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">This benefitted over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375"> People mentioned free travel. I am happy to say that when I sat down with the Taoiseach, after I became leader of the Labour Party and was taking on the job of Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and I agreed, in the statement of priorities, that the Government commits itself to the full retention of the free travel scheme. It is available here and in the North and more than 828,000 people are in receipt of it. Including the companions and spouses, 1.3 million avail of free travel, and it costs the State €77 million, which is money well spent. When groups of pensioners take the train to Killarney for a nice day or a midweek break it is good for tourism and Killarney, and it is great for retired people to be able to do it in some comfort.</p>

          <p eId="para_1376">They are very welcome.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_332" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1377">Deputy Tom Fleming is always there to welcome them. Just 50% of people in employment have an occupational or supplementary pension, and only 41% in the private sector, despite all the efforts over the years to promote the importance of retirement savings to make life more comfortable in retirement. Given that the voluntary approach has not worked, in the statement of priorities after I became Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and I confirmed that the Government will agree a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new, universal supplementary pension savings scheme. We have established a high-level, universal retirement savings group, chaired by my Department, which includes international expertise. Countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the UK have introduced supplementary pension saving schemes. We are doing the work to set out how the scheme would work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378"> Deputies mentioned carers of older people, children and adults with an illness or disability. Carers do an unbelievable amount of work and help people live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, which is what everybody wants for themselves and for as many people as possible. Carers are vital to the achievement of this objective. Every day, parents, partners, children, friends and neighbours provide care for people who, through a variety of circumstances, need it. Their work makes a profound difference to the health, well-being and quality of life of the people for whom they care. It also makes an important, often unacknowledged contribution to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379"> We published the national carers’ strategy in 2012 and, in acknowledging the contribution that carers make, the Government provides a range of income supports including carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance for children who need care and the respite care grant. This year, it will cost us more than €822 million in social welfare payments. In 2004, only 23,000 people were in receipt of the carer's allowance. By last May, it had grown to 57,200 people. There has been a major increase in the number of people in receipt of the carer’s allowance or the half rate carer’s allowance. Nearly 25,000 of the people in receipt of carer’s allowance are at a half rate because they are in receipt of another social welfare payment. For example, a lone parent who is caring for one child on a full-time basis would receive €219.80 in one parent family payment and an extra €102 per week in a half rate carer’s allowance payment if he or she were caring for somebody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380"> Recipients of carer's allowance also qualify for free travel and, if they are living with the person they are caring for, the household benefits package. The respite care grant is an annual non-means-tested payment made to carers by the Department. Full-time carers who are not in receipt of a carer’s payment from the Department are also entitled to the respite care grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381"> Approximately 24,000 people over the age of 60 are in receipt of the invalidity pension. These are people who typically worked all their lives but are now unable to do so due to a long-term illness or disability, and who have been medically certified as being permanently incapable of taking up employment again. The invalidity pension is an important safety net, acting as a support if people find themselves in the unfortunate position of not being able to continue in employment for health reasons, up to the age State pension is payable. In addition to the pension, recipients of invalidity pensions are also entitled to free travel and may qualify for gas, electricity and fuel allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382"> Staff in my Department and the Intreo offices are ready to help, as are the information services we fund through the Citizens Information Board. The staff of my Department are committed to providing the best quality service we can to older people. We fund all the community employment schemes and community services programmes around the country. The Deputies here from the north inner city of Dublin and from Kerry know that every area of the State has community centres with community employment schemes funded by the Department which provide day services. People might meet friends, play a few games of 25 or such like and have lunch or other meals. This cuts across the social isolation whereby people, particularly in rural areas, but also in cities, can lose contact with their network of friends as they become older.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383"> I am very happy to support the motion and take it as a mark of the common concern everybody in Irish politics has to ensure that as far as possible we try to make life better all the time for older people, and that as we build an economic recovery, they share very importantly in a social recovery and in security, so that they have a solid future to which they can look forward, particularly living independently for as long as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1384">I welcome the motion. It is timely and well constructed. The contributions from both sides of the House serve us well as a Department when we deal with the issues around older people. As the Tánaiste outlined, there have been major challenges in recent years and it is a good time to take stock as to where we are and where we intend to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385"> One of my responsibilities relates to the 2016 commemorations and as part of the consultation process we have organised a number of meetings around the country to get feedback from people. The number of people of an older generation who were still fascinated and determined to make their contribution and still have the ethic of citizenship that may have diminished or been lost somewhat over the years was remarkable. When one engages with people of a certain generation who understand the citizenship ethic, who understand what it means to be a citizen of a country and who want to play their part in commemorating what has happened in the country over the past 100 years, and when they tell stories of their families, communities and where they come from, it is inspiring. It is only when we listen to them and learn from them that we can hope to build something brighter for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">I want to ensure people play their full role and feel part of next year's commemorations. We are in a period of reflection on Irish history, not least because we are coming out of a particularly difficult and painful economic turbulent time. We are also in a period of reflection of the past 100 years and building for the next 100 years. We have to discuss our values, the ones about which we feel strongly and, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan rightly said, about making this a country for old people. That is one of the aspirations to which we have to cling rigidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387"> Our population is aging rapidly with advances in health care leading to a dramatic rise in our older population. This is a positive development. It should never be construed otherwise or suggested these are resources that could be spent elsewhere. Each year, the total number of persons over the age of 65 is growing by around 20,000. Projections indicate this will continue to increase with the impact being more significant in the over 85 age group. We should celebrate this as the success story that it is. The Government is strongly committed to protecting and advancing the policies and services necessary to promote all aspects of growing older.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388"> Maintaining good health is the key to living well for longer. Older people are now staying healthy for longer than was previously the case. It is important society supports us all as we age, as well as providing access to high quality health and care services along with supports from primary care through to acute care, community, residential and end-of-life care. The Government’s policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This is where people have consistently said they want to be supported. We must consider how we can best respond to this clear preference. There is now a stronger emphasis on home care and other community services which provide a greater range of options to avoid admission to acute hospitals, support early discharges and, where appropriate, to rehabilitate and re-enable patients after periods of particular difficulty. The Health Service Executive provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity and as close to home as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389"> In its national service plan, NSP, for 2015 the HSE stated it will continue to progress the strategic realignment of services to provide home care and community support services to maximise the potential of older people in their own homes and communities. The levels of home supports planned for in the NSP are 10.3 million hours of home help service supporting 50,000 people. This is the same level of service as 2014. Up to 13,800 people will be in receipt of a home care package at any one time. This includes an additional 600 people supported under the delayed discharges initiative. Up to 190 people will be in receipt of an intensive home care package at any one time. These packages were introduced for the first time in 2014 for people with more complex care needs. An additional €2 million has been allocated in 2015 to expand the coverage of community intervention teams with a particular focus on hospital avoidance and earlier discharge from acute hospitals in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390"> In line with programme for Government commitments, our priority has been to modernise mental health services and to resource implementation of the widely agreed policy, A Vision for Change. Since 2012, the Government has provided additional ring-fenced funding of €125 million, resulting in around 1,150 posts of the type required to re-balance services towards greater community-based provision. The funding includes, among other measures, provision of enhanced specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391"> It reflects well on this Parliament when we can come together to agree a value statement for what we collectively believe in and try to deliver. This Chamber can often be a place of theatre, grandstanding and political point scoring. However, sometimes we do not give enough credit to ourselves for the level of collective understanding we have of what our people need. Older people living longer is to be celebrated. In this time of national reflection as we challenge ourselves to think of the values that underpin this Republic, this House has always striven to protect our older citizens, particularly those who may not have a family network to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392"> The State has done well in this regard in its history. Over the past eight years we have done the best we could despite budgetary constraints. We are in a position to improve now. The test for our value system will be how much we invest in this area. We can never suggest that someone’s dignity, wisdom and experience are too expensive to invest in. Many of the contributions tonight were very worthy of this House. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2015-07-14T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1393">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I salute the Technical Group for bringing forward this timely motion. It is only right and proper that we have this debate. We have had similar debates over the past several years because, unfortunately despite the Minister’s rhetoric, the elderly have not been protected in this Government’s lifetime. Pope Francis, a man whom I admire and who has won great admiration across the world for his directness, humility and how he has always spoken out for the marginalised in society, said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1394">We live in a time when the elderly do not count. It's awful to say, but they are discarded. Because they are a nuisance to us. The elderly are those who carry history, that carry doctrine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">He concluded that we must also remember those elderly who live in retirement homes, especially those abandoned by their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396"> How right he is. I have huge admiration for our senior citizens. They played a pivotal role in building our State to what it is today. They worked long and hard and paid their taxes. One need only think back to the hardships they endured. When one talks to one’s grandparents, even parents in some cases, one hears of how they went to school barefoot and brought turf to ensure the school was adequately heated. There were those who worked on building sites without the support of the machinery we have today. Now, when they come to live out their twilight years, they wish to do so in a degree of comfort, security and decency which they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397"> The manner in which this Government has targeted our senior citizens over the past several years has been nothing short of disgraceful. It flies in the face of its commitment in the programme for Government and the national positive aging strategy which aims to “enable people to age with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.”</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">Unfortunately, senior citizens' confidence has been eroded and their security, snatched. They have been robbed of their dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399"> It does not do the Government any good to state it has maintained the level of the statutory old age pension. That is true; there is no disputing it and it is a factual statement, but senior citizens are enraged when they hear it. What the Government fails to state is that, despite a promise made in the run-up to the general election and subsequently by the then Opposition spokesperson for health, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, that he would abolish prescription charges, not alone did he not abolish them but he also increased them fivefold, with a maximum figure of €25 a month for a single person or €50 a month for a couple. Eligibility for items under the medical card were removed. There was also a reduction in the income threshold under the over-70s medical card. The telephone allowance was abolished, even though it not only provided security for the elderly and kept them in contact with their families but also was a lifeline in terms of the emergency pendant worn around the neck. There was a reduction in the number of weeks for which the fuel allowance was paid. There was also a reduction in the number of the ESB units availed of by senior citizens. There was the introduction of the property tax and water charges. From where does the Minister of State think all of these charges were met? They were met from the old age pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400"> Seven out of ten senior citizens live exclusively on the State pension. The contributory old age pension is €230.30 a week, while thenon-contributory pension is €219. A senior citizen in my constituency is paying €36 a week in rent on her local authority house, full prescription charges for her medication, has to have a telephone in order to have the pendant around her neck, has to heat her house and eat. She is left with nothing at the end of the week. Recently I visited her on 80th birthday and asked if she was doing anything to mark it. She replied that, apart from some of her children bringing her out, she could not afford to do anything. Is that letting someone live with decency?</p>
          <p eId="para_1401"> I have stated 70% of pensioners live exclusively on the State pension. As for the other 30%, most live on a small private pension. Even at that, the Government did not leave it alone. It chose to rob them and reduce their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402"> It has often been said that in good times money is wasted. In the period 2001 to 2009 in actual terms the old age pension was increased by 65%. If one takes into account the rate of inflation, at 25%, there was a net increase of 40%. It was the right thing to do. It was right to give senior citizens something back because they had given so much to the foundation and development of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403"> When one looks at the recent media coverage of the wage increase granted to retired and retiring politicians and notes that the Government has chosen to give an increase to persons on salaries or pensions a multiple of what senior citizens have to live on, it shows what its priorities are in increasing the economic well-being of the population. There is the ludicrous situation where the Taoiseach has said the Government would like the people concerned to give it back. Why was it given in the first instance? It sends all the wrong signals and is morally wrong at a time when so many are living on a basic income of €230 a week or less than €12,000 a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404"> It was stated in the programme for Government in 2011, "Investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority of this Government." Despite the fact that we have an ageing population, why was there a reduction of over 1 million in the number of home help hours, from 11.7 million in 2010 to 10.3 million in 2014? In my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, there was a reduction of 60% between 2012 and 2013. I do not have the figure for 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405"> There is talk about the provision of housing grants that were introduced to ensure houses could be adapted for those with a disability to enable them to stay in their own homes, to ensure housing for the elderly could be insulated and that they could have their windows and doors replaced to ensure they would be comfortable. What did the Government do? It changed the eligibility criteria. The limit was increased from 60 to 66 years, while the amount paid out was slashed. In 2010, at the height of the recession, €1.6 million was spent on grants for the elderly in County Westmeath. In 2013 a figure of €561,000 was spent. I know an elderly couple in their 80s who cannot obtain a housing adaptation grant. For the first time since I became involved in public life in 2004, there is a waiting list to have necessary housing adaptations carried out. I know a constituent who recently received a grant - for some reason or other, this year's grants were announced late - and although the rain was leaking through her back kitchen, she could only receive 50% of what she needed to repair the roof. She cannot afford to pay the other 50% and has asked what is she to do. We are trying to get value for her from different builders to see if they can do the work at a reduced rate. That should not be happening, given that the Government is talking about people having a sense of decency and respect and about ensuring they can live independently in their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406"> I have received a telephone call this evening from a lady who is looking after her sister who is blind. She is in receipt of carer's allowance, while her sister is receiving blind person's allowance. She received her bill for water charges today and has left a message on my telephone tonight that she simply cannot afford to pay them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407"> There was an 83 year old lady in my clinic the other day whose daughter had applied for carer's allowance, but lo and behold, it had been refused. That is a symptom of what is happening time and again. Frankly, it is a delaying tactic on the part of the Department of Social Protection which is seeking to put every obstacle in people's way. It refuses people on the first occasion in the hope they may go away and not come back a second time. That is not good enough. It is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">The Minister for Social Protection should instruct her officials to ensure that when a comprehensive application is submitted it is dealt with in a timely manner and obstacles are not put in the way of people who are saving the State money. Those in receipt of a carers allowance are the only people actually working for their social welfare payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409"> I will talk about the unbelievable manner in which we are treating our elderly when it comes to hospital waiting lists. I could have spent my 15 minutes giving examples of people who are waiting in excess of two years for procedures such as hip replacements, knee replacements or the removal of cataracts. I know a man aged 80 who lives in rural Ireland and whose only means of independence is his car. He was told he cannot drive until his cataracts are removed and that he could be waiting two years for the operation. This Government is making him a prisoner in his own home. If the Minister wants to talk about ensuring decency and respecting the people who were the founders of our State, who helped to build our State and worked so hard, he should live up to the commitments in the programme for Government. Let us prioritise the most vulnerable and most marginalised, who do not seem to have a voice at the Cabinet table where so many disastrous decisions on cuts have been made in the past four and a half years. The Government should show its commitment to our senior citizens and restore many of the schemes it has cut in the past number of years. It should live up to its commitments to ensure our senior citizens can live in the independence of their own home, in security and decency. As the Minister said, how we treat our senior citizens says a lot about who we are as a society.</p>

          <p eId="para_1413">I take it the Government will not oppose this motion and I am delighted to hear that. There can be no denying that we are an ageing population. When I look into a mirror I see it, as I normally do when I look around this Chamber. I do not see it so much tonight but it is evident on other occasions, and certainly during votes. One sees a lot of grey hairs here and this institution reflects what is happening in the country as a whole. By 2026 there will be approximately 908,000 people aged 65 years and older, accounting for 16% of the population. I do not count those over 65 as old but that is the statistic. By 2045 there will be three working people to every one older person, which will be down from the ratio of six to one that currently exists. This is a sobering thought and a fundamental change which, unless it is planned for, will cause chaos and harm, particularly for our senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414"> Older people could be forgiven for thinking this Government does not have a good record when it comes to making decisions that affect their future. We have witnessed cuts to the housing benefits package, living alone allowance, carer's allowance and home help service cuts. We have seen a reduction or the withdrawal of financial supports for house conversions to enable senior citizens to stay in their own homes. Every rural transport cut, every post office closed, every health service delay impacts directly and most severely on our senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415"> Cuts to fuel allowance are a particular cut that can have a major impact on the lives of the elderly. Fuel poverty is in my brief and is in many respects a matter of distributive injustice as it is the poorest in society who are often those who suffer greatest from the lack of adequate heat. Not only does a lack of adequate heating make conditions more uncomfortable for those households, it can have a direct impact on their physical and mental health. Sinn Féin believes the fuel allowance should be extended by three weeks per annum as a small help in eliminating fuel poverty. </p>
          <p eId="para_1416"> Local authority and housing association tenants frequently tell me that storage heating in their homes is very expensive, particularly in rural areas. Local authority and housing association tenants would much prefer solid fuel cookers because there is a ready availability of supply, even when funding is low. Energy affordability is a factor for senior citizens, as are convenience and safety but if we are to continue to use storage heating in local authority and housing association homes we need to get the costs down dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417"> If we wish to see an Ireland where our senior citizens can continue living independent, dignified lives we must as a nation, rethink how we design and implement services. We must ensure the organisational bunker thinking of Government, State, semi-State and local government departments changes because there is an attitude which says, "Protect my budget at all costs and forget about the person in respect of whom the decision has been made." Organisational lines are high walls.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418"> We must provide greater support to families who are prepared to care for disabled or elderly people at home. Too often, those who selflessly care for aged relatives feel as if the State views them as unworthy of seeking help. They are made to feel bad for seeking help to do the right thing by ageing relatives. We must also look at minimising dependence on community nursing units by providing independent living apartments supported by central catering and care units for people who would not be capable of independent living at home. An excellent example is Áras Bhríde in Drumkeerin in my constituency. People love it there and are safe. They are not quite independent enough to live at home but they can live in their own community. It is an excellent model. It is not under the HSE nor a council but is a service which maintains the independence of those who avail of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419"> I commend the Deputies who tabled this most important motion and thank them for doing so.</p>
