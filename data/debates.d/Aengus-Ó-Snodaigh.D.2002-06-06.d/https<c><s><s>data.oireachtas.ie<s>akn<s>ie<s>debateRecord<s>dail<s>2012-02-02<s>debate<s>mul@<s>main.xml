          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The intergovernmental treaty finalised last Monday included a statement from the European Council on growth, consolidation and job creation.  It concluded much more needed to be done to deal with the crisis, particularly the jobs crisis.  The Europe 2020 strategy was mentioned and each member state is to set out its national jobs plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">We have yet to see a national jobs plan here even though the Government has announced, according to ISME, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, its pending publication nine times.  This must be set against the promise at the time of the general election of 100,000 jobs coming from NewERA and also the famous jobs fund that was to be set up in a strategic investment bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">We know we have a major problem in this country with youth unemployment and youth migration.  Will the Government set up a national youth employment fund, similar to that in the UK and other EU countries?  When will the Government publish its plans on how to address unemployment?  Has it agreed to utilise the European Stability Fund, ESF, to support more apprenticeship programmes for young business start-ups?</p>

There was a specific agreement that the economic situation in Europe cannot be resolved alone by budgetary and fiscal measures but that there needs to be a jobs and growth strategy.  The Government was keen to have this on the agenda and for it to continue to be so.  In addition to the measures agreed last Monday on youth unemployment, small and medium-sized businesses and the completion of the Single Market, it was also agreed that the jobs and growth agenda would remain on the agendas for future European summits.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">With regard to the measures taken by the Government, as the Deputy knows, we intend to publish a jobs action plan.  The draft of it was considered by the Government this week and it is expected to be published in a matter of weeks.  Complementing that plan, there are also the labour activation measures for which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has responsibility.  She will publish shortly the pathways to work initiatives which will set out in detail the measures the Government will take to ensure training, education, job experience, internships and so on are provided for people who are out of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">In addition, the Government is also pursuing an investment strategy.  Next week, the Taoiseach and I will attend an investment meeting convened by the former US President, Bill Clinton, in New York.  When he attended the global Irish economic forum in October, he committed to convene an investment meeting mainly of people who would not normally have associations with Ireland.  That meeting is due to take place next week and will be attended by both the Taoiseach and myself.  Very soon there will be a visit by the vice president of China with whom we have been discussing the possibilities for expansion of trade and investment between the two countries, all of which is aimed at the generation of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The approach the Government will take to the issue of youth unemployment will be contained in the pathways to work initiative which will be launched soon by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  The jobs action plan that is being considered by the Government will be published shortly.  Funding for small and medium-sized enterprises was part of the agreement reached last Monday.  We will continue to ensure all of the European Union instruments available to extend funding for small and medium-sized enterprises are used to the full by this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">It is appropriate that the Tánaiste raised the issue of funding for small and medium-sized enterprises because financial stability is vital for business.  An issue has arisen in respect of Galway Airport that has wide implications for businesses across the country.  Last Thursday, Galway Airport had €1.6 million on deposit in a bank account.</p>

The bank transferred €1.1 million of that money without notice to offset against its term loans.  If that practice is carried across to other businesses, it will have a significant impact because a company which puts money into its bank account can no longer be certain that it will not be offset against term loans that are up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">This is one of the covered banks, into which we have put billions of euro to ensure businesses can trade.  What is the Government going to do to ensure that the issue is dealt with and that the covered institutions are told in no uncertain terms that the practice is not acceptable because businesses have to be able to function normally and the normal rules of business must apply?  I want a specific and clear answer regarding what the Government intends to do to ensure this will not be the first of many cases whereby the banks carry out this outrageous practice.</p>

We have spoken directly to the banks about how they are meeting those targets and we intend to do so again in the near future.  In respect of difficulties that arise with the operation of that initiative in practice, Deputy Ó Cuív will be aware that the Credit Review Office of the Department of Finance has responsibility for liaising with the banking system and individual banks and can deal with the kind of issues raised by Deputy Ó Cuív.  I expect that if the banks have changed their policies in this area, the matter can be pursued through the Credit Review Office.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">I raise the issue of exceptional needs payments, which I understand the Minister for Social Protection is proposing to cut as part of her continuing crusade against families on low incomes.  The exceptional needs payment is, by definition, made to families with exceptional needs.  Last year, almost 250,000 payments were made under this scheme.  Throughout the Government's programme of austerity and its budget cuts, the Minister, Deputy Burton, reassured people that they could always go to their community welfare officers if they found themselves in dire need.  Now, however, it seems the Government is intent on cutting even this safety net.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Does the Minister plan to take €8.5 million from some of the poorest families in the State and where does the Tánaiste suggest they go?  Does he suggest they should simply present to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul?  Is it now Government policy to slash basic entitlements for those on low incomes, remove safety nets, wash its hands of responsibility and rely on organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to pick up the pieces?</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_19">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_27">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make single payments to help meet once off and exceptional essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to cover out of his or her weekly income.  The Department spent approximately €63 million on these payments last year and made payments to 226,000 individual claimants.  Budget 2012 requires savings of €8.5 million in this area.  The exceptional needs payment has been in operation for some time and the guidelines covering its application have not been reviewed since 1995.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is changing the guidelines to reflect the current realities.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Among the changes she is making is the way in which exceptional needs payments are applied in different parts of the country.  Exceptional needs payments made in some parts of the country do not apply elsewhere.  One example which was highlighted in some of today's newspapers relates to payments made for communions and confirmations.  Last year, 14,000 payments were made for communions and confirmations, amounting to a total of €3.4 million.  The Minister's view, which I share, is that lavish expenditure has in some cases been associated with communions and confirmations.  I am aware that many parishes and schools are anxious to get the costs associated with these events somewhat under control.  As a result of that, she has decided to limit these payments to €110 in each case as part of the changes she is making to the guidelines.  I hope that will help to limit the amount of expenditure in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">The application of these payments varies in parts of the country.  In Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, for example, only 25 payments were made last year in respect of communions and confirmations.</p>

Increasingly, these payments are availed of not only by individuals and families on social welfare, but also the working poor and families who are finding it difficult to keep the ship afloat.  Regardless of the Tánaiste's views of communion, confirmation or any other religious milestone in a citizen's life, a child has to be dressed for the occasion.  He referenced those particular payments but the vast bulk of the exceptional payments relate to cookers, washing machines or energy bills that cannot be paid.  There is an astonishing contrast between the €6 million in expenses, some of which is unvouched, that Members of the Dáil claim-----</p>

The cut to the national minimum wage that was made by the previous Government was reversed by this Government, something Deputy McDonald said we would not do.  We are dealing with special needs payments, which are once-off payments made by community welfare officers.  The guidelines given to the community welfare officers governing those payments have not been changed since 1995.  Even Deputy McDonald will acknowledge that much has changed since 1995.  There are people who may be in need of special needs payments for one reason or another but cannot get them because the community welfare officers are operating on the basis of rules that are 17 years old.  There are other cases where payments are being made in some parts of the country which I agree might be more appropriate where there is a greater level of need.</p>

From time to time it is necessary to change the way in which those moneys are spent to ensure they go to those in the greatest need.

I hope the Tánaiste can do something about the matter.  All Members of this House support the valuable and compassionate work of this organisation and successive governments have supported Justice for the Forgotten, which is as it should be.  I ask the Tánaiste to continue this work with the victims and their families.  When I mention the Justice for the Forgotten group, I also refer to all the victims of the conflict and especially those who seek support.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Has the Government raised the issue of the Miami Showband massacre or the Dublin and Monaghan bombings at any recent meetings with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, or other members of the British Government?

The terms of that motion were conveyed to the British Parliament and British Government.  I have met representatives of Justice for the Forgotten.  On several occasions we have raised with the British Government the motion that was passed unanimously, one of the terms of which was a call for the release of all the documents that relate to the bombings.  As the Deputy knows, the British Government has not agreed to release some of those documents, but we have continued to press the case directly with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">The Taoiseach has raised the issue directly with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  I have raised it with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Patterson, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Mr. Hague, and the British Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Clegg.  It is something we continue to do on an ongoing basis.  In addition to the issues of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and the Miami Showband killings, we have also been pursuing the issue of the killing of the solicitor, Mr. Pat Finucane - I have been in touch with the Finucane family in that regard.  We have also discussed with the British Government the wider issue of the many atrocities that occurred and the grief that many families still feel.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to have that discussion with British Ministers with a view to arriving at a framework or a resolution that will give closure to the families concerned.</p>

Why does the Tánaiste believe the British Government does not want to release these documents particularly in light of developments such as the British Prime Minister apologising for Bloody Sunday and the positive reaction on the island of Ireland to that statement?  Many people are very concerned and have suspicions on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Is the Tánaiste aware that one of the reasons Justice for the Forgotten is €17,000 short is that Dublin, because of its location, is outside the geographical remit of the special EU programmes body and is therefore excluded?  The families have asked me to ask the Tánaiste to seek to resolve this technical problem as there should never be a hierarchy of victims on the basis of their locations.  When investigating the €17,000 for this group, the Tánaiste could also examine examples of waste of taxpayers' money including €145,000 being spent on storing e-voting machines and €500,000 the OPW is paying on renting empty offices.  I urge the Tánaiste to support Justice for the Forgotten and try to find the €17,000 to support its Dublin office.  As they have suffered enough injustice, let us do something to resolve this issue which is small financially but is big for the families.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">This is the first time the Deputy has raised the issue of the shortage of funding of €17,000 with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Without briefing myself on the entire issue and the financial situation I cannot give Deputy McGrath a commitment across the floor of the House on it other than to say that I will look at it.  As Deputy McGrath is aware my Department provides funding for reconciliation purposes and provides support for the victims of the conflict.  I hope to be able to continue that funding through this year.  There is a system whereby various groups and organisations make applications for such funding.  I will consider the issue Deputy McGrath has raised and the question of the money in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I am mindful of the grief, sorrow, loss and the continuing sense of grievance that the families of victims of the Northern Ireland years of trouble are experiencing.  This applies irrespective of whether those families are in Dublin, Belfast, Sion Mills or anywhere else.  There has been a considerable amount of grief and hurt and this issue is on the agenda in the discussions I have directly with Secretary of State Paterson and those held on a bilateral basis between the Irish and British Governments.  We are conscious that the issue must be dealt with sensitively and appropriately.  There are areas where we disagree about what needs to be done.  For example, one such area in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings has been the continuing refusal of the British Government to make available the material sought by the Dáil.</p>

        <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  We made a commitment to the people during the general election last year that this would be a reforming Government and that while restoring our country's fiscal sovereignty would be our prime objective, we would also take the opportunity to reform all aspects of society to better meet the needs and realities of Ireland in the 21st century.  Our aim would be to find a new vision for the country and to build a better country in pursuit of that vision.  No sector of our economy or society can claim it is incapable of performing better, including this Parliament.  We have only just begun our work, but already some important steps have been taken.  This Bill is another important step in the process of the reform we hope to bring about for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The Minister has asked for constructive proposals on how the Legal Services Regulation Bill may be strengthened and I hope to offer some in this debate.  I have spoken with and corresponded with the Minister on this matter previously and I appreciate the fact he took the time to engage with me in detail on the various issues.  We also had an excellent briefing last week on the Bill with the Minister and his officials where we had the opportunity to go through each section of the Bill in detail.  Again, I thank the Minister for his time and for answering my questions in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Today, I would like to speak about some particular aspects of the Bill because although we have discussed these issues previously, it is important that as a member of one of the Government parties I come into the House and contribute to the debate.  Much of the work of Government Deputy happens in the background, in parliamentary party meetings and in one-on-one meetings with Ministers and their officials.  However, it is important to the process that we also come into the House and express our opinions.  I feel that too much of the work of an elected representative to this House is confined to that of a constituency representative and that needs to change.  It is changing, but slowly.  We are elected both to represent our constituents and to attend Parliament and bring our judgment to bear on matters of national importance.  That does not mean coming in here and pushing a button once or twice a week, or standing up and speaking to a half-empty Chamber and calling it debate.  This is a criticism I level at all of us, myself included.  The country wants us to do better.  It wants reform in this Chamber and wants us to be better and we cannot let reform of this House slip off the agenda, even for a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">As for reform of the legal profession, an issue this Bill attempts to address, it is critical to the functioning of a true and proper democracy that operation and regulation of the legal profession and system is truly independent of the executive and legislative branches of government.  To blur that separation of powers even slightly is to strike at the delicate balance underpinning our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">In a democracy, an independent legal system is essential to protecting and vindicating the legal rights of citizens.  Anything that seeks to alter the constitution of that system, even with a view to improving it, must be examined very carefully.  Independence is not an absolute term or meaning.  It has different connotations.  It is varied in its practice and it is relative.  As a general principle, we can agree that it is preferable that no body or profession would regulate itself.  That is true for the legal profession as it is true for the other professions.  However, it is also important to recognise that in a democracy, given the special position of the legal profession, neither can the operation and regulation of that system be vested in the Government alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 establishes a legal services regulatory authority to regulate and control the legal profession, something we all would welcome in this House.  However, questions have been raised about its constitution and there is a concern about potential political interference from future administrations.  When we address new Bills in this House, we must remember that the ensuing legislation will remain after we are gone.  We must always keep in mind those who will follow us into this Chamber and those who may occupy the front benches.  Questions have been raised and we should not be afraid of them.  We should answer these questions and where they are ridiculous, let us say that they are ridiculous and where they merit consideration, let us consider them.  The Government will not have all the answers and we will not get it perfect every time.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">I am personally interested in those proposals which have been put forward to parliamentarians that would seek to constitute the regulatory authority in a slightly different manner to that which is proposed in the Bill.  I am particularly interested in those elements that seek to give more of a role to Members of the Oireachtas as a pillar separate to that of the Executive.  These give us more of a role as legislators and give more weight to what we do in our work in the Government.  That is important as part of the reform that we need to seek in this House.  We can achieve that without impinging on the independence principle that we are all seeking to promote as we go about reforming the legal profession and as is contained in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">It is important that the appointment of a new regulatory authority is transparent and is seen to be transparent, uninfluenced by day-to-day political concerns.  I wonder if there might be a role for the Commission for Public Service Appointments, or a similar body or committee, to nominate members for the Government to appoint to the regulatory authority.  I agree with the Minister that it is also important the authority has a lay majority.  However, it might be a good idea for those lay members to be nominated from particular sectors of our society, such as the non-governmental sector or other professional bodies, which will add to the variety of the authority and will increase its expertise.  I would also like to see the regulatory authority reporting to the Oireachtas and its committees.  If anything, this will strengthen the role of the Oireachtas and its independence from the Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">We could decide that Members of the Oireachtas will be responsible for dealing with those matters that may arise in the work of the regulatory authority, such as whether a member should be removed from the authority.  That may fall to the Oireachtas or one of its committees to decide, and then only for stated reasons.  I raise these two points because it is important in the context of the future Governments and future Members of Parliament who may sit here after us.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">We have also discussed the potential costs of the regulatory authority.  It is important that it is funded appropriately, so that it can carry out its work.  It will have a lot of work to do under this Bill and it is appropriate that it has the right number of staff and all the resources necessary so that it can effectively regulate the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The Minister is looking at the ways in which we might cost or provide for the funding of this authority but it is preferable that the authority would be established in such a way that it would not increase costs for the consumer.  That is an important principle and I look forward to any proposals that the Minister has on that issue.  He has also indicated that amendments may be made to the consent provisions in the Bill, and I look forward to considering them on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">I appreciate that there is a compelling reason for reviewing the current structures of the legal profession.  However, given how significant the changes will be - it is a big change to how legal services operate in this country and to how people access those services - it has been suggested that there may be room for further development of the part of the Bill dealing with multi-disciplinary practices in separate legislation.   This merits some consideration given the huge amount of work that will be involved in it, and I know the Minister is committed to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I am interested to hear more about how it is intended the new disciplinary tribunals are to interact with the new authority.  Will they come under it?  Will they share membership or other structures?  Will they be appointed by the authority or will they be strictly independent of it?  If they are independent, how will they be constituted and to whom will they report?  We have not had an opportunity to speak about that yet, and I would appreciate clarification on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I hope that those proposals may be constructive to the work the Minister is trying to do.  As a backbench Member of the senior party in the Government, it is important that contribute to this debate and be as constructive as I can.  There is a long way to go.  It is a large, ambitious Bill and I congratulate the Minister for that.  I look forward to participating in further debates as we move to Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_163">The Minister for Justice and Equality is to be commended for introducing the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which provides for the much anticipated and necessary changes to the manner in which legal services are provided and the legal profession is regulated in Ireland.  For many years there has been resistance to legal change in this country, much of it within the legal profession itself.  However, there is a realisation by now from all stakeholders that change is needed and can benefit both the legal profession and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The regulation of the entire legal profession - barristers and solicitors - is of fundamental importance to the proper administration of justice in Ireland.  Such regulation must be independent, transparent, accountable and above reproach.  The vast majority of barristers and solicitors are above reproach but it is vital that any deviation from the highest standards is dealt with in a fair, independent and transparent way.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Until now, rightly or wrongly, the view among the general public is that barristers and solicitors have not been regulated in any meaningful way.  They would say that very few barristers have been censored or suspended, although there has been some examples recently.  Solicitors live in the real world.  They are not immune from the current economic difficulties which exist for all who are living in Ireland.  The costs of legal practice have escalated in recent years, particularly in the area of professional indemnity insurance, which is compulsory for all solicitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The provision of legal services, like other professional services, must be regulated in the public interest.  There is existing regulation of legal professionals, but there have been many public examples of why the current system, whereby legal professionals are regulated and represented by the same body, is not effective and cannot be sustained.  The best examples of the failure of the current system to regulate its members are almost certainly not in the public domain, having been sheltered by an ineffective, untransparent and self-regulatory regime.  There is no doubt but that the interest of the public would be considerably better served by an independent and modern model of regulation.  I welcome the Law Society's recent change of position on how clients make complaints.  The society has acknowledged for the first time that the best interests of the public and the profession would be served when client complaints were made to an independent body and not to the society itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I have spoken many times of the challenges facing small and medium sized businesses in my constituency and beyond.  One such challenge is the professional costs, including legal fees, associated with establishing and running a business in the current regulatory environment.  The new legal costs regime proposed in the Bill, which will make it easier for businesses and members of the public to understand, account for and dispute legal costs arising, is to be welcomed.  As legislators, we too have a duty to improve the quality and clarity of legislation and regulation emanating from this House in order that members of the public can understand and address their legal obligations without recourse in every case to solicitors or barristers.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The regulation of solicitors under the Solicitors Acts as administered by the Law Society has become the subject of serious scrutiny by members of the public and the majority of solicitors.  We have the debacle of the Solicitors Mutual Defence Fund becoming insolvent to the tune of almost €170 million.  The company sought to trade out of its difficulties and continued to take money in premiums from unsuspecting solicitors for professional indemnity insurance cover.  The directors of the fund and Law Society should have known the company was insolvent.  Solicitors are now burdened with the added problem of rescuing the Solicitors Mutual Defence Fund and covering the cost of funding its run-down and insolvency, notwithstanding that the majority of practising solicitors acted prudently in dealing with their professional indemnity insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The regulation of solicitors has become bureaucratic and costly.  It is simply not good enough that members of the public with genuine grievances against solicitors can wait up to two years to secure a decision from the Law Society.  Solicitors can be the victims of unsubstantiated and unrealistic claims, particularly when the Law Society's investigating accountants incur substantial expense and difficulty in attempting to deal with a system that is not fit for purpose, as is the case at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">I welcome the Minister's willingness to meet, consult and seek submissions from all the stakeholders.  His confirmation that he is considering some relevant amendments for the Committee Stage debate, such as an amendment to remove the requirement to obtain the Minister's consent for any code of practice proposed by the regulatory authority and amendments to remove any doubt that may exist concerning the independence of the proposed legal services regulatory authority in the context of the appointment of members thereto, demonstrates his determination to get the legislation exactly right.  I commend him on introducing a long overdue Bill which will be enacted as part of the Government's reform of the country's institutions and structures.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_171">Is trua liom nach féidir liom fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo, in ainneoin go mbínn ag lorg, thar na blianta, go mbéadh Bille den sort seo curtha os comhair na Dála agus go mbéadh athraithe curtha i bhfeidhm ar an gcóras dlí agus ar an chaoi a dhéanann abhchóidí agus dlíodóirí a ngnó féin a reachtáil agus go mbéadh an gnó sin níos oscailte agus níos soiléire don phobal i gcoitinne.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Tá rudaí maithe ins an mBille seo, agus molaim an t-Aire as an chuid sin de a thabhairt chun cinn.  Ach is trua liom go bhfuil dáinséir laistigh den mBille a dhéanfaidh sé deacair don chóras uilig a bheith neamhspleách ar an Rialtas.  Má achtófar an Bille mar atá sé faoi láthair tá an dáinséar ann - agus níl mé ag rá go ndéanfadh an t-Aire é seo - go gcuirfeadh Aire a ladar isteach níos mó ná ba chóir i gcóras atá in ainm is a bheith neamhspleách.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I have concerns about the Bill before us.  I would love to be in a position to welcome legislation that set out to address fully the costs of the legal profession and the vested interests aspect of that profession.  Although the Bill attempts to do this, it also provides for a degree of ministerial control over the legal professions that is not healthy and does not have any place in legislation.  I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will address this concern, which has been raised by the legal professions and others, including those with an interest in human rights around the world.  The control exerted by the Minister through the proposed appointments mechanism is a retrograde step.  The Bill should reflect best practice.  I hope, therefore, that this power will be removed on Committee Stage and the other measures in the legislation result in our legal profession becoming the best and most transparent in the world in terms of costs and the way in which it regulates itself.  The legal profession should not be dictated to by a Minister and it would set a dangerous precedent to go down the route proposed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">As I indicated, the legislation has some welcome features, including provisions requiring transparency in the area of costs.  While we have the benefit of the Taxing Master, we still do not have a full understanding of how decisions are reached on costs because the system lacks openness.  The most welcome feature of the legislation is the proposal to establish a chief legal costs adjudicator to assume the role currently performed by the Taxing Master.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Legal costs are falling, which may be a consequence of the economic crisis or greater competition in the various grades of legal practitioners.  The number of solicitors and barristers practising law appears to have increased significantly in recent years and this may have created a degree of competition in the legal profession.  We need to be careful, therefore, to ensure that nothing in the Bill reverses the downward trend in legal costs or makes access to the law more expensive.  If an amended Bill is passed, I hope the mechanism of a chief legal costs adjudicator will ensure we obtain value for money from the legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The bodies representing solicitors and barristers have expressed concern about the fee the Minister has provided for in the Bill to cover the costs of establishing the new legal services regulatory authority.  The Bar Council and Law Society impose their own fees, some of which probably inhibit access to the legal profession for those seeking to enter it.  At what level will be the fee or levy demanded for the new authority be set?  Will it be higher than the fees currently paid by legal practitioners?  If so, will it drive away some of those in the legal profession who are not managing to roll in the money?  As we know, there is a perception that practising solicitors and barristers are rolling in money.  One need only attend the courts to see that quite a number of people in the legal profession are struggling to make ends meet and have invested a lot of money in their practices and the overheads which go with that.  Any additional costs for this profession, or for any profession, over and above what it is already paying must be questioned.  What is the overall estimate, because I presume the Minister and his adviser have come up with an estimate of the levy which will be imposed on practitioners?  Will it be more than the annual fees he or she currently pay to his or her respective associations?</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Three new offices will be set up and, in some ways, it might be a good thing for all three to be separate.  The legal services regulatory authority, the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal and the office of the legal costs adjudicator are welcome but the Minister has much more power in terms of appointments and nominations.  If one looks at the equivalent situation in other professions, it seems odd the Minister has decided to go down this route.  For many years, we, in this House, have argued that rather than the Minister being the nominating person, at the very least, a committee of the House should appoint people to the likes of the three new offices which will be established.  Even if a committee was to deal with it, it would still be reflective of Government.  However, if there was an external nominating body and a committee of this House appointed people from a panel, it would be a more independent process than what is suggested in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">It is not my area of expertise but I have concerns about the business structure suggested in the Bill, and not from any belief that solicitors and barristers should not work together or with other professions in a multi-disciplinary setting.  In my family, there is quite a number of rural solicitors in Limerick.  They set up a business and served the town of Newcastle West well for many years, as have other solicitors in that town.  If we create large law firms with barristers, solicitors and other experts, is there a danger we might force business away from the small towns into the larger ones where all the expertise is in a one-stop-shop?  It is a concern I have, although I have not fully worked it out.  I will try to elaborate further on it on Committee Stage.  I have been lobbied by a number of small practices which are concerned that in the event of this happening, they will be forced to close or to amalgamate, which was not their intention in the first instance.  They wanted to be sole traders and independent solicitors operating in, and serving, a community.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The overheads of large firms will be less which means they will be able to drive down the fees they will charge the public which will make it more attractive for the public to go to them, especially in the current climate.  In the future, it might only be loyalty which will keep people with some of the smaller rural practices, although there is a number of small practices in cities and small towns and villages.  If the market starts to be dominated by these multi-disciplinary teams, it would be a bad day for the legal services in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I hope the Minister will address some of the concerns raised by Deputies on Committee Stage which is the advantage of that Stage.  If the heads of this Bill had been published much earlier than the Bill itself and if the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had hearings on the heads, we might have been able to have a more acceptable Bill at this Stage rather than have to do much of the work on Committee Stage.  Given that this is such a substantial change to the regulation of our legal services, it is vital we get it right.  It is not something to which we can keep coming back.  We have one chance to get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">This involves listening to the practitioners, whether barristers or solicitors, and to the users, those who have complaints.  There have been quite a number of complaints over the years about solicitors and barristers.  Anybody who deals with the public on a regular basis in clinics and so on will know that quite a substantial number of complaints involve solicitors who did not represent people properly, did not take their advice or gave no reason for a charge.  These are all valid points which are being addressed in this Bill but if there had been a hearing at committee, the public would have had a greater understanding of where this Bill is going.  If it needed to be tweaked, it could have been done at an earlier stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Not only that, but we could have invited in international experts to give their tuppence worth to see whether this is in line with best practice elsewhere and to see where the UN and other bodies such as that want legal services in a country to go.  The more independent legal practitioners and the legal system are of government, the better.  That is a major concern I have that this Bill seems to undermine some of the independence which has been there.  Perhaps that independence was abused by having a closed shop and vested interests but that does not mean the services need to be under the full control of a Minister.  There is a half way house which is that we set up the regulatory bodies and have an outside body appoint the lay members or other board members rather than it being dominated by ministerial appointees, as is proposed.</p>

        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_183">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the reform of legal services.  This is important legislation and I share the concerns Deputy Ó Snodaigh expressed in regard to how the Bill was brought forward.  I will come back to its contents in a moment but it is unfortunate - it is certainly not the Government's or the Minister's fault - that the Bill came before us rather quickly last October but there is a provision in the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding requiring reforms to be brought forward and the Bill had to be published by a particular date.  That was probably the reason there was not the kind of advanced discussion, consultation and debate which Deputy Ó Snodaigh rightly said would be appropriate in the case of such fundamental reform as is contemplated, or proposed to be introduced, in this legislation.  The necessity for reform and modernisation right across the board is well understood and the point is well taken.  However, when one sets out to reform the provision of legal services there are many questions that enter into the equation and there are many issues on the agenda.  The competition agenda is often canvassed as an important one, and I would not for a moment say that it is not relevant or important.  The term "the public interest" is often bandied about and people sometimes have different interpretations of it.  Very often people put a political spin on it - what they regard as being in the public interest politically.  Nonetheless, we have a broad understanding of what we mean as politicians and legislators about what is right and appropriate in terms of providing, for example, legal services in the public interest.  Reform and modernisation are therefore essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">There must be proper debate and consultation, and not just with the professions.  The professions are well represented and have opportunities to bring their views into the public arena and it is correct that they should do so.  Consumers of legal services are citizens who depend on the legal profession and the courts to vindicate and defend their rights in disputes, and sometimes in highly controversial circumstances.  In debating this legislation, we are principally directing our attention to the citizens.  I know that is the perspective of the Minister and the Government also.  We need to listen carefully to what the professions have to say but we must legislate in the public interest, which requires a broad view to be taken, rather than one in favour of a profession or vested interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">I have believed for years that there was a need to reform legal services.  I have worked in the legal profession for almost 20 years and have had a reasonable opportunity to view how it works, or does not.  As a practising lawyer and a member of the Bar, I have been disappointed by the slowness of reform and an unwillingness on the part of the professions to embrace or promote change.  This has led to a situation whereby people feel they are victims of change instead of taking the opportunity, when it is there, to advance proposals for change to the way things are done in their own professions.  The Minister himself has been a practitioner.  Practitioners are there on a daily basis and can understand the requirements and drawbacks, as well as seeing where the gaps are.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The profession I know best is the Bar because that is the area in which I have been involved.  There has been a failure and a lamentable lethargy concerning the need for reform.  We need to address the question of equity within the legal professions, and in particular the distribution of work at the Bar.  So much work - I am not saying all - finds its way to a relatively small number of practitioners.  They are excellent practitioners - there is no question about that - but the Bar itself has been slow in bringing forward proposals to better facilitate younger barristers coming into the profession, people who are willing and well able to work.  That has not been done but it is an area that should have been addressed and still requires to be addressed.  People have been slow to embrace that.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The tone of the debate in recent months has been unfortunate as there has been overstatement on the part of the professions as to the implications of some of the Bill's proposals.  With respect, there has also been overreaction to that overstatement.  A change of tone in the debate is required in the coming weeks and months when decisions will have to be made regarding the final content of the legislation.  I can understand why the reaction may be rhetorical when barristers or solicitors make a certain point because they are trying to protect their vested interests.  Many things are said, including that they are trying to stay in the 19th century and are a cabal.  It is possible that when the profession's representatives come forward with ideas, even critical ones, they are doing so for reasons other than to protect their self interest.  We must be careful about that and alive to the possibility that people are simply being defensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">On the other side of the equation, we must not throw the baby out with the bath water by stating that because people might be motivated by self interest, we must completely reject what they say.  I am not suggesting that is what the Minister proposes to do, but we need to lower the temperature of this tense debate.  We should all sit down to look at these issues and come to the best possible outcome not for any one interest group, but for the citizens we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The independence of the legal profession has been the most debated question in this regard.  I do not need to dwell on it, however, because everybody agrees that it is important.  Everybody accepts - how could they not - that the independence of the legal profession is vital in any democracy.  It is actually a test of the strength of a democracy.  Examples are sometimes given of the impecunious litigant who appears in court to challenge the State on a difficult area of law.  The litigant requires to be represented by an absolutely fearless advocate, somebody who is never concerned by any attempt to trample on his or her independence.  Such an advocate should be absolutely fearless before any court and should not have any concern about repercussions, either from the Government or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">As well as being a test of democracy, it is also a big part of the rule of law.  We talk a lot about the economic concerns and how the economy, and this country, are viewed abroad.  This issue is also related to economic rights and the view of Ireland abroad.  Prospective foreign investors need to understand and appreciate that we have a fully independent legal profession that is beholden to no one, be it the Government or others.  It is therefore absolutely vital that this independence should be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">It is not a formalistic matter.  I have heard people say: "Look, sure there's nothing in the Bill that, on the face of it, undermines the independence of an individual practitioner.  Nowhere in the Bill will you find any provision that tramples in any way on his or her independence."  It is a bigger issue than that, however.  One must analyse the authority, for example.  The method of appointing the authority is essential to ensure the independence of the profession.  The question of how the membership of the authority is appointed is not an incidental issue and nor should it be taken as a criticism.  I do not believe there is any place for criticism of the Minister or the Government in regard to it.  It has to do with the manner in which people perceive that authority.  They need to understand and appreciate that it is entirely at arm's length from the Government and that it is independent not just in the operation of its functions, which one would assume, but in every way.  There should be no sense on the part of any authority members that it is beholden to the Government.  There is no intention on the Government's part to make it so.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I am often struck by the analogy of the newspaper proprietor and the editor.  How many times have we suspected that newspapers are following the diktats of a proprietor?  One hears editors on television saying: "I've never spoken to the proprietor of this newspaper.  He has never picked up the phone to me, and I've no idea what his views are.  He's never sought to communicate his views to me."  That does not answer the question, however, because if the newspaper editor and others working there believe their positions, even in remote circumstances, could be under threat - in this case, for example, authority members believing that their survival was dependent on the goodwill of the Minister of the day - that is not good.  Those circumstances should not be allowed to obtain.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Minister is open to amendments on the means of appointment to the authority.  It is necessary to amend the provision.  There are many ideas on how this can be achieved.  Other professions, including the medical profession, have a good statutory regime for the appointment of the independent regulator in their cases.  These are the parallels we should be looking at.</p>

        <heading>Health Service Plan 2012: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic, in which there is much interest.  There is concern in various sectors about the development of health services and associated policies.  I will restrict my remarks to three areas that do not get attention and in which I have a personal interest - carers, orthodontic care and childhood obesity.  I have raised the latter with the Minister previously.  I represent a constituency in the midwest and while there has been negative criticism recently about acute services in the midwest, the vast majority of services in the midwest are operating very well.  I have had the misfortune from a family point of view to have to use the acute services in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and the ambulance services in the midwest region.  We are very fortunate to have the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Dooradoyle, County Limerick, along with the support services available.  One cannot understand the impact of the health services or the work people do until it comes to one's own door.  On 29 November 2010 I was working as a primary school teacher and within an hour of taking the roll of children in my care, I was sitting in the back of an ambulance with my father, who had experienced a number of strokes and heart and lung related problems.  That day changed my life and the life of my family.  It left us with someone in permanent need of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Many of these discussions forget the carer.  It is not just the life of one person that changes with this sort of incident, where someone's independence is removed.  It also affects the person who looks after these people, in many cases the partner, spouse or wife.  I had no real understanding of the work carers do until I started to live with one.  It is a difficult, silent role and it goes unnoticed.  The reason is that carers are withdrawn from their daily lives and contact with the outside world and their lives suddenly change.  Their lives revolve around the people they care for, as they are there 24 hours a day, seven days a week without a break.  The hours provided by the State, not-for-profit organisations or profit-making organisations, in looking after the person and giving the carer an hour to collect the pension, go to the shops or just get a bit of downtime, are invaluable.  It would be easy to say that home care packages and home help cost the State a certain amount of money but we cannot put a monetary value on it unless one experiences the impact the removal has on a person's life.  I understand the country is in dire financial circumstances, as has been well enunciated.  For the people who built the country and on whose backs the country was founded, it is a sad reflection on where we have come from and where we are going that we must examine the services available to a group of vulnerable people who have lost the right to have a say because, in many cases, they are unable to exercise the franchise.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">There has been much talk about the community hospital network in this country in recent weeks.  It is very easy to throw out the idea that hospital care and care of the elderly within the community hospital network is expensive compared to private nursing homes.  Examining it on the basis of the number of patients and the amount of money going into each sector, is a fair comparison.  However, when one peels back the money and looks at the patient or resident, many of them have complicated medical needs and have been discharged from acute general hospitals.  They are in need of ongoing care, including rehabilitation, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy or intensive care following a stroke or serious head injuries.  In my area, we talk about bed numbers, trolley numbers and the occupancy of beds while there is a network of community hospitals around the country that are not being used to their true potential.  There is a temptation to look at them only in terms of longstay beds when, as the Minister said, the best thing for community hospitals is to focus attention on getting the person back to independence or semi-independence and capable of returning to the home, with ongoing care from the State services.  This should include home care packages in order to restore someone's dignity.  The loss of someone's dignity is something that cannot be quantified.  It leaves a huge mark on a family when it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I refer to orthodontic care of children.  It is a shame the Dental Act was passed in 1985 and allowed persons to be appointed as dental technicians to clear the waiting lists but it has not been advanced.  The legislation has been passed but we have not made regulations that allow it to be rolled out.  We can contrast what is happening in Ireland with Wales, Bulgaria and other European countries.  We are light years behind them because reforming the Dental Council has not happened fast enough, there is no chief dental officer and we need a joined-up strategy on how this will be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">One can talk about the cosmetic element of orthodontic care and it boils down to a cosmetic function for some people but it is a huge problem for young people of 14 or 15 years of age.  It is not the only problem because there are complicating factors.  Young people are exposed to all sorts of peer pressure and families must spend thousands of euro every year to try to avoid waiting lists to get braces.  The Minister and the Minister of State have responded to me on this point and are conscious of the efforts required but it needs to be prioritised, particularly for families struggling to make ends meet.  The cost of braces and ongoing care can be between €10,000 and €13,000 and people cannot afford this crazy money.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I refer to childhood obesity.  We have a national advocate in the Road Safety Authority in the person of Gay Byrne, who took on, without fear of control from Government, politics or State agencies, the need to drive down the number of people being killed in road fatalities, which has worked successfully.  We now need to consider the appointment of a personality outside politics and the public arena who young people, in particular, would have an appreciation and respect for to drive a national campaign in this country to address the massive issue of obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It is like a timebomb waiting to explode in this country in terms of the illnesses that are being stored up such as diabetes, obesity-related cancers, heart disease, asthma and others.  For a health service developing in the future, one of the largest problems we have buried beneath the carpet waiting to cause huge problems for the Exchequer and the long-term ongoing health needs of the country is obesity.  If I could make one proposal, it is that the Government consider the creation of a post of national obesity advocate to drive national policy and the implementation of same, and hold the Government to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">In five years time we should be able to say we have achieved something and are taking the issue seriously, as is happening in the United States . I again thank the Minister for the opportunity to speak today.  The implementation of the health service plan is dear to all our hearts.  Much has been said in the past 24 hours and if the Minister takes it on board we will have a much stronger and more vibrant health service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_204">This is an important topic.  Given the title Health Service Plan 2012, one might think this is a great step forward and strategic advance to reform the health service, but it is patently obvious on any reading of it that is not the case and underneath inoffensive sounding words such as "amalgamation", "synergies", "cost efficiencies" and so on the reality is that this is a continuation of the butchering and decimation of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The document does not hide that.  The so-called plan will clearly have a major impact on front line services.  We have to consider the points made by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, when he was in opposition.  He said: "It is outrageous for the Minister or the HSE to suggest that there will be any improvement in capacity or service quality in light of the cutbacks that have already been implemented and the further cutbacks to come."  The same man, in his ministerial robes, is doing exactly that.  He is making cuts to cuts that he is on record as opposing and is making the situation worse.  It is a real problem for hospitals and service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Things were pared back to the bone and now the bone is being eaten away.  When we talk about a reduction of 4.4%, we have to consider it in the context of the cut's that have been made and the deficits being carried forward by many hospitals which already could not cope.  In that sense the cutbacks are more like a doubling of the figure.  We completely reject the inference that the health service is bloated and that there is a fundamental problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The health service has already lost almost 9,000 employees since 2007.  We are not talking about bloated fat cats at managerial level losing their jobs.  In the Minister's plan, 1,600 nurses will exit the system, compared to 200 administrative staff.  I am not saying the administrative staff do not deserve to keep their jobs but where is the serious analysis?  Many hospital consultants are already on the record as saying that people will die as a result of these measures and cutbacks.  To listen to the Minister speak on the Private Members' debate yesterday about how we will deliver better services with fewer employees was nonsense.  No squaring of any circle could be completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">When the document refers to activity levels falling by 6%, what the Minister is really talking about is longer waiting lists and people being kicked to touch.  It is not a solution, it is a kind of cover-up.  It is the same mentality that says the numbers on trolleys can be reduced if people are taken out of accident and emergency wards and moved to different corridors, which means they do not count in the figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">While this is happening in the centre of the health service, home supports are being cut back.  The document refers to a 4.5% cut in home support hours.  When that is aligned with the chronic difficulties people have in accessing carer's allowance, one can see it will result in the worst of all worlds.  There is a slash and burn policy across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Everybody knows there is a crisis in the health service.  Rather than taking the opportunity to develop and review our approach, we are being served up a diet of more of the same.  It has often been said that we can judge a society by the way it treats its most vulnerable, elderly and sick.  If that is the case this Government would face indictment for crimes in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The situation that is unfolding with regard to care for the elderly is disgraceful.  Like all aspects of health service, it is not that we are not spending enough money, rather it is that huge amounts of money are being siphoned off into the private sector and private medicine in an unfair and unequitable situation that sees those who need care most being penalised.  It is scandalous.  This Government should be ashamed of the situation facing nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Hardly anybody was in private nursing home care 20 years ago in Ireland.  We now have a situation where two out of every three elderly people in nursing homes are in the private sector.  The Government wants to further that trend by axing another 1,000 beds from the public nursing home sector.  It is a ridiculous situation.  We have seen figures bandied about to the effect that the private sector is much more efficient and it only costs €850 a week to keep somebody in a nursing home.  Public nursing homes can cost anything from €1300 to €1800 a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Those flippant figures have been categorically exposed by the Ombudsman.  Like with like is not being compared.  The service provided by public nursing homes is far more comprehensive whereas the private sector cherry picks people and turns away those with high dependency needs because they are not profitable.  The fact that the Government stands over a situation where there are no minimum staffing requirements in nursing homes is a disgrace.  Private nursing homes can recruit fewer of the more highly skilled, higher paid nursing staff and have more low paid carers, which benefits them financially.  It is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The level of service being given to elderly people is far more comprehensive.  The Minister should answer on some of these points.  Why are we going in that direction?  Let us look at what is provided.  The Crooksling nursing home in Brittas has the highest number of high-level dependency patients.  Some 84% of the elderly residents in the Minister's constituency require the maximum level of care.  Medical staff in Tallaght Hospital would say the alternative for such people would be a hospital, such is the level of care they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">They are getting excellent care in the facility and the Minister will say it will not be closed.  The residents in the area know full well that is a lie.  People are positioning themselves strategically to continue to undermine the facility by ordering Tallaght Hospital not to refer patients to the nursing home in order that a situation can be orchestrated whereby as the current elderly patients exit the system nobody will be there to replace them.  It will make it look like the facility is more expensive and it will be shut down.  Meanwhile, private nursing homes which have been given massive tax breaks and subsidies by the Irish taxpayer, which are operated by the likes of Dermot Desmond and friends, earn millions in profits.  It is a crazy situation.  The net result is not only the lining of the pockets of private individuals and reduced care for citizens; it is also causing problems for hospitals.  Since Tallaght hospital, for example, cannot refer patients to Crooksling, it must accommodate 22 maximum-dependency patients who really should be in the nursing home.  The Government will not let them go there.  This is more of the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">While many people celebrated the ring-fencing of the €35 million for mental health services, it is quite clear that there has been a cut in this area.  We all acknowledge that, with the extra strain and stress of the current economic crisis, any failure to increase the budget for mental health services represents a cut because a considerable number of citizens need to gain access to those services.  This needs to be attended to very carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">My last point is on private health care.  We need a single-tier public health service.  Many citizens can no longer afford private health insurance; some 47% of people have had it.  The only reason people have private health cover is because they do not believe their families will receive adequate care without using it to jump the queue or enter the system.  The system is completely wrong.  We should use our tax system to have a proper publicly funded health service, and we should not give moneys to private insurance companies or adopt the Dutch model, which has cost citizens a considerable sum of money over the years.  Our health service is excellent when people get into it but we are not joining the dots, however.  A significant aspect of the ongoing problem is the lack of adequate investment at public level.  The Minister is missing a valuable opportunity to use this debate to transform circumstances.  In reality, he is doing exactly what he criticised his predecessor for doing; he is cutting further into the bone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
          <p eId="para_218">I concede that, in the past, the dots were definitely not joined up.  Consequently, we are facing one of the biggest crises to have challenged society.  In the programme for Government, there is a plan for the health service.  There is more planning now than ever before.  A plan was absolutely lacking under the last Government because it threw bad money after bad decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">For the first time, we have a clear agenda for the development of community-based services.  We all know there are considerable constraints and that all the reform will have to be cognisant of the target of cutting costs by €750 million.  I acknowledge the difficulty but welcome the developments concerning children and families, mental health and primary care.  The Government failed absolutely in the latter area, including in my constituency, Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Of the pilot projects that were supposed to have been rolled out under the last Government, a measly 11 were carried out successfully.  There is a continuing problem with access to acute hospital services because primary care is not being offered as it should be.  I have every faith in the ability of the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to make progress in this area throughout the lifetime of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, outlined some of the goals of the plan.  They are very ambitious.  It is hoped that no hospital will have a waiting period of more than 12 months.  As a new Deputy, I realise this is one of the most serious issues to be placed on Deputies' desks.  Deputy Daly touched on it when she said the system is second to none when one gets into it but that the problem is trying to access it.  I welcome the Minister's ambitious targets in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">With regard to reform, I welcome the decision to establish a separate agency to deal with child protection and family services.  These have been an issue for many years.  The previous Government failed to deal with it and, unfortunately, there have been some very serious and unfortunate deaths of young people because of the failures in the system.  I do not blame the workers in the system.  I worked on the front line as a social worker but noted the system itself is broken.  The Government has acknowledged that this is the case and it is willing to take a chance and put €40 million towards establishing child protection and welfare services to ensure best practice regarding these serious matters, which affect some of the most vulnerable children and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It would be remiss of me, as a Waterford Deputy, not to outline my very serious concerns about the south east and Waterford Regional Hospital.  Last week the details on the forthcoming cuts that are to affect Waterford were made known in my constituency.  We must wait for another couple of weeks, or perhaps one week, before they are made official.  A few years ago, Waterford Regional Hospital was lauded for its value-for-money approach.  It has the lowest staff-patient ratio of any major hospital.  Recently, it passed with flying colours in respect of all the HIQA standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Waterford Regional Hospital has been neglected over the years in terms of funding for the development of services.  Annually the hospital treats up to 200,000 patients on a budget of €145 million.  St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin treats approximately 184,000 patients on a budget of €250 million.  Cork University Hospital, which is just down the road from Waterford, treats a very similar number on a budget of €277 million.  What does this mean for the people of Waterford?  In 2010, a decision was made to split the administration of the south-east area.  There are now two integrated service areas which is a mistake because south Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford are all vying for the same pot of money.  Consequently, Waterford Regional Hospital has a lower number of staff and a smaller opportunity to treat people.  The split across four sites gives rise to an issue of hospital governance.  I am eager to hear from the Minister his plan to address the administration of health care in the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">At present, Waterford Regional Hospital is facing considerable cutbacks.  Acute medicine, above all, is under serious pressure.  The facility in Waterford, which is not well funded owing to a historical problem which I acknowledge, is to suffer from the same cuts as other hospitals with vast resources.  Therein lies the inequality and my dissatisfaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The problem is such that Cork University Hospital, which treats the same number of patients as Waterford Regional Hospital annually, has five pain consultants while Waterford Regional Hospital has one.  In St. Vincent's hospital, there are six cardiologists while Waterford Regional Hospital has two.  I ask the Minister to consider this.  A crude cut of 3% or 4% across the board will mean Waterford Regional Hospital will be further punished for delivering in respect of good practice and savings.  It was asked to achieve the savings but it is now being punished for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Waterford Regional Hospital is facing the closure of wards and theatres.  This reinforces regional inequality because those living closest to Dublin and Cork have a vast number of services on their doorsteps by comparison with those in the south east, which is facing very serious difficulties owing to high unemployment rates and job creation difficulties.   This problem, on top of everything else, is of great concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Waterford Regional Hospital, despite its cost-saving measures and low number of staff, was one of the hospitals that met all the HIQA standards.  If the cuts go ahead, where will it leave the hospital and its patients, my constituents, in terms of their being able to gain access to safe health care?</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The welfare of people in the south east is under threat.  I implore the Minister to examine this because of the manner in which Waterford Regional Hospital was disregarded by previous Governments.  This needs to be put in context by the HSE and the Minister when implementing the plan over the coming 12 months.  The south-east region, served by Waterford Regional Hospital, is the only region in the country that has no palliative care services.  I have seen a letter written prior to the 2007 election, and signed by Mr. Bertie Ahern, promising the people of Waterford a palliative care centre but that was never delivered upon.  I ask the Minister to consider the grave need of people who face challenges in regard to looking after very sick people.  Nobody needs to be told how emotive it is to have somebody in one's family challenged with a very serious illness and faced with death while not having a palliative care service or unit in the area.  I make that plea to the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_230">I welcome the chance to speak on a number of issues around the HSE health service plan for 2012.  I will begin by considering the whole area of medical cards.  All of us in our constituency offices are dealing with the unbelievable backlog that has arisen whereby an anticipated and targeted 15-day turnaround is now close to 15 to 20 weeks.  While the staff in Finglas are doing a very good job in very difficult circumstances, I want to give an example of what we are dealing with.  A constituent of mine, an elderly gentleman, through diabetes was forced to have a leg amputation, although he was lucky enough to have a good family around him.  He submitted a medical card application last September.  I checked the details with my office earlier today.  Since September, we have exchanged 20 pieces of correspondence with the central processing unit's client registration office about this gentleman.  On five separate occasions, his family and ourselves submitted information that had been previously submitted and then once again requested.  This man is missing a leg and is dealing with consequences of that as well as being diabetic and suffering from other conditions.  Yet, we cannot sort out a medical card for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Everybody in the House probably has similar stories as to what is happening in this regard.  With a local office, at least there was some element of local intervention in such a case.  Under the Croke Park agreement, I have always felt there should be a core of staff who would move into areas where there are shortages, demands and pressures, such as in this case, to address backlogs before moving away to another office - we would almost have a small army of people to address backlogs in given areas.  None of us can stand over a system that waits five or six months to issue a medical card to a person with diabetes.  The plan anticipates that 100,000 extra medical cards will be issued this year, which is probably inevitable given the economic circumstances.  If the delays continue as at present, what system is in place to deal with this extra avalanche of applications that will come during 2012?  The HSE attended the Committee of Public Accounts and made all sorts of commitments.  The proof will be in the pudding.  I ask that urgent attention is paid to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">There are many ambitions and aspirations within the plan in regard to care for the elderly.  Again, the plan often contradicts itself, as the Minister in his public statements often contradicts himself.  He said at the health committee that community nursing homes with less than 50 beds are not viable, despite the fact this would include the majority of such homes in the country.  We are cutting back on community nursing homes and the number of beds within them.  The fair deal is apparently funded until the end of March.  What happens beyond that date?  If a person cannot get a community bed, he or she may not be able to afford a private bed.  We are cutting home help hours and home care packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">What message is being sent out to elderly people who may need a bed, perhaps temporarily, or may have to make the choice to move into a home?  There are so many different messages.  We are cutting every kind of supply to them.  Many Deputies have spoken about the role of community nursing homes and community hospitals.  The fear among all Deputies and the community generally is that many will close because of the policies the Minister seems intent on pursuing.  Before this plan was published, I questioned him on several occasions on this model he has of money following the patient.  What does that mean for community nursing homes and district hospitals which do not have the necessary throughput of patients because they are going to the general hospitals?</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I pay tribute to the management and staff of Mayo General Hospital who have put enormous work into transforming the services and the standard of delivery at the hospital in recent years.  We have a hospital we can all be very proud of.  However, it only works, and the standards and transformation only work, on the basis of having very good step-down hospitals in Ballina, Belmullet and Swinford and having community nursing homes across the county where people can be stepped down into beds instead of having them occupy beds in the general hospital.  There have been 70 bed closures in the district hospitals and the community nursing homes since last September.  How can the management of Mayo General Hospital continue to step people down to beds that no longer exist?  This will put the pressure back on the general hospital, waiting lists will increase and we will be back into the same ring-around.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Deputy Conway spoke about joined-up thinking.  There is no joined-up thinking when one cuts off the funding to feeder hospitals.  I come back to my earlier point.  This all fits clearly into the model in terms of addressing backlogs in our major, general hospitals.  However, the model the Minister is pursuing of money following the patient will cut the legs from the ability of the feeder hospitals to form part of that model in time to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I have spoken previously in the House about services at St. Joseph's Hospital in Ballina.  I understand the Minister is involved in putting together a plan to save beds through the use of home helps in the hospital, although I gather this is still subject to union approval.  I ask everybody involved to knock their heads together in order to protect the beds there.  I have not seen anything proposed in regard to the psychiatric unit at the hospital or, indeed, psychiatric services generally in Mayo.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Deputy O'Donovan spoke earlier about the need for a national champion on obesity, and he is right that we must have such a person.  Far more fundamentally, however, we need a national conversation or debate about mental health.  We need people to stand up and say that they may have a mental health condition.  I pay tribute to the many people whom we have seen come out in recent weeks and months to say they have had depression.  Mental health is the same as physical health.  As a country, we are great at running to people when they get physically sick and great at providing support, talking to them, praying for them and so on.  However, we are still stand-offish and reluctant to talk about mental health as an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Mental health is the number one challenge facing this country.  When one considers the rates of suicide and depression, we have to put it out there and start talking about it.  To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has done a good job ring fencing money and positions.  Again, however, the issue of joined-up thinking reappears in that the senior Minister does not get it.  Some 400 extra positions have been ring-fenced for mental health teams throughout the country, which is great and something we all welcome, but how many people are retiring or announced yesterday their plans to retire by the end of February from mental health services?</p>
          <p eId="para_239">We were able to run to get Mr. Paul Appleby sorted out and put a package in place for him to wait on to finish his work.  Surely, the 400 positions could be brought forward to make sure there are no gaps in our mental health services when that investment is going to be made later in the year in any case.  It would be a shame to think the investment and the genuine commitment on the part of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, would be undermined by someone failing to knock heads together in regard to sequencing retirements and appointments across the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Minister, Deputy Reilly, when he was on this side of the House, was a great man for throwing every kind of abuse, indeed, much personal abuse, at the former Minister, Ms Harney.  I do not see that much has changed since he came into office except that he is not as voluble as he used to be.  I genuinely wish him well.  Never mind the political issue, health is an issue that affects us all.  However, mighty mouse, as he was when he was on this side of the House, is kind of quiet now as he deals with the realities of being Minister and having to deal with the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I am willing to give him a chance in regard to this plan.  I emphasise that it is his plan.  I love the reference to the "HSE health service plan".  The HSE is in the control of the Minister now.  It is his body, his creation and he intends during 2012 to dismantle it and put up a James Reilly version.  I will give him a chance on this but next year he had better deliver on the targets.  We must see reform that involves better services and better access for people.  We would then see the colour of his money before he starts to bring in his new, Dutch, one-size-fits-all system that has been promised to all as the nirvana of health care.  However, the more one looks into it the less realistic it is.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate.  It is essential we maintain a health service that can meet the needs of every citizen, young, old and in-between.  There are new challenges in the current economic climate that must be met; there are cuts across many services.  This raises the bar for all of us, politicians, the HSE and the clinicians and management teams in our hospitals, as we try to protect the vital services that our people depend on so much in the area of health.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I wish to acknowledge the massive contribution of the health professionals in our health service.  In debates such as this we often hear the negative stories but there are many thousands of positive stories coming out of our hospitals and primary care teams on a daily basis.  There are positive outcomes to health problems with which our citizens suffer.  We often do not hear enough or talk enough about those positive outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Being from Waterford and the south-east region, my main concern is Waterford Regional Hospital.  I heard Deputy Conway's contribution.  Recently, some Opposition politicians have made serious charges about the cuts in the services at this hospital.  Some of these charges are of a scaremongering type and they worry people who are already vulnerable because they are sick.  I do not include Deputy Halligan whose contribution I heard yesterday.  Although he expressed his concerns in a very measured and forceful way to the Minister, he did not engage in the scaremongering other politicians have engaged in in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">There are genuine concerns about the status of Waterford Regional Hospital which serves a region with a population of more than 500,000.  We cannot have a regional hospital in every county.  We hear about re-configuration, re-ordering and reform within the health system but it is important to prioritise our regional hospitals and give them the essential resources they require to meet the demands and needs of the citizens they serve.  Politicians - I include myself - must be very careful because we can be used by vested interests to put forward their often hidden agendas.  Sometimes people are opposed to reform and change.  Lately documents have been leaked from Waterford Regional Hospital.  These were merely unapproved draft documents but they are really worrying the citizens of the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Our hospital services need strategic investment and there must be capacity building in the other hospitals that do less acute work.  I understand consultations have taken place between HSE management and leading clinical managers in Waterford Regional Hospital regarding the health service plan 2012.  That will mean reform and change and the re-ordering of services.  However, it should also mean re-emphasis, re-enforcement and re-investment in new services.  The accident and emergency unit in Waterford, which is always held up as an example of excellence, will get two new consultants, a new cardiologist, a new endocrinologist and an acute medicine physician.  That is a great investment which I wish to acknowledge in the Dáil, especially at a time of recession.  I hope we will see further investment of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">There are challenges for all of us in this economic climate.  I include clinical managers, hospital managers and politicians who must step up to the mark and not resist reform that is for the betterment of our citizens.  We have less money now and more tightened resources and we must make better use of both to protect as far as possible the health service.  The Minister has outlined his priorities.  The special delivery units have already achieved good targets, raising the bar even further.  The Minister has, for the first time, appointed a director within the HSE who will focus on mental health.  I applaud and encourage this.  He is focusing on greater access to primary care and, within a few years, free access to general practitioners for all.  Ultimately, there will be universal health care access for all.  It will be difficult but it is achievable.  We need everybody to row in so we can have a more sustainable health system that is accessible and fair for all our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I have a final point.  A palliative care unit for the south-east region is essential.  Ours is the only region without one.  More than €2 million has been raised locally.  I appeal to the Minister and the HSE to try to make provision for a palliative care unit which has been promised for many years.  It is an essential part of our health service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianWalsh" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Deputy Brian Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_250">It is important to recognise from the outset the scale of the challenges faced by the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE in framing this service plan against the backdrop of required savings of €750 million.  I agree with the Minister's analysis that this level of saving can be achieved this year without a reduction in the level of service activity.  From this perspective the service plan is to be commended.  I also commend the Minister on the progress he has made in the short term in which he has held office, especially in reducing the time people spend on waiting lists and reducing the numbers of patients on trolleys in accident and emergency units throughout the country.  His initiative to introduce special delivery units has assisted greatly in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Let there be no doubt, however.  We are not going to solve the problems of our health service in one year.  I respectfully suggest that notwithstanding his expertise in the area of health care and his obvious competence in health provision, the Minister is not going to be in a position to fix the health service in one term, especially given the legacy he has inherited and the challenges presented by that legacy.  There can be no doubt that the scale of budgetary reduction our economic circumstances demand will impact on delivery of services in certain areas of our health service.  In particular, the imposition of savings outlined in the service plan will have serious consequences for organisations reliant on HSE funding to deliver services in communities to those who can be counted among the most vulnerable in our society.  For these invaluable organisations the true extent of these cuts is in many ways disguised within the pages of the action plan because, by virtue of the Croke Park agreement, they are very much constrained in determining which areas of the budget should sustain these required cuts.  The care provided by these organisations, such as the Brothers of Charity in Galway, with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be familiar, is by nature labour intensive.  As much as 80% of their budgets can be pay-related.  On the face of it, therefore, a 3.7% reduction in funding for such an organisation may seem manageable or even modest but if 80% of that organisation's budget is protected by the terms of the Croke Park agreement, that 3.7% cut must be applied to non-pay items.  It then becomes a cut of in excess of 18% in non-pay expenditure which will have grave implications for the ability of that organisation to continue providing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">There is no fat left for these organisations to trim.  The HSE cleaver is already touching the bone for many.  If the terms of the Croke Park agreement continue to protect the pay packets of public servants without any of the promised efficiency improvements the totality of the burden will be shifted to the non-pay element of these organisations' budgets.  Vital services will be compromised.  The reality is that the Croke Park agreement is not achieving the efficiencies promised.  I hear regularly from health care professionals and consultants in my area, Galway, as I am sure other Deputies do in theirs.  They provide us with examples of archaic procedures which are still being used, for example, in document management.  There appears to be a resistance among some staff in the HSE in our hospital services to embrace new technologies which would encourage and introduce the efficiencies that are required under the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Separately, I wish to highlight a measure contained in the service plan which is likely to pose serious difficulties for one organisation that is very close to the hearts of many of my constituents.  A 3.7% reduction in funding for palliative care in 2012 will impact severely on the Galway Hospice Foundation which already receives a lower proportion of funding per bed than any other hospice in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I previously outlined to the House the inequitable distribution of funding for palliative care services across the country which has resulted in an historic core funding deficit for Galway Hospice Foundation, an issue with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar and about which he has been active.  The shortfall in the State subsidy to the Galway hospice has been supplemented traditionally by generous donations from the public, a testament to the high regard in which this facility is held in the west.  However, a 10% fall in fund-raising last year, coupled with a 7.3% reduction in HSE funding over the past two years, has left the Galway hospice in a position where any further cuts to its budget could result in the undermining of the viability of its services.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">On a positive note, the health service plan notes it will be necessary this year to prioritise some services over others to meet the most urgent needs.  I hope the Minister will agree the Galway Hospice Foundation, as well as the Brothers of Charity operating in the west, are two such services.  It is also noted in the plan that HSE managers will have the scope to vary the level of reduction that will apply to individual care providers to achieve overall savings.  I hope due cognisance will be taken in the case of those providers which have already made significant efficiency savings in recent years and are less well able to sustain further budget cuts.</p>

        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_256">I welcome the opportunity to give my thoughts on this year's health service plan.  However, this two-day debate is concerned with statements.  There are now only four Members in the Chamber.  This is not the proper use of our time.  The health service plan is an important issue which should be debated in committee with HSE officials and the Minister present.  Members should be able to pose questions and get answers on the plan.  If we are to debate the plan, then it should be with those who have the answers and make the decisions on it.  This would mean a proper debate rather than this nonsense of four of us in the Chamber making five or ten-minute statements.  It is not as if we do not have enough legislation to be getting through in the Chamber.  Earlier, we spent just 50 minutes on the Legal Services Regulation Bill, important legislation which the Government tells us must be passed by a certain date because the troika has put down a deadline.  Yet despite spending only 50 minutes on that legislation, we will spend another three hours speaking to ourselves in an empty Chamber with no interaction with Ministers or officials on the health service plan.  That is not what people put us in here for.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Yesterday my constituency colleague, Deputy Dara Murphy, and a little earlier Deputy Brian Walsh spoke about how they believed it is possible the level of cuts implemented by the Minister in the health budget will not impact on front line health services.  Deputy Dara Murphy spoke about the Minister's attempts to address problems in the health service.  I do not doubt the sincerity of Ministers when they talk about reforming the health service to reduce waiting lists, achieve a more cost-effective service and create a responsive one-tier system.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I doubt the Minister's ability, however, to achieve that vision because of the policies contained in this plan and the wider health strategy that he is implementing.  Deputy Dara Murphy stated the Government's target was to have no patient waiting for more than nine hours on a hospital trolley, making it out it would be some sort of an achievement.  Who are we codding with a target of nine hours?  The target should be zero.  That attitude depresses people listening to debates like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I know we are all entrenched in our own political views but we all are passionate about health care and education.  I have no problem with others criticising Sinn Féin's policies or the Government's.  The defensive attitude taken by Members opposite, however, that the Government is right and everyone else is wrong does not help the debate.  We all have good ideas on health care.  If we started working together, we could start moving forward.  Retreating into the trenches and criticising every single alternative put forward by the Opposition does not help.  Yesterday and today, I listened to Government Deputies criticising the Opposition's alternatives.  We do not have all the answers but neither do they.  We must stop this political posturing when it comes to such important issues such as front line services in health and education.  We must get down to brass tacks to do the job for which we were elected, namely reform our political system, get the country back on its feet, create jobs, instead of criticising people for the sake of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Last week, I had the unfortunate experience of ending up in Cork University Hospital, CUH, accident and emergency department with my son.  When we went in, staff there were already stretched with full waiting rooms and a minimum four-hour wait to see a doctor.  After three hours waiting, another trauma case went in which meant it was another seven hours' wait, a total of 11 hours in the CUH.  Not only is this unacceptable but I cannot see how the Government's policies can address these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Government Deputies, along with the Minister, believe they can achieve cuts to the health budget without impacting on front line services.  It cannot be done.  Even the HSE's health service plan states, "Some reductions in services will be unavoidable even with such efficiencies.  These will arise in day service, residential and respite services".  It is about how we prioritise spending our health budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">For example, the medical card system is a fiasco.  I recently had to make representations on behalf of an individual who needed to renew his medical card but did not complete the necessary paperwork in time.  Accordingly, his medical card was cut off.  The individual in question requires medication every day.  However, he has gone several days without his medication because he cannot afford to buy it.  This morning I received an e-mail from the medical card unit informing me it had received the additional paperwork and will revert to us in a couple of weeks.  How can a man who cannot afford the medication he needs to take every day be told he must wait another couple of weeks to get his medical card back?  We all have heard the radio advertisements that a response on a medical card will be made in 15 days but it is not happening.  There is no point in Government Deputies claiming the system is being reformed when the reality on the ground tells us differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The service plan states HSE south will lose 170,000 home-help hours when the same plan estimates the number of people requiring home-help hours in the region will increase.  Yet the Minister and Government Deputies continue to claim budgetary cuts will not impact on front line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">It is not credible to suggest that front line services will not be hit when more people are looking for services and services are being reduced.  I do not know how anybody could try to justify that argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">There are alternatives, however, and it is a question of how we prioritise them.  For whatever reason, this Government prioritised bondholders over ordinary citizens.  The Deputies sitting opposite will say they had no choice in paying unguaranteed bondholders but show me the evidence if that is the case.</p>

It could put this argument to rest once and for all but it cannot do so because it does not have the evidence or legal advice stating that unguaranteed bondholders have to be paid.  It was a political choice and vulnerable people who rely on front line services are suffering as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Prior to Christmas the Taoiseach told the people it was not their fault but then he went to Davos to tell the world it is our fault.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, can shake his head but that is the reality.  The Taoiseach got a pat on the head from Europe for his comments.  That type of cynical politics drives people crazy.  Four Deputies are in this Chamber to listen to statements on health.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">I welcome the opportunity to speak on mental health services in the context of this debate on the health service plan.  Mental ill-health is damaging not only sufferers, their families and communities, but also the economy.  Many of the debates held in this Chamber deal with important economic issues but the current economic crisis also includes social elements.  In 2008, the Mental Health Commission published a report which estimated the direct annual cost of mental health at a staggering €3 billion in 2006.  This is the cost to the taxpayer of decades of Government neglect and isolation of services.  Mental health is central in building a healthy, inclusive and productive society.  Illnesses like depression and schizophrenia can be treated successfully for the vast majority of sufferers and with early intervention people can live healthy lives and fulfil their individual potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">In January 2006, the Government adopted A Vision for Change as the basis for the development of mental health services in Ireland.  The policy framework set out in A Vision for Change, which built upon the recommendations of the 1984 report, Planning for the Future, received nearly universal approval as the best model for a modern, comprehensive and world-class service to meet the mental health challenges facing our society.  However, five years since its announcement there is a lack of progress in implementing the A Vision for Change.  The independent monitoring group reported last July that the specialist services promised as part of the strategy have not been developed.  These include forensic mental health care services, rehabilitation and recovery eating disorder services, psychiatric services for older people, services for co-morbid severe mental illness and substance abuse problems and intellectual disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">A Vision for Change set out a policy framework for the mental health of the entire population.  In addition to recognising the importance of mental health promotion and primary care, it called for a person-centred, recovery orientated and holistic approach to mental health services.  This was a vital recommendation.  It also called for a shift from the current system, which is excessively reliant on institutional care and medication, to a system centred on community-based care provided by multidisciplinary mental health teams.  These teams would include psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and service users, who would work alongside psychiatrists, mental health nurses, psychotherapists and counsellors.  It is that important people with mental health problems are allowed to access the services and supports they choose while continuing to live in their communities, as is their right.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Ireland is more reliant on institutional mental health care than any other country in Europe.  While there are examples of good practice in certain areas, implementation of the plan has been inadequate overall.  Services remain deficient with few complete multidisciplinary mental health teams in place and limited access to community care for the full range of psychological supports that should form part of a modern mental health service.  In 2009, only one in five staff in the mental health service was working in a community setting.  Inpatient facilities remain completely unsuitable, with 15 of the 63 approved inpatient centres dating from the Victorian era or earlier.  St. Joseph's in Limerick was built in 1825.  The Inspectorate of Mental Health Services has described some of these facilities as entirely unacceptable and inhumane.  The position in respect of older people and people with intellectual disabilities is even worse because specialist mental health services in these areas are in need of comprehensive reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Health have honoured their commitment to allocate €35 million this year for community care services.  For the first time there will be a full director of mental health services.  In respect of the €35 million in funding, it is vital that the director is appointed at the earliest opportunity.  In 2006, the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, allocated €25 million for the implementation of A Vision for Change but the HSE only spent €17 million and hived off the rest of the money for other areas.  Only €10 million of the €25 million allocated in 2007 was spent on mental health services, with the rest being used to address deficits elsewhere in the health service.  This was discovered by a health service NGO.  If a director is not appointed immediately, management of the promised €35 million will again be left to the health services and I am not confident it will be used for its intended purpose.  An early appointment of a director of mental health services is required.  Under the present structure of the HSE provision of mental health services is fragmented.  There is an assistant national director with responsibility for mental health policy.  However, the budget for the delivery of mental health services is split across the four regional directors of operations.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention which reports to the assistant national director for mental health has a budget of €4.2 million, yet a further €4.5 million is split across the four regional directors of operations for suicide prevention activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The Government has promised an increase in the direct allocation to the National Office for Suicide Prevention in addition to the €4.5 million.  We believe that an additional €3 million out of the €35 million should go to it.  The €4.5 million that is split across the four regional directors of operations should also come under the auspices of the office so that we have full co-ordination in the area of suicide prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Ireland has one of the fastest-growing rates of suicide in the world.  As a cause of death among young people, suicide exceeds deaths from cancer and road traffic accidents.  We have the fourth-highest rate owing to neglect over the years, therefore it is important that this area is prioritised within the €35 million allocation.  We are not asking for extra funding at this stage.  Some €3 million to €4 million of that should be allocated to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The HSE should immediately produce a detailed plan for the spending of the €35 million to be debated in this House in order to prevent the hiving off of money as happened during the tenure of the former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney.  There should be a single HSE director in charge of this €35 million and that director should progressively move to controlling the full mental health budget, which is €705 million at present.  The mental health services need to have a dedicated management control with the efficiencies the Minister for Health is proposing for the general health services.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
          <p eId="para_282">I thank the Whip of the Technical Group for allowing me the opportunity to speak on the health service plan.  I wish to quote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_283">No one knows more about the changes that need to take place in the Health Service than the experts on the ground ... and they are the managers, staff and their representatives who deal with the day-to-day realities of hospitals, health boards, support services, outpatient clinics, day care and other facilities.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_284">We are now in an era of rapid development in health care and increasing consumer awareness.  To deliver the service we need in the 21st century, we need a new way of working together, a way to cross the dividing lines and pool our resources...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_285">Each local issue that is resolved, each short-term goal reached, is a solid advance in the journey toward a high-quality service for all who receive health care and treatment, and genuine job satisfaction for those who deliver that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">These are not my words, but come from a document published by the former Minister of Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in 2001.  These words give the sense that everything will be fine, but alas not much has changed since 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Nobody will ever but have the highest praise for the front line staff of our hospitals.  One need only read the letters page of any newspaper to see praise rightly heaped upon these doctors and nurses.  Everyone seems to be very happy with the service in our hospitals, once there are admitted.  So where is the problem?  Every day we hear of long waiting times at accident and emergency departments throughout the country, people on trolleys, long waiting lists for procedures to be carried out and morale among staff at an all time low.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">It must be asked, therefore, what is wrong with our health service and why does it not work for the benefit of those it is trying to serve?  Having listened to the speakers from all sides the problem, I believe is not as complex as HSE managers make out.  I put it simply with the acronym BEDS.  I use this term because it is what everyone around this country is telling us and it also stands for better early diagnostic services.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">We need a better community health service.  County Kerry has a network of excellent community hospitals, in Caherciveen, Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle and Listowel with one which remains to be opened in Tralee.  These community hospitals, working with the local GPs, can provide a great service to their locality.  A few extra beds in these facilities used for non-critical medical conditions would immediately relive the pressure on our bigger hospitals.  GPs, who have spoken to me on this subject, have informed me that many procedures could be carried out by the GPs themselves if they had access to these facilities.  All community hospitals should be able to boast of having digital X-ray and video-conference links to their general hospitals in order to enable staff in the wider community to have direct access to consultants and specialists in whatever field may be necessary to carry out a proper diagnosis and treatment schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">However, community hospitals will have to provide a wide range of services for all ages from the youngest to the oldest, including child and family clinics along with physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychiatric clinics, breast-care clinics and other carers' supports as required.  Along with the upgrading of our network of community hospitals, further goals must be put in place for our general hospitals.  The feeble excuses offered for recent ward closures include staff retirements and maternity leave, both of which are well within the bounds of forward planning and should have been flagged earlier so that action could have been taken to deal with the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">A new approach will need to be agreed with all managers on admittance to hospital.  There needs to be co-operation between all hospitals whether they are community or private so that wherever a bed is available it should and must be availed of.  The provision of these community services is the first step in ensuring a health service of which we can and should be proud.  It is only by working from the bottom up that any progress will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">When the Minister for Health was in opposition he used to berate the then Minister for always claiming an issue about which she was asked was a matter for the HSE and not her responsibility.  No Minister for Health who is asked a question in this House should hide behind the HSE - the buck stops with the Minister.  I would like to see the Minister adopt a more responsible and hands-on approach when dealing with questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The issue of medical cards was raised earlier.  There is chaos with medical card processing at present.  I compliment in a special way the people who are working on trying to process the cards here in Dublin.  I am not pointing any finger of blame whatsoever on them because they are dealing with thousands of applications.  However, I have a problem with the policy of dealing with applications from all around the country in a central location.  We had excellent staff dealing with medical card applications throughout the country.  Local representatives and doctors had direct access to the people dealing with the applications and public representatives had direct contact as well.  We knew the names of the people working on the processing of the cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">However, a policy was introduced to centralise the processing of the cards with chaos resulting.  There are people who have repeatedly sent in information by registered post only to be told afterwards that there is no record of the application.  I have the PPS numbers of people to prove this fact if the Minister or anyone else wishes me to back up the claim.  The Minister of State is aware of this and would have encountered the problem herself as would the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  Constituents are being driven to the point of distraction when it comes to applying for a medical card.  I place no blame on those involved in the processing of them as they are simply overwhelmed.  We should go back to the system we had in place for dealing with medical card applications county by county.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I wish to highlight the position of carers.  What has happened recently whereby carers' hours have been slashed and cut is wrong.  The people providing care for elderly people in their homes save the State thousands of euro every week.  If these people were not being cared for in their homes, they could end up falling and then they would end up in a community hospital or in an acute bed in a general hospital.  Keeping elderly people at home is better than having them as patients in a hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Orthodontic delays should be addressed, especially procedures that young people wish to have carried out.  We are all aware that when a young person is developing and if they have a problem with their teeth, it is preferable for it to be dealt with at a young age because as the young person gets older it is more difficult to deal with the problem.  There are considerable delays not only in my constituency but throughout the country.  I wish to see the matter being given the consideration it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">There are certain situations in hospitals such as that prevailing at the community hospital in Dingle.  I appreciate the Minister will officially open Dingle Community Hospital tomorrow and to turn the sod for the new community hospital in Kenmare.  Progress has begun there.  It is ridiculous to have a new community hospital in Tralee with the doors shut, to be paying security guards to mind it and having wards in the magnificent hospital in Dingle which I visited recently.  I compliment everyone on the great work they carry out there and in all our community hospitals.  However, it is nonsensical and penny-wise and pound foolish to have massive infrastructure in place but not to open the beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Deputy Neville spoke about suicide prevention.  I believe no one in the House or in the country has not been touched or affected by suicide and if it did not involve a family member it may have been involved a friend.  Sadly, we have all had these experiences and in my case it has occurred in the recent past.  Resources must be pumped into the issue of suicide prevention to ensure that everyone will talk about the problem.  Ultimately, there is a critical timeframe whereby if a person is in danger and if there is intervention, talk and openness, that person may be taken to a better place and what they might have considered today they would not dare consider at another time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_301">I agree with one point Deputy Healy-Rae made on the processing of medical cards.  This is a universal experience.  Nothing is more difficult to deal with than the case of a constituent who come to a Member and who is only applying for a medical card in the first place because they need it from an income point of view or because they need it from a health point of view.  Such a person is already in a situation of reliance and sometimes they will be in a state of upset.  They put in the application form and, too frequently, I have had to deal with the issue of an application that either has not been received or, if it has been received, the correct use has not be made of it and those involved are unable to track it in the system and cannot give a prompt answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I disagree with Deputy Healy-Rae's comments in respect of the strategy.  I believe the right thing to do is to centralise the system so that one group of people deals with all of it and this group has a system that they can use.  Like Deputy Healy-Rae, I have found that the individuals working in that department are undoubtedly doing their best and are always full of compassion for the people with whom they are dealing and for the circumstances they are managing.  Yet, it is still not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The Minister has acknowledged that more must be done and more will be done to give people a prompt and a more efficient service than they experience at the moment.  It is most important that we do this.  For many people, the main symbol of their involvement with our health system is the fact that they have a medical card and the fact that this confers on them certain benefits to which they are fully entitled.  A speedier resolution of claims and applications would make a considerable difference to the lives of many people in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I refer to three points related to the HSE action plan under discussion.  There is provision in the plan for the measurement of the number of people waiting for more than nine months for scheduled care.  This provision is acknowledged in a section of the report.  The target laid out in the report for this year is that no one will be waiting for more than nine months for scheduled care.  This is laid out explicitly.  A total of zero people will be waiting and 0% of those who apply and who are on a waiting list will have to wait for more than nine months.  It is necessary to set this target because no one should be in a system in which they must wait for more than nine months for necessary care.  It is also an ambitious target in the context of the waiting lists and delays in place at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">This is the singular measure in a long document with a considerable array of indicators and various measures to be tracked.  If progress was made in this respect it would have a significant effect on people's perception of our health system and their ability to get into the system in the time they need.  As other Deputies have acknowledged, the problem in many cases is not people's difficulty with the health system but the difficulty they face getting into it.  I emphasise that this single measurement and the clarity of the objective set down is of considerable value this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Another issue dear to my heart because of the number of times it occurs in my constituency is the matter of children who are homeless, especially youths who are homeless, who have no place to go and who are reliant on the care of the State to ensure they are safe and not exposed to danger.  Unfortunately, we have forfeited this responsibility in the past.  However, I am pleased to see that targets are laid down for what we must do this year and there are several other plans that must be delivered upon.  I was concerned to learn that the main reference beside this target or plan is to establish a base line in 2012.  I would have thought that was already in place and I hope we can establish the ambitious targets in this area and deliver them.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I acknowledge the many good things in the report.  I welcome the final agreement on the building of the new national children's hospital which will start soon and I welcome the completion of the extension of the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, which will provide even better facilities for people seeking to access it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_158">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_308">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I will be parochial in my contribution and I hope it will be of value.  I refer to the Donegal model of community service, assessment and intervention, of which the Minister of State will be well aware.  The model is worth pursuing at a national level.  Having spoken to practitioners within the sector and to stakeholders we should consider the all-encompassing model involving 11 community hospitals.  While one provides community care, the remaining ten provide rehabilitation, assessment, respite and palliative care.  There is so much evidence of good work that sometimes it goes unnoticed in the public domain.  If there is one deficit, it is the lack of recognition of that good work.  I would encourage some reflection on the Donegal model and an intervention by the Minister of State to add value to the national set-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">With regard to assessment, each case is treated individually.  Within the ten community hospitals, we have occupational therapists, public health nurse teams and multidisciplinary teams.  We should emphasise the key statistic in this regard.  Donegal has the highest percentage of people over 65 in the country but the lowest number of people in long-term care.  This illustrates that we have a conveyor belt of continuity, whereby patients from Letterkenny General Hospital move on to convalescence, where the idea is not for them to convalesce in a community hospital <i>ad nauseam,</i> but to get them back into their homes.  This is done through rehabilitation, assessment and working with the families, and that system is working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I want the Minister of State to intervene and examine the designation of long-term beds.  There is no flexibility with regard to these beds and under the fair deal programme, the situation has arisen where community hospitals are losing money when these beds are not being used for long-term patients.  There must be some intervention with regard to the flexibility of the designation of these beds.  This is not about competition between private and community nursing homes.  Private nursing homes probably accommodate about 75% of the needs of older people for long-term care.  However, the community nursing home is vital to the attempt to keep patients moving within the system.  It is not just about taking them from Letterkenny General Hospital and letting them convalesce in a community nursing home.  If they need long-term care, that will be provided and it is right that flexibility should be there.  However, if they need to come home, they need the support systems at home.  They need the support packages through the public health nurse and other community supports.  They should also have the option of returning to the community home for respite care, which they have in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I know the Minister of State is well aware of the Donegal model and that she is up to speed on it.  She must intervene with regard to the flexibility of redesignating long-term beds.  If the onus is not put on the community hospital to move people on, the whole system will become clogged.  Currently, the incentive is to keep them in long-term care in the community hospital and if that is the case, what will happen with regard to the convalescent potential from Letterkenny General Hospital?  What will happen on that journey from broken leg, to hospital, to convalescence, to community hospital, back to the home and return to respite if necessary is that the whole continuum will break down.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, about this, but I make a specific request to the Minister of State today to re-examine the designation of long-term beds.  The incentive should be to keep the system fluid, but that is being prevented currently.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_312">I am pleased to be able to contribute to this discussion because it is an issue on which there has been significant debate.  Much attention has been given to the issue of health services and the Government has made much of its commitment to primary care services and to reducing the demand for acute hospital services by developing community care.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I would like to point out one example of how far there is to go in this regard and I base my remarks on information provided to me by the Irish Heart Foundation.  I am sure the Minister and Minister of State must be aware of this information but we need to put it on the record to make people aware of the situation and of how far we need to move to solve the problems within this particular community.  Stroke is one of the main causes of acquired disability and up to 50,000 people with disabilities resulting from stroke live in the community.  Survivors should have access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy, clinical psychology, speech and language therapy and nutrition and dietetic information provided by both hospital and community-based stroke teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">In 2008, the Irish Heart Foundation's national audit of stroke care indicated the almost complete lack of stroke rehabilitation services.  The audit showed that putative rehabilitation was only available to one-in-four patients or was delayed beyond the point at which it was most effective; continual care and long-term recovery programmes were haphazardly organised or did not exist; the quality of care was determined by chance, location and a haphazard combination of circumstances; and too many survivors were left with unavoidable and unduly prolonged disability.  In 2010, the foundation showed that the direct cause of stroke to the economy amounts to €557 million per annum.  Of this, as much as €440 million, almost 80%, is spent on nursing home accommodation.  Less than €7 million is spent on community-based rehabilitation, which is barely enough to pay for one physiotherapy session per each of the 50,000 stroke survivors.  At least one out of every six nursing home residents has had a stroke.  The lack of rehabilitation services means that we are failing the survivors of stroke and as a result, people who with the right care and support could live independently require ongoing care.  This is an issue that must be examined and addressed, but it cannot be addressed with the huge cuts we face in the health area.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Respite care is also a significant issue, particularly for young people in a respite home in Dublin where staff will have been cut from nine in 2010 to five by the end of February.  This will leave five staff struggling to provide 24-hour respite care seven days a week to 27 families.  They do not have the capacity to do that.  These areas of the health service are being cut right across the board and the situation is not getting any better.  The same is true for the home help service, which is already very thinly spread.  The proposed cuts to this service of 4.5% will soon have the service on life support.  This reduction of 4.5% will mean that 5,000 fewer people will receive home help than in 2008, a cut of 2 million hours from then.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I fail to see how we can make progress with these and other services.  The ones I have mentioned are just the few that came to mind when I thought about my contribution to this debate.  How can we change this when there is to be a cut of €2.5 billion in funding over three years and a reduction of staff of 8,700?  This reduction in staff has affected primary and community-based care in particular.  Home help hours will be cut by 500,000 in the plan.  The IMO and midwives say that 10% of public health nurses will leave under the early retirement scheme.  We face a chaotic situation.  I was very distressed recently when people came to my office in Crumlin seeking my intervention to get them the surgery they need, a hip replacement or to find out why they are waiting so long for this care.  It is a terrible state of affairs when people must come in to ask their Deputies to write to hospitals for them.  It is terrible that people feel they must come to a Deputy because they are not getting the care they need from the hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I was also horrified recently to hear from people who came to me about the difficulties they are having with regard to their loved ones in hospitals waiting for places in nursing homes.  They are having difficulty finding nursing home places and have been told by the hospitals that they will now be charged €1,000 a day for the hospital bed while they are waiting for nursing home care.  That is wrong.  It is horrific that people whose loved ones are already in a stressful situation waiting for nursing home care, and who through no fault of their own cannot get that care due to lack of space, face this.  Then we see that beds in public nursing homes are to be reduced by 500.  It is horrific to think of where we must start from and get to with our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Talk of reform is just talk and our historically underfunded, unequal, two-tier, consultant dominated system has never been fit for purpose.  It will be less fit for purpose after these cuts.  The task of creating a properly funded public health system, with an emphasis on primary and community care and with free, equal access at all levels, can only be achieved when we have a Government which puts people before the profit of these consultants and many private hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The Minister's health plan will not deliver what is needed in the community, and there needs to be a complete change of tack on how we deliver our health service both in the community and in hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">Thank you Cathaoirleach.  This is a very difficult year for the health services.  A Sinn Féin Deputy said in the House yesterday that the Labour backbenchers were staying silent on the health service plan.  I am not a Trappist monk.  The  Government has to face up to the terms negotiated with the troika by the previous Administration.  The challenge for the Government is to mitigate the impact on front line health care services.  There are things in the plan which are to be welcomed, such as the development of proposals to protect the viability of community nursing units; increases in intermediate and community care capacity; a significant strengthening of primary care services; the enhancement of community mental health teams; progression of the clinical care programmes and a more tailored approach to disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The plan requires an outline of the type and volume of services to be provided.  It has to manage the health services in a manner which will mitigate as best it can the impact staff reductions will have on services.  It is essential, therefore, that the focus should now switch to implementing the many reforms which are outlined in the plan and to managing the risks facing the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In terms of staff numbers and pay savings, HSE target numbers were about 104,500 at the end of 2011, which is around 800 under the ceiling.  The ceiling for the end of 2012 is about 102,100, which is a reduction of 3,200 compared to the 2011 target.  I understand these figures are still being finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The scale of the financial challenges facing the HSE, and the resulting staffing challenges, means there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services.  The plan commits the HSE to minimising this impact by fast tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using the reducing resources.  It reflects the need to move to models of care across all services and care groups which treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide services at the least possible unit cost.  It also includes a commitment to addressing staffing levels, skill mix and staff attendance patterns and rosters within the context of the public service agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Under the plan, hospitals will work closely with the special delivery unit to ensure that nobody waits longer than nine months for an elective procedure.  Indeed, nine months can be a long time for somebody in pain.  I certainly hope that their projections are accurate.  I hope there will not be a repeat of the accident and emergency trolley crisis reported to me by constituents late last year, where old people lay on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital for long periods before being moved.  I wish to pay tribute to the Beaumont Hospital staff and to accident and emergency staff in particular, who make heroic efforts to cope with the demands placed upon them.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">In line with the commitment in the programme for Government to a significant strengthening of primary care services, additional funding of €20 million is being allocated to fill as many vacancies as possible.  This will be increased to €25 million if it can be established that there is scope for further savings of €5 million in demand-led schemes.  Funds have also been prioritised for the HPV vaccine programme and the catch-up measles vaccination campaign.   GP visit cards will be issued to long-term illness claimants in line with the programme for Government.  Based on the projected 2012 outturn, an increase of 105,000 medical cards is anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">It is also intended to roll out a national chronic disease management programme for diabetes in 2012.  Preparations will be made for the roll out of similar initiatives for other chronic diseases including stroke, asthma and heart failure.  Outside of the fair deal scheme, home care packages which allow the most dependent older people to remain in their own homes will not be reduced in 2012.  An additional estimated 1,270 clients will be supported under the fair deal scheme.   The HSE will also work with the Department to increase intermediate care capacity by reallocating funding from long-term residential care and potential other sources such as acute hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">An additional €35 million will be allocated to mental health services in 2012, targeted at improving child, adolescent and adult community mental health teams, as well as suicide prevention and counselling services.  In addition, a number of inpatient child and adolescent units will open during 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">This country faces stark choices.  It was the actions of the previous Administration that led us to this point.  Despite all of that, this Government is investing as much as it can, where it can.  There are adjustments in some areas, along with investments in other areas, in order to improve on services and increase provision of services.  This Government is doing its very best to weather this very difficult storm.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurSpring" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing time.  Being the son of a doctor and a nurse, I will not lecture anybody as an expert in medicine, considering I never studied it myself.  However, I feel the public health service should be called the public ill health service.  The problems arise when people with ill health have to access services that heretofore they did not have to do.  I want to take a different slant on this today.  I prefer to deal with rehabilitation and also the prevention of ill health in respect of mental health, obesity, the effects of alcohol, as well as the orthodontic waiting lists in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The medical profession builds up tacit knowledge through practical experience, in the same way we do as politicians.  One of the good elements of the Croke Park agreement is that the profession is now in a position to bring that knowledge to the table and say that this is how it needs to be reformed.  Even though an enormous financial mess was created in the country, good money was spent on health, but it could have been spent a little bit better.  Not only are we going to have to do things better, but we are going to have to do them better with less money.  I will not get into the intricacies of bonds, as some other people did.  There is a deficit and bonds have a minuscule part to play in that.  I will not lecture the Acting Chairman on this, whatever about anyone else.  The health service is going to have to get more bang for its buck.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Croke Park agreement allows the stakeholders to arrange an implementation process on what we can do better.  One improvement I would like to see is in the use of community hospitals and the ability to rehabilitate people and put them back into their homes where they want to be.  We currently have one such hospital in Tralee with 50 beds that needs to be opened.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this on numerous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is fairly crazy when health and education are not working together.  If we can inform kids on how to keep their weight down and live a healthy and happy lifestyle, that would be a very proactive step.  The Department can work on this.  The fact that some children are not allowed to run in a school yard is the most bizarre thing to comprehend.  It is like putting shackles on children.  Medics believe that not only parents but also children do not have the knowledge about this.  There is no point in knowing what year Cromwell arrived in Ireland if they cannot look after their health.  The education system under the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has the capacity to develop projects that will allow people to develop self help in respect of obesity and mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I noticed a few encouraging things at the Young Scientist exhibition at the RDS.  Two Kerry schools - Coláiste na Sceilge and Mount Mercy Tralee - identified that confidence levels among Irish kids were not good and that mental health issues arose as a result.  Doctors have told me that if kids are involved in clubs and have interests and hobbies, they are less likely to have social problems, alcohol and drug problems and, more important, mental health problems.  The students identified ways of making themselves see potential problems and how to help themselves without needing to go to counsellors and the like.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">If one buys a packet of paracetamol, the side effects will be listed.  However, if, on a visit to the supermarket to buy a box of cornflakes, one walks past a promotion for alcohol, which is a lethal substance in some cases, one is not informed about its side effects.  People need to be given such information from a younger age to enable them to make conscious decisions and live healthier lifestyles.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The Carers Association of Ireland is an integral part of the health service.  Carers have looked after members of my family.  They perform an onerous task and save the country a fortune.  It is important, therefore, that they are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Reform will be introduced and must take account of the knowledge of doctors, consultants, nurses and patients.  One of the more enjoyable aspects of my job is being able to respond to members of the public because we have access to the Cabinet and are able to provide Ministers with information on how to make reforms better.  I wish we had more money to fix the health service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_338">Deputy Spring stated that the overall financial context in which the health service plan has been introduced is not related to the payment of bonds.  The implication is that the problem to be resolved is the deficit.  It is important to challenge this notion.  While many of the bonds have been paid, the cost of doing so has been transferred to the sovereign debt.  Nationalising bankers' gambling debts was a mistake and it is the reason the deficit is so bad.  While we also have what is known as a structural deficit, the decision to socialise more than €100 billion of bankers' debts spells disaster for the economy and society.  I still believe we should repudiate these debts.  We must challenge the European authorities and fight on this issue because it is simply not fair or sustainable, either socially or economically, to assume the debts of bankers.  I reject as a starting point the notion that we must accept these parameters.  We must resist them and I will explain the reason it is necessary to do so by referring to one the most important elements of our society, the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">If the cost of taking on the gambling debts of bankers is to inflict serious damage on the ability of the State to provide adequate health care to its citizens - the sick, vulnerable, elderly and young - that price is not acceptable.  It is clear that this is the case as an examination of this year's service plan for the Health Service Executive makes clear the terrible price we will have to pay for this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Health is one of a number of very important areas.  Before I address the health plan, I will first place on record the position as regards the so-called structural deficit.  If we repudiated the socialised banking debt, our deficit would be at manageable levels and we would almost certainly be able to access funds on the international markets because they would consider Ireland a reasonable bet in terms of our ability to repay our debt.  It is precisely because our deficit has been compounded by the gambling debts of bankers following a decision that effectively doubled the deficit that the international markets do not believe we are not in a position to repay our debts and will not lend us money.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We also have the matter of the depleted tax base, which is almost entirely a consequence of the policy pursued for a decade by the Fianna Fáil Party of reducing taxes on wealth and big business to unsustainable levels.  Previous Governments conned people into believing this policy was good for the country because most people did not examine the detail of the Fianna Fáil approach during the boom.  As it transpired, the boom was a bubble for which we are now paying the price.  The way to address this problem is not to slash services but to reform the taxation system to ensure those at the top of society pay their fair share, as they are well capable of doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Having set out my complete rejection of the economic and financial justification for the cutbacks and austerity measures the Government will visit on the health service, I will focus now on the health service plan for 2012.  In summary, the plan attempts to spin and justify terrible cutbacks in the health service which will cause great suffering for the most vulnerable sections of society.  The Government is trying to spin it as reform in summing it up with the ludicrous slogan, "more for less".  Neither the Government nor the Minister for Health believe their own slogan, which is merely an attempt to put a brave face on a savage attack on the health service.  Let us be honest, this is a plan to further slash vital health services for ordinary, vulnerable citizens.  I hope the Government will make a clean break by desisting from the type of play-acting the previous Government engaged in when terrible things occurred in the health service as a result of inadequate funds and resources.  At that time, the Minister and his Department blamed the nasty Health Service Executive for everything that went wrong as if the Government could distance itself from the HSE.  Last month, RTE's health correspondent, Fergal Bowers, put it well when he described the Minister for Health's rejection of the initial draft of the health service plan for 2012 as akin to sending a letter to oneself to complain about oneself given that departmental officials make up half the board of the HSE.  The Government should not attempt to abdicate responsibility for the health service.  We are familiar with this policy from the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties.  Let us have none of that.  Responsibility for the delivery of health services lies with the Government and Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The key issue in the health service is whether we have sufficient numbers of doctors, nurses, administrators, cleaners and other professionals required to make the service work.  The crucial element of the health service is to have people with skills in place to help sick people, although resources and infrastructure are clearly also necessary.  If the number of health service workers is cut to the extent set out in the plan, it is utterly preposterous to suggest we will get a better health service.  The "more for less" slogan is dishonest and should be dropped.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Since 2008, the number of health service staff has been reduced by 7,000 and the plan envisages reducing it further, from a current level of 104,000 to 95,000.  This will result in a worse health service.  As the HSE plan acknowledges, cutting €750 million from severely overstretched and inadequate services will result in a serious decline in the quality of the service provided.  HSE management does not believe one can get more for less.  According to the plan, "The issue most directly impacting on the levels of services to which the HSE can commit is the number of staff who will be available next year to deliver our frontline services".</p>
          <p eId="para_345">It is clear it will not be possible to deliver all services at the same levels as previous years.  It only promises to deliver the maximum level of safe services possible for the reduced funding and employment levels, including addressing, in so far as possible, the unstructured nature of downsizing.  In other words, it will do its best but the level of service provision will be considerably less.  It states clearly that efficiencies, about which the Government talks along with restructuring and so on, will not compensate for the loss of front line health care delivery staff in such large numbers.  The estimates here may not even be accurate.  There are already indications, as reported on RTE recently, that rather than the 3,000 whole-time equivalents by the end of 2012 suggested in the plan, it may be 3,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The Health Management Institute said recently that it believes continuing to provide services with the reduced resources available in certain areas will compromise the quality of services provided and will also impact on risk.  That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">We are talking about a health service in which, with fewer resources and fewer staff, there will be less service provision, more suffering and people unnecessarily dying.  That is true also in the mental health area.  If one looks at the situation with Louise Bayliss before Christmas, what was that ultimately about?  Ultimately, it was about cuts in staff and in resources in mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">We are sacrificing the quality of our health service, which is there to protect the sick, the vulnerable and the elderly in our society, to pay back the gambling debts of bankers and bondholders.  That is the truth and it is a shame on any Government that it would allow that to happen.  The United Left Alliance will continue to robustly resist that agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughtonJnr" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_349">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  The provision of health services in what is a very difficult economic situation must be the top priority of this Government and, to this end, there are many initiatives contained in the HSE service plan introduced by the Minister which must be welcomed but concerns remain at a local level as to how these changes will impact on the day to day working of our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The plan provides for the spending of just over €13 billion, a reduction of €750 million in the health spend.  As the Minister said previously, the removal of that money will result in an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services but great efforts have been made to shelter front line services from the full impact of these savings and instead focus on cost-saving across all sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Welcome initiatives in the plan include proposals to protect the viability of community nursing homes, to strengthen primary care services and to enhance community mental health.  Mental health, in particular measures in terms of suicide prevention, is especially important at this present juncture given the high rates of suicide and self-harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Any householder or small business owner will tell one of the importance of ensuring all income is collected and thus the increased focus on tackling uncollected hospital income is very welcome.  I note that very ambitious targets have been set in this respect and an increased rate of collection will result in great savings in the health service generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">One very successful initiative introduced by the Minister is the special delivery unit, SDU.  It is hoped the success experienced to date, where the number of people on trolleys has fallen by 27% since the introduction of the SDU, will be mirrored throughout the country, including in University College Hospital Galway where patients have experienced long delays due to the high volume of patients presenting at its emergency department.  The change instituted in emergency departments by the SDU is one example of how harnessing the knowledge and expertise of the medical personnel at the coalface can result in common sense and cost effective changes to what are long-term practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">This is a very difficult time for people working in the health service and that fact must be recognised.  A large number of staff will leave the health service this year and remaining staff will be faced with requirements for greater flexibility in terms of work practices and work rosters.  To this end, implementing the public service agreement will be crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">In terms of health service provision in the west of Ireland, great care must be taken in respect of changes instituted only last year.  The downgrading of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital has created great difficulty for many people in east Galway and Roscommon and has put considerable increased pressure on the services in Portiuncula hospital in Ballinasloe with no increased resources.  Hospitals, such as Portiuncula hospital in Ballinasloe and UCHG, must be strengthened to ensure they can provide the type of service demanded in the current HSE plan.  I very much welcome the Minister's recent appointment of a new CEO to cover the four hospitals in the region but, as someone who is very clearly linked to one of the smaller regional hospitals, we want to see a very clear plan on how Roscommon, Portiuncula and Merlin Park hospitals will work with the larger UCHG to provide the best care possible for the patient, which is what this is all about.  UCHG is a fantastic facility but it is suffering from delays.  We are sending too many people there when we have these other hospitals which have management and staff who are more than willing to change their work practices to keep those hospitals viable.  That is crucial in terms of the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I note that hospital budgets for this year will be down by an average of 4% on last year's allocation.  This, added to existing deficits, will mean a reduction in expenditure of 7.8% as the hospitals endeavour to get their spending back on track and yet it is expected that inpatient numbers will reduce by only 3% on the 2011 figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Cancer continues to be a scourge faced by thousands of families and individuals in 2012.  It is disappointing to see an anticipated increase of 3% in the incidence of cancer but it must be remembered that an element of this increase relates to better and earlier detection of cancers which, in turn, results better outcomes.  However, dealing with an increase of 3% at a time when cancer care services are already extremely busy will create more pressure on oncology services.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the fact home care packages, which allow dependent older people to remain at home, will not experience any reduction, even though the cost reduction for the budget for older persons, excluding the fair deal scheme, is 2.3%.  Of much greater significance is the reduction of 4.5% in home help hours, even if this reduction will only see a number of people in receipt of home help hours have their allocation reduced by 1.2%.  For those critically ill older people who are being cared for at home, the level of home help available could be a determining factor in whether the family members feel able to cope with caring at home.  Such cuts could put even greater pressure on the fair deal scheme in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Often dry facts and figures mask the real impact the reductions will have.  One example of this is the provision for disability services.  I note the allocation will be reduced by 3.7% nationally and that it is hoped that this will be achieved through greater efficiencies, procurement changes and pay reduction savings as well as the rationalisation of back office costs.  In recent weeks, I have met many people in regard to this issue, among them members of Ballinasloe Advocates Group, a group of parents concerned about the level of services their children will receive in 2012 and in the future.  Members of this group have been understandably very anxious about the consequences those cost reductions may have on the lives of their loved ones, whether in the provision of leisure activities or transport.  They are very anxious that the huge progress made in the area of services for disabled persons is not damaged by the cuts the country must make in order to balance its budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Minister stated that this reduction will result in some small reduction in day and respite services but I urge him, in conjunction with HSE management, to ensure that any such measures are kept to an absolute minimum, in particular cuts to respite services which provide an invaluable service to parents, such as those in the Ballinasloe Advocates Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">At a time when cuts are being instituted right across the board in terms of health, education and other vital services, it is very welcome to see an additional spend of €35 million on improving child, adolescent and adult community mental health teams as well as suicide prevention and counselling services.  The opening of a number of inpatient child and adolescent units is also welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">While the switch away from psychiatric inpatient beds to care in the community is very welcome, it has reflected a historical model of the psychiatric services which had become outmoded.  I note the loss of staff in the mental health services in recent years will result in a further reduction of inpatient beds but this needs further investigation.  Increased use of psychotropic drugs and recreational drugs has led to increased incidents of psychosis and, in many cases, inpatient services are the appropriate way to deal with patients who present with psychosis as opposed to sending them home in the company of family members who have neither the professional knowledge nor skill to deal with such situations.  This issue may require further discussion in future years as we see an increased number of patients presenting with psychosis as people, young and old, continue to purchase psychotropic drugs from illicit sources, including over the Internet.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I again welcome the extra spend of €35 million which has been ring-fenced for this area.  However, for many years, we always considered the health service could be fixed by increasing funding to it.  That was the only way for the Government to prove it was fixing the health service.  We need to see how this €35 million will be spent, whether in the community or through hospitals or organisations.  That is the key here.  It is welcome news but now we need to see how the Minister will spell it out.  How will it affect such people and their families to fight the problem of suicide in the community?  At a time when social workers face immense workloads and the public becomes increasingly aware of child protection issues, a reduction of 7% in child and family services is disappointing.  Social workers are dealing directly with the children most in need in our society.  Every care should be taken to ensure that children are not endangered by this significant funding cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">A reduction of €750 million in this budget will cause great difficulty for people using the health service, as well as those working in it and others making the difficult decisions on funding cuts.  Given the country's financial situation, such cuts are unfortunately unavoidable.  I note that every effort has been made in this service plan to achieve a significant proportion through increased efficiencies and changes to procurement processes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_365">The €750 million reduction in this year's budget from the 2011 budget allocation is a dramatic shortfall, which imposes a great challenge to delivering an adequate service in 2012.  Of immediate concern is the anticipated loss of 3,500 workers under the redundancy scheme by the 29 February deadline.  A huge mistake was made when the redundancy package was announced because guidelines were not specified and neither were the numbers of people being allowed to avail of the package in each health care discipline.  It seems we will have deficiencies in some hospital sectors.  For example, rumour has it that a disproportionate amount of nurses in some specialties are applying for redundancy.  There is also an overdraw in midwifery.  The HSE report admits to the unstructured nature of exits for different services.  The report also refers to a replacement factor pay model of €16 million for critical posts.  The report admits that this represents a very limited capacity to address what will no doubt be critical gaps in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Existing staff will be overloaded and thus under strain in coping with additional demands.  The HSE report also states that agency staffing is to be reduced by up to 50%.  It is clear that the Minister for Health will have to devise some contingency plan for this situation.  Due to the negative impact on health services, there is an urgent need to review the embargo on recruiting graduate nursing staff.  Even if they were only to be employed on a part-time basis to deal with what I predict will be a mini-crisis, it would ease the dilemma as well as giving these graduates with excellent qualifications an opportunity to pursue their careers in their own country.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I welcome the additional €55 million for nursing homes, which is additional to the sum of €1.049 million already provided for the nursing home support scheme, which is better known as the Fair Deal.  This sum should be concentrated on public care homes, rather than private ones, as well as semi-public and voluntary care establishments.  Valentia Community Hospital, which is in receipt of financial support from the HSE, should also benefit from this additional allocation.  It would enable it to continue its high quality service to that island community and the surrounding catchment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">There are rumours circulating that a disproportionate number of long-term beds for the elderly will be taken out of service.  This is causing widespread anger and concern among people in County Kerry, so the Minister should clarify the matter.  District community hospitals, including St. Columbanus's nursing home in Killarney, have provided sterling service to the senior citizens of the county over many years.  Following improvements to upgrade such facilities, it would be totally out of order to interfere with these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">It is estimated that some 23,611 clients will be supported by the nursing home scheme by the end of this year.  This is an increase of 1,270 from 2011.  We definitely have adequate beds in our public institutions, such as those I mentioned earlier, but there should be no further drift of spending to private hospitals at the expense of public ones.  I welcome the fact that Kerry General Hospital in Tralee and Kerry community hospitals combined with St. Columbanus in Killarney, had no budget deficits last year.  This merits enhanced funding based on their performance and high standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The allocation for disability services is being reduced this year by 3%, which is downright uncivilised.  It will lead to further neglect and deprivation of essential back-up services for the most needful in society.  The 14-month waiting time for appliances for such people in the Kerry-Cork region is unwarranted and unacceptable.  It should be dramatically reduced as it is inconvenient and stressful for people waiting for prostheses or second skins, for instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I welcome the €1 million for autism services, which for a long time were deprived of necessary funding.  These moneys should be further increased next year to develop early intervention teams.  Autism needs to be addressed step by step in the coming years in order to provide the attention it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The additional €35 million for mental health services is also welcome.  The recruitment of 400 staff nationwide is most positive for these services, which are faced with increasing demands daily.  The Minister should proceed with the closure of St. Finian's Hospital in Killarney and finalise arrangements for alternative accommodation at an early date.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I commend the development of primary care services, which are wonderful, progressive developments throughout the country.  I ask the Minister to progress with the HSE the further provision of primary care services, which are most beneficial for rural communities and particularly for people living alone in isolated areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I am glad of the opportunity to discuss health funding.  It is the first health debate in which I have participated since being elected to this House.  I want to make a couple of points to the three Ministers in the Department of Health.  In our current economic crisis, most publicity is placed on the difficulties facing Ministers in the Department of Finance.  The job of Ministers in the Department of Health, however, is an onerous one and it is all the more difficult given reductions in expenditure across the board.  I wish them well in what is a very difficult task.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I wish to comment specifically on a couple of areas concerning the HSE's national service plan for 2012.  I echo what was said earlier by Deputy Paul Connaughton who welcomed the extra funding for mental health services.  The inclusion of additional funding for the mental health sector is highly appropriate given the economic crossroads we are at and the commitments given by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in opposition.  Increased funding for this sector has been found at a time of great difficulty to ensure services can be improved across the country.  There has been a change in emphasis in the past ten years in how mental health services are delivered.  Thankfully, more services are delivered outside acute hospital facilities nowadays.  Extra funding will help in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I agree with Deputy Tom Fleming's point on increased funding for autism and primary care centres across the country.  Many people present at acute hospital facilities who could be treated closer to where they live.  They need not become involved in the acute hospital service.  I welcome the additional funding for primary care.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The service plan provides for a reduction in cancer funding.  In my region and others, there has been centralisation of services in the regional hospital, which will result in some savings.  Hopefully the impact on the delivery of service will be positive.  In response to the debate, perhaps the Minister of State can refer to colorectal screening, an issue that has been raised with me.  The HSE, the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State are anxious that this can be rolled out in 2012.  Are there concrete proposals for when it will be rolled out?</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Care of the elderly is close to my heart.  We saw harrowing scenes in Laois where proposed closures of public beds for elderly people led to protests before Christmas.  There is the prospect of a significant reduction in public geriatric beds.  It is not something I support.  I refer to the policy pursued by the previous Government in promoting the private provision of nursing home beds.  It is without doubt that the provision of beds is necessary in dealing with the number of elderly people who require residential care.  I urge the Department and the HSE to do everything in their power not to close 555 public beds in the coming 12 months.  When 75% of the health funding is spent on pay and pensions, it is unjustifiable that savings from the other 25% lead to elderly people and their families becoming involved in protests.  I have regard for the people involved in my local hospital, St. Columba's Hospital, Thomastown, County Kilkenny.  This fantastic public facility provides a home for close to 100 people.  There is no private facility in the region that can match it.  We need to ensure these public facilities are retained.  Whatever savings are made in the overall health budget, I ask that we ensure elderly people are kept in these facilities.  For many people, these facilities are their homes rather than just a hospital.  They live there and build bonds of friendship and affection with fellow patients and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I welcome the initial steps taken by the Minister and Minister of State in the overhaul of the HSE.  We often speak of the economic difficulties passed by the previous Government to the current Government.  One of the unmitigated disasters passed by Fianna Fáil and its friends of various colours in government over the past 15 years is the HSE.  When first proposed, the HSE was in a very different form to the form it has taken in the years of its existence.  We have a bureaucracy that is not delivering a proper service across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">In the response to this debate, the Minister of State can provide information on how the HSE will be further overhauled in the coming months.  As a Member of the Seanad, I remember discussing legislation and hearing that savings would be made because the HSE would deliver a unified service across the 26 counties.  Instead, we saw the creation of extra levels of management and bureaucracy and decisions being taken out of the hands of local decision-makers and centralised, with the result of mass frustration.  This applied to public representatives like me and the general public but also those involved in the service.  People in the south-east region used to make decisions for the south east but they now have their hands tied behind their backs because of an extra series of management levels created above them.  They cannot look after the service in the local area.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Over the years, there was a problem with the delivery of funding for health services in the south east.  The region consistently lagged behind the rest of the country in capital expenditure.  There have been welcome announcements about the provision of accident and emergency facilities in Wexford General Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny but the south east receives less capital funding <i>per capita</i> and substantially lower current funding per patient treated.  That is unacceptable and is not part of what we were told the HSE would be.  We were told there would be the same level of care and the same level of funding across regions of the country.  This has not been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I am not sure funding for rural GPs comes under the HSE national service plan.  I welcome primary care centres but GPs in rural areas operate alone or in practices with one other GP.  There are proposals to reduce substantially the funding for GPs and this will have a serious impact on the delivery of vital health care services in rural areas.  Perhaps the Minister or Minister of State can comment on this in response to the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_383">I propose to share time with Deputy Mick Wallace.  The HSE service plan should be renamed the lack of service plan.  It is being prepared to meet the €750 million reduction in the HSE budget, amounting to a total reduction of €2.5 billion in the past three years.  It is past the point where we should ask ourselves whether we will have a health service in the future.  We cannot continue to keep cutting and the Government cannot expect more efficiencies can be found.  Efficiencies mean treating more people with less every year.  It simply does not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The executive summary of the service plan puts things in black and white.  It is certainly true that it will be impossible to avoid an impact on front line service delivery in 2012.  We all know we cannot continue to cut services and staff, yet operate a service safely.  In the past few days we have learned the plan is out of date.  The announcement that almost 4,000 staff will leave the health service by the end of February and the news that 47 out of 200 midwives will leave maternity services shows the real effect of the embargo and the continued reduction in front line staff.  The public have known since day one that the front line was the target and now at least HSE management is recognising it.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It appears the removal of staff has not been planned for.  In the past few days the Minister said the plan will be put in place, four weeks before staff are due to leave.  There is no doubt the HSE will not act as quickly as the Cabinet did when the Office of the Director of the Corporate Enforcement announced his retirement because front line staff are leaving and only treat ordinary working people.  More and more of the elites are the only people who will have health insurance and will continue to get preferential treatment.  At least the service plan has recognised some of this in trying to address the unstructured nature of the downsizing, but it clearly shows no thought has been put into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Much has been made of the ring-fencing of €35 million for mental health services but in real terms this is a reduction of 1% in the overall budget for mental health services.  Once again they will be the poor relation of the health service and the most distressed people will continue to suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">In terms of services for older people, we will see the closure of over 550 beds in community nursing homes across the country.  In Donegal many beds in community hospitals are under threat, from Lifford to Dunloe and Ballyshannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The plan refers to maximising elderly people's ability to live in the community rather than taking up closed beds.  The number of home support packages will be maintained at the same levels as last year.  Where will people denied a bed get support?  The number of home help hours will be cut in HSE west by 115,000.  There will be no home help for those who cannot get home support.  This makes a lie of the plans of the Minister and HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Letterkenny General Hospital is the second most efficient hospital in the State.  Over 90% of its patients are non-elective.  Yet, the Government still cut its budget by millions of euro.  There will be reduced service levels this year which will mean waiting lists will grow and non-elective patients will not be treated.  What incentive is there for a hospital to be efficient?  Last year the Minister announced Tallaght hospital will have its deficit written off but what about Letterkenny?</p>
          <p eId="para_390">With the reduction in activity levels in hospital services large numbers of staff will also leave primary care.  The service plan states patients should be treated in primary care rather than hospitals.  How does the HSE expect this to happen?  Surely staff are needed somewhere if one area is needed to pick up the slack when another service is reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The HSE is already cutting out of hours GP services in Donegal and a reduction in primary care will be caused by retirements.  This is combined with the cuts in home support, which is servicing the same number of patients as last year.  The burden of home help hours will have to be taken up somewhere.  We will see the blocking of hospital beds because many patients will simply have nowhere to go.  This will lead to further reductions in treatments and place a bigger burden on primary care.  The vicious cycle will continue.  There is no doubt the HSE service plan and lack of services will take up many hours of debate in this House as the full effects of the cuts are felt across the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_392">The general nature of the plan is difficult, given that so much money is being cut from it.  It will be very difficult to provide the same services with fewer people.  A strong unknown element is involved.  It must have been difficult to plan for how many people were going to avail of the opportunity to avoid pension cuts.  It appears that 3,500 people will leave the medical profession, a figure made up mostly of nurses and midwives.  Front line staff seem to be getting a hammering more than others.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">One of the priorities for 2012 is to deliver the maximum level of safe services possible.  How will that be achieved in a maternity unit if there are not enough midwives to deal with the number of women coming in?  Given that we have a rising population and there are more births every year but fewer midwives, I do not know how things will work out.  I would not like to be a woman going into hospital not being sure how many midwives were available.  I have never had such an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I heard there will be a review of the situation when the HSE knows exactly how many people are leaving.  It is clear that extra people have to be recruited to certain sections, especially midwifery.  I do not see how the State can take a gamble on not having enough staff on the floor to deal with patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The Government's plan to treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide services at the lowest possible unit cost is fair enough.  The policy of keeping more people in their homes is good and I agree with keeping people out of hospital if they do not need to be there.  However, I am surprised that home care support hours were cut.  The carer's allowance has come under threat through the welfare system.  This is a backward step.  The Government is right to start working towards more home care but I do not understand how it can cut home care services through changes introduced in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Law Reform Commission made recommendations on Monday.  It stated that HIQA should be given additional regulatory and inspection powers to ensure that appropriate legal standards are in place for undertakings providing professional home care.  It seems the Health Act 2007 does not empower HIQA to set comparable standards as it does in other areas for the provision of health care in a home setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Most older people would rather stay at home if at all possible.  If I were 80 years of age I would rather be in my home then go into an institution.  Having said that, it would be inappropriate for the State not to be able to guarantee the quality of home care provided for older people.  The general philosophy behind how we care for our older people needs improvement.  Many other countries would put us to shame in terms of how they look after their older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">In countries in the east and even as close as Italy older people are revered for having done so much throughout their lives and given so much.  They are treasured, hugely respected and far better taken care of.  We need to examine how we approach the care of the elderly and how we feel about them in society.  We need to value them a lot more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_399">I am happy to speak in this debate on the Health Service Executive's national plan.  We spend in excess of €13 billion per annum on health.  If the transition year students in the Visitors Gallery were to listen to some of the Members opposite, they would say we spend nothing on it.  We spend in excess of €13 billion on the public health service per annum.  Can we put that in the context of our current position?  There is an economic downturn, called a recession, which means there is a reduction in the public and private money available to the nation.  Undoubtedly, the budgetary adjustment and legacy deficit make it inevitable that there will be a major challenge for the HSE this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">It is necessary that all stakeholders involved in the delivery of public health services, including the HSE and the Department of Health, work together to ensure budgets are met, that reform is delivered and, most important, that the service is not compromised.  It is undoubtedly a challenge but I heard not a single alternative proposed this morning and yesterday.  If one had listened to Deputy Pringle, one would have believed the world was ending in Donegal, but that it is not going to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">We must prioritise patients and patient care.  The health service is not an administrative system or an accountancy practice.  It is not just a question of balancing books and having a cold computer printout; the service is about patients, the delivery of services and the women and babies in maternity units about which Deputy Wallace spoke.  None of our debates should be about political point-scoring, ranting and raving or whipping up hysteria.  We must be honest about the delivery of a health service that is accountable and manageable and which delivers for the patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, because they are both empathetic and sincere and have a vision.  Their actions are to be seen on the ground, they do not simply engage in rhetoric.  They operate under budgetary constraints.  The special delivery unit has worked.  Last Friday in Cork, I attended the HSE's launch of a retinopathy initiative.  Dr. Diarmuid Quinlan has screened 3,500 people suffering from diabetes to bring about change regarding availability and how the system operates.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, pioneered primary care.  This will have a profound and lasting impact on society.  Mental health has been designated a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Let us examine the trends set by the Government in just 11 months.  We have seen the Minister unfurl a plan for seven new directorates in respect of which accountability will be the key.  We have changed the management structure regarding the grouping of hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">There are a number of trends about which we ought to be worried as a nation.  These include the obesity level, including the childhood obesity level, and the level of alcohol misuse.  I was very pleased that the Joint Committee on Health and Children published its report last week on the misuse of alcohol.  I very much look forward to the report of the independent steering group and to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, in bringing about a new culture and attitude to the misuse of alcohol and tobacco.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Deputy Wallace referred to staffing.  How is it that there has been a 45% increase in the number of consultants employed between 2002 and 2011 in the health service?  Consultants create traffic; they have patients, theatre lists and outpatients.  I look forward to seeing this year a complete realignment of the Health Service Executive.  The Minister of State stressed the need to mitigate the impact of budgetary changes on front line services.  We all accept that.  I call on the HSE to ensure that the allocation of staff across front line services does not mitigate against the patient or compromise patient safety.  This is the duty of the HSE because it is the accountable body in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Deputy Wallace stated front line staff have been hit more than others in essential services.  He may well be right but the reality is also that the Health Service Executive did not have all the relevant figures until some days ago.  When I hear eminent people stating otherwise on the public airwaves, I wonder about megaphone diplomacy and advocacy in that regard.  The last thing we need to do is create hysteria and panic, compromise safety and increase uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce public service numbers.  As we move towards the fulfilment of the criteria in the programme and those set by the troika, having due care in respect of the patient on the part of the Health Service Executive should be deemed essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Just last week, I met representatives of the INMO, front line staff, a group of consultants and some non-consultant hospital doctors.  All of them understand the economic restraints and none is going public.  Each expressed concern over staff reductions, which they fear will have an impact on the delivery of services, particularly front line services.  It is critical that the HSE understands the genuine concerns of many regarding front line staff and puts plans in place to cope with the impending changes.  I look forward to the HSE representatives appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to deal with this issue in a couple of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, have asked the HSE to brief them on the staffing allocations in respect of each budget.  I heard the Taoiseach's remarks on this topic in the Dáil yesterday.  I urge the Minister of State to impress on the HSE the need to preserve the front line positions and ensure the safe delivery of services.  It is important that the HSE spell out the tax savings and efficiencies achieved in the administration of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">While the national service plan does not deal specifically with the budgets for specific hospitals, it indicates the overall budgetary reductions that hospitals face.  The absence of this detail has caused concern for some of us in government.  Those engaged with front-line staff are also concerned.  However, the purpose of the national service plan is to provide an overview, and I hope the direct communications between the HSE and hospitals will provide clarification in this regard.  I call on the HSE to be sincere in its negotiations with hospitals, particularly acute hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Over the past six months, hospitals have worked closely with the special delivery unit, which is one of the key reforming initiatives of the Government that has succeeded and delivered results.  I very much welcome the targets being set by the Minister, which I hope will deliver further improvements in the delivery of service.  We need to manage and review the operation of the special delivery unit and ensure that achieving the target is not at the expense of other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The health system delivers integrated services.  Each element of it needs to function if we are to review the level of care.  The Minister has suggested another efficiency, the grouping of hospitals, which I welcome.  This has the potential to achieve tangible results and can facilitate the pooling of resources and a sharing of facilities to deliver for patients.  In Cork city, it can be used to deliver integrated surgical services and co-ordinated services across all the city's hospitals.  If this model returns some local control to the system and gives those who deliver the service a greater input, it can achieve the results the Minister wants.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Deputy John Paul Phelan spoke about fair care.  It is important we consider this in the totality of the way we treat the elderly.  I will conclude by addressing the area of reform.  As the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, have said, this is a year of reform.  There are challenges facing the health service and these are recognised by all of us in Government.  I challenge the Members of the Opposition to live in the real world and face up to the challenges and responsibilities which being a Member of the Oireachtas brings.  It is not about megaphone diplomacy and shouting and roaring.  They should be real about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">In facing the challenges, it is important to ensure quality services are delivered where they are needed.  I hope the Minister and the HSE will work together throughout that reform agenda because our country is spending in excess of €13 billion.  This requires accountability and putting patients at the heart of the system.  I am confident in this regard.  We have a reforming Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, with us in the House and she has two reforming colleagues.  It is about the patients.  I am happy the Government will bring about that reform, which will deliver real change in our health system.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I am pleased to speak on the health service plan for 2012.  I have the summary of the plan, I would not like to have to read the full document as I do not know how many pages it would contain.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Having listened to the last speaker, I accept the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and her colleagues are genuine about this issue, as is everybody in the House.  The problem I have with the Minister is that he is caught on the hook again.  He told us all he was going to disband the HSE and that it would be no more.  Speaking for myself, I was here for four years putting down questions to the former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Harney.  I wrote to the Taoiseach of the time when Ms Harney disbanded her party to have her replaced with a Minister from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party in order to get answers on different issues.  We were putting down questions to the Minister for Health and Children and they were all being fudged.  The only response was, "Thank you for your question.  This is not a matter for the Minister.  It is for the HSE".</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I believed the Minister, Deputy Reilly, when he said it was going to stop, but it has not stopped.  He tried to stop it for a short time but it is back again now.  I can put down a question to the Minister for Health about serious issues, whether it be medical cards or many other issues of local or national importance,  yet it is the HSE to which I am directed.  The HSE has to be dismantled or fundamentally changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">There are too many people in the HSE.  There are many good people who do a lot of hard, honest work, particularly in front line services.  However, the front line services are being attacked and eroded.  What has happened?  We have the pen pushers making these reports.  They are growing and growing - it is their careers they are growing in many cases.  We have layers upon layers.  We saw what happened when the health boards were disbanded.  All the staff were taken in, with no loss of jobs except in the front line.  It is top heavy with officials.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_420">I accept that.  I am talking about my party in Government, and about what I saw with my two eyes open in the past four years.  I accept that we attacked the front line services and I am ashamed that was not addressed.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, promised to tackle it but he has not.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I could raise issue after issue but the fundamental problem is that the HSE is a big, monolithic organisation that is not fit for purpose.  It should be on the scrap-heap.  It should be totally disbanded because it has grown lazy, lethargic, inept and, above all, it does not answer to any public representative or this House.  That is the shameful aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Acting Chairman, Deputy Tom Hayes, knows what I am talking about.  We have been dealing with different managers in hospitals in south Tipperary.  We are told one thing today and a different thing tomorrow.  They move off to different careers.  They move off to a reconfiguration service.  They are no longer working for the hospital.  They are there and getting paid out of the budget but they are now working for the reconfiguration part of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Reconfiguration - it is a wonderful word.  They create new words every couple of years to justify their jobs and their positions while pillorying the ordinary people of this country and deny them the basic services they are entitled to and had ten years ago.  Take the mental health aspect, on which there is a spend of €55 million.  Mental health services have been the poor relation for decades.  We all voted for A Vision for Change, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, reminded me.  Of course we did.  We welcomed it because the draconian institutions must be closed and services moved on.  However, part of the draconian institution that was closed in my town is now plush offices, more lavish than the Minister's office in this building.  The walls are adorned with big paintings and pictures of previous officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">This was hijacked and plundered by people who wanted to enhance their careers and to hell with the service.  These people arrived in from a different land two years ago and told the board of South Tipperary General Hospital at a Tuesday night meeting that they were closing St. Michael's psychiatric unit - off the agenda - without any discussion, consultation or otherwise.  The consultants and board present were shocked and contacted the local Deputies.  Nonetheless, the director came on the radio on the Thursday and announced it publicly because the consultants had leaked it.  Is that respect for consultants, staff or elected representatives, including county councillors who had served on the Southern Health Board?  It is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">This issue is still continuing in our town and, more importantly, in our county.  They hived off all the north Tipperary patients and told them they had to go to Limerick.  The north Tipperary representatives fell for that, which surprises me, but that is their business.  Now, it is found they have not gone to Limerick but instead have gone to Ennis, although the people of Ennis have enough to put up with.  I recently spoke to the Labour Deputy from Ennis and he complained about beds being inaccessible for his own constituents in Ennis because there is no space.  It is playing with figures but, more importantly, it is neglecting and failing to treat people as human beings and as honest people who have worked and, for whatever reason, ended up in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">What is going on in south Tipperary at present is an outrage.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for at least yesterday acknowledging the facts in regard to closing acute psychiatric beds in St. Michael's unit.  There is no comparison with St. Luke's Hospital, which we agree should be closed and, for that matter, should be bulldozed.  However, they will not bulldoze it because they have big offices inside for their own people - some of the offices are as big as half a ward.  It is madness.  That is where the money was spent, not on the beds, not on patient services, not on outpatients and not on more psychiatric consultants, where it was needed.  It was spent furthering their own careers in fine, plush surroundings.  It is an abomination, a disgrace, a travesty and an injustice to the public of this country.  That is what has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Then we have reports like this one.  They would not fit in the Custom House, all the reports that have been done on different hospitals - this report and that report, and paying experts and consultants to come in to prepare them.  I do not mean medical consultants but outside consultants, enough to keep an industry going.  That is what happened.  They took the eye off the ball and left people waiting for medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Whoever made a decision to move the medical card system to Dublin should be sacked.  It has been a disgrace of a system.  While I will not say they are losing more files than they are dealing with, they are losing files by the hour.  It is another disastrous move.  Ordinary people, including cancer patients who are very sick, have had files go missing and they must telephone and wait, which causes great trauma.  Patients have always received medical cards when terminally ill.  The whole situation has become top-heavy with officials and there are not enough front line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I see from the figures the mental health budget is 5.3% of the total health budget.  That is a scandalously low priority.  I am not blaming this Government alone as I blame the last Government also.  I pay tribute to the services at St. Teresa's Hospital, Clogheen, as well as those at Carrick-on-Suir, St. Patrick's at Cashel and St. Anthony's at Clonmel.  I pay tribute to Sr. Áine at Clogheen and Ms Mary Prendergast at Cashel as well as to their excellent staffs.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">There were rumours St. Anthony's was to be closed and the next thing beds were gone from St. Patrick's and then services at Carrick-on-Suir had been cut.  An official came out from the health board to tell the management of a hospital of the finest quality at Clogheen that five beds must be cut because there was an overspend in Clonmel, in spite of the fact Clogheen was under budget.  I know the answer they got from Sr. Áine, rightly so.  Some of these officials need to get more answers of that kind because they are playing with people's lives.  They are playing on the fears and worries of elderly people who have served this country well and need a bit of comfort in their last days.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">These people should not have to be worried by the statement issued by the Minister and his people to the effect that so many nursing home beds are being taken out of the system.  We must be careful.  The last Deputy mentioned careless words and hysteria but these come mainly as leaks from the Department which is playing an old game, claiming it needs to make another report.  Another team will arrive in Clonmel, Wexford, or wherever, and there will be another report.  They are all reports about nothing.  Much ado about nothing is the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">However, crucial services are needed and must be allowed.  The attack now is on front-line services.  The name of Dr. Brook has been mentioned in this Chamber every day this week.  I do not believe that an eminent man in his position, who claims to be, or to have been, a member of the Minister of State's party, which is his own business, would make such serious statements without there being some credence to them.  If there were not, and he were to do something of that kind, he would not be in his job.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">What is happening in south Tipperary in respect of St. Michael's unit is a travesty.  In Wexford people have psychotic attacks, as they do in Tipperary and every place else, but the ambulances are now flat out on the road ferrying the patients to Waterford and there are none to pick up patients who are sick.  That is a fact.  We went to Wexford to see a situation and we saw it.  I thank the Minister for that opportunity.  However, it is only a fledgling situation, newly built and not proven.  We will not have the ambulances and gardaí will not have the time to bring people to hospital when they need to go.  This will not work.  We had solid commitments there would be no removal of services from St. Michael's until all aspects of community care were in place.  They are not yet there on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">This is a situation of confidence.  A budget which has only 5.3% dedicated to mental health is inadequate.  This plan will not happen.  We cannot trust - this is not personally meant for the Minister of State - the statements that come from the HSE through the Minister because, unfortunately, that organisation does not respect the Minister and his people.  Its members think they are bigger than Ministers and the elected Government.  That is the problem and has been the problem for a long time.  Unless it is tackled we are going nowhere.  These people must be put back in their boxes and made to earn the money they are paid.  They must provide value and quality for money and, above all, respect for the people.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_435">I am glad to contribute to this debate on the health plan for 2012.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Shortall and Lynch, well in the mammoth task they have been given, to reform a health service in the middle of the greatest economic recession this State has known.  The Minister is trying to reform a system - some would call it a monster - where there are thousands of good and dedicated people working in front line and management who, on many occasions, are just as frustrated with the service they deliver as are politicians and the public at large.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Deputy McGrath referred to the number of reports and the medical card situation.  All, or at least 99.9%, of the reports were produced by the Government of which he was part.  I agree with him on the medical card situation.  It is difficult because of the overwhelming number of applications from people who qualify for cards.  It was not a good idea to centralise the system but that decision was also taken by the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Minister, therefore, has inherited a system which was set up at a time when there was plenty.  When problems arose money was thrown at them without anybody examining what the problem really was.  Layers of bureaucracy were added that complicated delivery of service rather than reorganising and improving it.  In addition, in this year's plan the Minister must factor in the reduction of staff by some 3,700 at the end of this month.  According to some stories I hear, the difficulty is that in many cases the wrong people are retiring.  Perhaps I should say the people who are crucial to the ongoing delivery of the services are retiring.  This is why the 2012 plan will be particularly difficult and challenging but it is the most important plan that has ever been delivered by a health service in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">It is only natural that most of the time it is the problems and bad stories that make the headlines.  There are also many good stories and good things happening in the health service in recent weeks and months.  In my constituency, Mayo, our general hospital has come in closer to budget than most hospitals throughout the country have, even as it improves services.  For example, the number of patients on trolleys in 2006, at the height of the Celtic tiger era, was 2,285.  The number on trolleys in 2011 was 599.  That is still too many but it is a 400% improvement on what it was.  This has come about because of greater flexibility, better use of resources, better organisation and changes in work practices.  I compliment the chief executive officer in Mayo General Hospital, Mr. Frank Murphy, and the hospital manager, Mr. Charlie Meehan, who have improved services in many areas.  An example is renal dialysis where all patients in County Mayo will get their treatment in the Mayo General Hospital rather than having to travel to Galway.  A new MRI scanner has been added, with the help of massive local fund-raising.  It is crucial, however, that good and efficient management is rewarded rather than punished.  In other words, the line should not be taken that since such great savings were made last year the same can be done again next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">For the overall delivery of an efficient health service the role of the district hospital is crucial.  In County Mayo we have three: Swinford, where a magnificent new extension was officially opened in July by the Taoiseach; St. Joseph's Hospital, Ballina; and Belmullet District Hospital.  In order to allow the acute hospitals to run efficiently it is vital that beds are maintained at the district hospitals so that patients can be transferred or stepped down from the acute hospital, in our case Mayo General Hospital.  I compliment the Minister for the allocation of a special fund to allow front-line critical services to continue in a safe manner.  This is happening in Swinford where there had been a threat to 12 beds.  This has now been removed.  It is crucial that the same should happen in St. Joseph's in Ballina which has similar difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I turn to the Minister's proposals to organise every acute hospital into a set of hospital groups so they can be managed efficiently and as co-ordinated units.  The Minister stated that for far too long some hospitals have tended to work in isolation, not working with others or taking a team approach.  Mayo General Hospital has always had a close relationship with University College Hospital Galway and it is critical that this relationship is allowed to continue in the new groupings.  Ideally, any hospital network should provide a full range of services up to three-quarter level, with the exception of the super-regional or national specialties.  Mayo General Hospital has been fortunate to have been part of such a network with UCHG as the regional centre.  An increasing level of its services are provided on a outreach basis in Castlebar.  Systems have been developed around that relationship, for example, in ICT and laboratory work.  There are established and developing clinical relationships, most recently in the case of breast cancer services.  It would be difficult and costly to dismantle such arrangements and provide equally good substitutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The linkage of Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals would be a combination of relatively equal-sized hospitals, with roughly similar numbers of beds in general specialties.  It is not clear that a network or regional arrangement has actually worked in that north-western region as the experience appears to be that where additional specialties were provided at Sligo General Hospital the tendency has been to seek to have similar services in Letterkenny.  It is also unclear whether patients from mid to north Donegal have seen Sligo General as their hospital of choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The organisation of hospital services should take account of geographical relationships and the natural flow of populations.  Apart from the border areas, County Mayo people travel to Galway as a regional centre when a service is not available locally.  It is also interesting to note that regional bodies in tourism and other such areas tend to link counties Mayo and Galway.  It is unclear why it would be in the interests of the Galway-based regional hospital services to lose County Mayo from its immediate catchment area.  The presence of the university and related medical academy in Galway is also a strong reason why Mayo General Hospital should work closely with UCHG.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">There are many other points I would like to address but I do not have the time to do so.  I refer, for example, to the €35 million which has been allocated to mental health services.  This is most welcome because more than any other service it has suffered the most in funding in recent years.  I urge the proposed directorate for mental health services is appointed immediately to ensure the €35 million funding can be rolled out where it is most needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The difficulties with medical card applications was raised by other Deputies and it is one which I have raised many times too.  I accept these are largely due to overwhelming demand and commend the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, for her efforts in recent weeks to streamline the application process.  Bottlenecks in systems such as those at the Passport Office previously were replicated in the medical card unit.  It is important these are sorted out.  People go through enough trauma with a medical condition without having to send their medical information to the unit three times in respect of an application.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The most fundamental job of the Department of Health is the reform of the health services.  From the greatest challenges come the greatest opportunities.  With people working together, a good health service can be delivered.  This year will be crucial to that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate which is important for the health services, its reform and funding.  When Mary Harney was Minister, I suggested when I was on the Government side of the House that we should put the broad thrust of reform of the health services beyond politics — not political debate — to allow the Minister to get as much traction as she or he needed to bring about the large reforms required then.  Even on this side of the House now, I still suggest that is the sensible way to approach health service reform.  One cannot expect Ministers to firefight the system every single day and complicate their job while expecting them to get the best value for money and reform.  All Members should strive to ensure some leeway in how we deal with the health services to allow Ministers the scope to follow a particular line of reform or policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Those on the other side of the House can blame us for creating the Health Service Executive, which we accept.  It was, however, never completed, is poor in its administration and information on health services must be extracted and dragged kicking and screaming from it.  The manner in which it responds to parliamentary questions gives a clear indication of its total disregard and disrespect for politicians and our job of representing people.  Responses can take up to months.  When one eventually gets one, it is usually out of date and inaccurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Will the Minister of State insist HSE replies to parliamentary questions are answered correctly, comprehensively, accurately and in a timely fashion?  Otherwise, Members representing the public cannot complete their parliamentary duties as we would like.  Such a move would be a fundamental shift in focusing on the importance of this Parliament versus what is happening in the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The HSE's governance and control of human resources in administration leaves much to be desired.  Until recently it was claimed over 2,000 HSE managers were not even sure of their own job descriptions.  I understand from the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that some of these managers have retired or been given a different job.  Why was the administrative system, which costs so much to run, allowed to carry staff that were surplus to requirement when cuts mean those barely over the medical card limits do not qualify for them or others cannot get into hospital?  Why was this allowed to drag on for over ten years?</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_451">That does not mean a Government cannot and should not take a deliberate decision on it.  It is about good governance and respect for taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">If one wants an example of a total collapse of how a system is administered, one only need look at how the medical card system is administered at national level.  Deputy O'Mahony claimed the last Government was responsible for this.  This and the last Government should not be directly blamed for the administrative errors that occur in the medical card system.  It lies with those who administer it.  It should be part of the standard of good practice that one would apply in any system, yet the HSE has failed in ensuring those who need medical cards get them in a timely fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">We can all give examples of the difficulties experienced.  I know of one applicant who was approved for a medical card last week which was followed days later with a GP card.  Both of them are in date but the individual does not know to which one he is entitled.  I know of other cases where medical card applications have been lost or the applicant has been asked to apply on three different occasions for the same card.  It is not correct that such a system should be allowed continue.  The administrative errors in the system need to be corrected and the Minister must ensure some humanity and compassion in its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">It is unfortunate that whistleblowers who speak out to ensure improvements in the system for service users often if not always become the victims themselves, broken and out of a job.  Recently in the House, I raised the matter of an incident in Kilkenny with the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, in which a psychiatric patient was locked out of a facility and was forced to sleep out in the rain.  The nurse who complained about this treatment now no longer works in the facility.  The first investigation into the incident was in-house and all subsequent investigations continued to uphold its findings.  Instead, someone from outside the HSE should have investigated the incident to ensure it never happens again and that the whistleblower's rights were protected and he or she did not suffer any consequences for his or her actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Senior nurses have come forward to tell me their fears that the psychiatric and community services in which they work are going to collapse and will not be able to continue beyond a particular time and date.  They have made their views known within the service and have asked for the necessary changes to be made in the interest of patients.  Those changes have not been implemented, however, and one of the nurses in question is now on sick leave.  That is a terrible indictment of the organisation.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to respond to those who want to improve the services for the sake of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I ask that a review be carried out of expenditure on home help packages.  By supporting people in their own homes, we can prevent them from occupying hospital beds that might be put to other uses.  That is worth doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">We must review Graignamanagh in County Kilkenny in terms of providing a primary care unit for an urban centre with a large population and rural hinterland.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Anyone who looks for services in Graiguecullen in County Laois, which borders County Carlow, is told to go to a different county.  I have repeatedly urged the local administrators to put in place a package to facilitate those who need services at that location.  They should not be penalised just because they fall between two stools.  I appeal to the Minister of State to work with the local HSE office or general administration to ensure services are improved and extended in that area, as in most other parts of counties Carlow and Kilkenny.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonnMaloney" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</from>
          <p eId="para_459">I concur with other speakers on the need for a broad review of medical services in Ireland.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and her colleagues and wish them well in bringing about at least some of the changes outlined in this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The health service is more often than not the subject of criticism by the media and others.  In defence of the vast majority of hard working public servants in the health sector, they should be complimented for the work they do in often difficult circumstances.  Those who work in the health service will seldom receive a compliment from our newspapers but this Parliament should praise rather than criticise them.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">As regards reform, other speakers have referred to the umpteen reports that have been produced on health in Ireland.  We are good at producing reports but we are not as good at reform.  There are individuals in the health sector who are as conservative as some politicians and who do not want change but politicians also have to take some blame for the lack of reform.  Every politician who spoke about this review expressed support for reform provided it is not in his or her constituency.  That has also been the experience historically and there has been very little reform of the Irish health system for that reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I remind those who speak about funding hospitals that a former Taoiseach told us in 1986 that we were the richest country in the world.  Of course, we went out and celebrated that night, or all two of us.  It is nonsense to argue that money is the solution to the problems in the health service.  As a Labour Party Deputy, it is difficult to defend a former Progressive Democrats Minister for Health and Children but, for all that was said about Mary Harney, she certainly put money into the health system.  It did not work, however, as this review proves.  We cannot blame her for that because people stood in the way of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I am fortunate to represent a constituency which has Tallaght hospital, the busiest hospital in the country, on its doorstep.  Tallaght hospital has a dedicated staff but it received the lowest level of funding during the heyday of the Celtic tiger.  We could be here all night debating that issue but I am only stating a fact.  Further towards Brittas, a very good and long-standing service is provided at St. Brigid's nursing home in Crooksling.  However, even though the nursing home recently received a glowing report from HIQA, the HSE is proceeding with a review of its future.  I am in favour of keeping the facility in place and I hope the Minister of State takes note of my views.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_464">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the important issue of health services, which affect every family in this country.  Our current circumstances encourage us to focus on reality.  I commend the Minister for Health and his colleagues on identifying the need for reform in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I am long enough in this House to remember when we were members of health boards.  As part of visiting committees, our visits to institutions gave us the great advantage of becoming familiar with health services on the ground.  This familiarity disappeared when the health boards were abolished and replaced with a free standing self-supporting system that was supposed to be the Rolls Royce of health service provision.  As an Opposition Deputy I opposed the transformation on the basis that it would become an unaccountable entity with its own policy making department and no regard for supervision.  It was claimed at the time that political supervision was bad and that politics had to be taken out of the health service.  I am afraid that did not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The review now taking place has to identify the issues and, more importantly, introduce a system that is accountable to national Parliament, budget providers and the people who vote for the Department's budget.  To endorse a system whereby the national Exchequer funds a devolved department is without question wrong - it can only lose.  We, the people elected by the public, are the ones who will pay for it because none of these people will so do.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I emphasise the points made by Deputy Maloney about St. Brigid's nursing home in Crooksling, which is on the border of my constituency and his.  The existing services provided to the very deserving patients in that women-only nursing home are second to none.  The facility is state of the art and over the years it has been proven that institution is well capable of delivering the highest quality of service for the people for whom it was intended.  Some, in the course of revisionism, will say we need to find new ways.  We used to hear insulting remarks about bed-blockers.  It was appalling to suggest that a patient was blocking a bed from somebody who was more deserving.  All the people who require in-hospital health services or other institutional care are entitled to them.  We have an obligation to ensure that the people, who worked all their lives in this country and who may need recuperative, supportive or ongoing full-time nursing care, get those services.  I am sorry to say that over the years that has become very vague.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Some things in the HSE's pipeline have been proposed without having full regard for the extent of the requirement in terms of primary care or institutional care.  It is wrong to suggest that primary care is less expensive than institutional care in all cases because it takes three times the staffing levels in community care if the patient requires continuous 24-hour nursing care.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The five minutes both of us had were simply not sufficient to cover the health services in any kind of detail and I hope we will have another opportunity to do so in the not too distant future.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
          <p eId="para_470">I thank all the Members who contributed to this useful debate, with many important issues raised.  We all share an interest and concern in the health service, which is one of the most fundamental services in terms of the impact on our constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The Government is committed to introducing a better and more efficient health system, which will have improved services for the people of this country.  With this in mind, we are committed to introducing a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income, albeit at a time when extremely challenging economic and fiscal conditions prevail.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has already outlined to the House the financial challenge facing the health sector and the difficulties anticipated owing to impending staff retirements.  He has also described the various actions and reforms being taken across the broader health system to mitigate the effects of budget and staff reductions on front-line services and to ensure that there will not be a straight-line reduction in services.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I wish to outline for the House the detailed reforms proposed within the primary care area.  As recently announced by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, new administrative structures will be put in place within the HSE to reflect the need for greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency in funding, service delivery and accountability.  These are essential if we are to provide a responsive health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">This will involve appointing a number of directors at national level, one of whom will have responsibility for primary care.  We are all agreed that 90% to 95% of a person's health needs should be catered for in primary care and yet it is the poor relation of the health service and incredibly there is no national director with his of his own budget for primary care.  The director of primary care, who will be appointed shortly, will be tasked with establishing clearer service delivery structures and clear funding arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It is important at any time, but particularly in these challenging times, that money is spent wisely and services are delivered in the most cost effective way.  The HSE's national service plan for 2012 includes a challenging cost saving target of €124 million in the area of drug costs.  Legislation will be introduced this year to provide for a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for drugs prescribed under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  These measures will reduce costs for both the HSE and patients.  Discussions with pharmaceutical manufacturers are also under way to ensure these savings will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">It is clear that reform is needed and the development of primary care services is an essential component of the health service reform process.  In a developed primary care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting, which is what we want to do.  Primary care teams are being developed.  Even though we are talking about a 2001 primary care strategy, progress on delivering that strategy during times of plenty in this country was pathetically slow and we are paying a serious price for that now.  If we can make progress at this late stage in developing the primary care teams, they will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, public health nurses and all other critical health-care personnel required to provide that multidisciplinary care.  Additional services such as speech and language therapy should also be provided on a sessional basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Each primary care team will serve a defined population.  There are currently 425 primary care teams in place, but they are not all fully developed yet.  It is regrettable that progress on this matter in the past decade has been so terribly slow.  The HSE's service plan commits to having 489 operational teams in place by the end of this year and I, as Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, will be in constant discussion with the HSE to ensure we have fully operational teams by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Each primary care team will be supported by a wider range of professionals, including pharmacists, dieticians, psychologists and chiropodists, who will form a health and social care network.  Each network will support approximately three to six primary care teams.  The vast majority of specialist-based services will be organised at this level, including mental health community teams, child protection etc.  Primary care teams will also create an environment which enables structured approaches to chronic disease management, enhanced multidisciplinary team working, improved diagnostic capabilities in primary care, and the integration of services between primary and secondary care.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The service plan states the HSE intends to commence a national roll-out of chronic disease management for diabetes during 2012.  I am very glad that €2 million has been provided in the current service plan for this very important new development in our health service.  The HSE will also progress preparations for the roll-out of similar initiatives for other chronic diseases, including stroke, asthma and heart failure.  The delivery of these chronic disease management programmes at community level is key to moving to a new, much more responsive and cost effective model of care in the health service.  The provision of integrated services whereby the patient has access to an extensive range of services in their own community, ideally all in the same building, is undoubtedly the way forward and this will help to reduce considerably the reliance on hospital-based services.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The service plan also demonstrates the continued success of the general practitioner out-of-hours service.  In addition, a key commitment in the programme for Government and a fundamental element in the health reform process involves significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis.  As it stands, the system cannot deal with the demands that will come in future.  Therefore, we must gear up on a phased basis to ensure we have the additional GPs, nurses and other professionals to provide universal access to free GP care.  The introduction of this programme will begin this year with the first phase in which all those currently claiming under the long-term illness scheme will come under the free GP care initiative.  Legislation is being developed in this regard at the moment and we hope to have it in place by mid-year.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Funding of €20 million has been provided to fill as many vacancies as possible arising from retirements in the HSE within the primary care area.  There is no doubt these retirements will pose significant challenges for us in terms of continuing to provide an acceptable level of care.  However, within the primary care area a figure of €20 million is ring-fenced to back-fill as many of these places as possible.  Naturally, we will be unable to fill all these vacancies but we will fill as many as possible and we will concentrate the resources on front-line resources.  There is also the prospect of an additional €5 million being available if we can make additional savings in the drugs area.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Department has also commissioned a study to examine the question of workforce planning in primary care in order that we can be assured that there will be a sufficient number of GPs and practice nurses to cater for the demand that will arise as we roll out free GP care.  The provision of GP care without fees during this Government's term of office is an absolute priority for me.  The implementation of this commitment will be delivered upon beginning this year.  We hope to continue this development during the coming four years in order that we get to a point where the whole population will be covered by the initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The strengthening of primary care planned in the programme for Government reflects the need to move to new models of care throughout all service areas that will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity in their community and provide quality services at the least possible cost.  This approach makes sense from the patient's point of view, from a health point of view and from a cost point of view.  We are determined to deliver on this as soon as possible and work is well underway on these commitments as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I refer to the issue of medical cards and the difficulties that have arisen in recent times.  I realise this is a matter of concern to many Members.  There is no question but that the level of service provided to patients has been unacceptable.  There are several reasons why this has been the case and the issue has come to a head in recent months.  There was a changeover from the system of community welfare officers, CWOs, processing medical card renewals and applications.  A considerable backlog was passed over to the HSE primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, to deal with, to the point where at one stage those involved were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers involved.  There was also an issue in terms of their gearing up for the centralisation.  I took the view that they undertook this too quickly and I expressed that view at the time.  In addition, there were difficulties with the processing systems.  I was not satisfied with the type of service being provided or the systems in place in the PCRS in Finglas.  Progress has been made in recent weeks and I intend to circulate all Members with the details.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">From this month we will have moved to a situation whereby there will be self-assessment for the renewal of medical cards and this will assist the process greatly.  This will be matched by a spot-checking system to ensure there is proper accountability.  I assure Members that anyone whose medical card has come up for renewal and who has engaged with the HSE in a meaningful way will not lose an entitlement until a final decision is made on that entitlement.  Members can put at rest constituents' minds in this regard.  The backlog is being worked through the system and we are moving towards the new self-assessment system.  I hope to see significant improvements in the coming weeks in this regard and I will inform Members of the details of the new system without delay.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
            <p eId="para_488">I raise this important issue on behalf of the many parents who are concerned at the reduction in the provision of respite care.  I refer specifically to the provision of respite care for young people suffering from autism and Asperger's syndrome.  Many young people on the autism spectrum feel emotionally isolated in their own world.  Often they cannot or are reluctant to go outside and mix with other children.  The lack of early intervention and the long wait for appointments and treatment puts immense pressure on the parents and families of these children.  The responsibility of care rests almost entirely on their shoulders and, sadly, many feel ignored and abandoned by the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">Parents face significant challenges while they care for an autistic child.  Many say they would be lost without the support of friends and family.  They also say that the support of outside groups is invaluable at times when they simply need a break.  This is where respite is so important; it gives them time-out and serves as an important coping mechanism for them and their partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">In many of these families, one parent gives up work to care 24 hours, seven days per week for a child with autism.  They see respite as a valuable period of several hours or an overnight period during which time they can entrust their child to a dedicated service and do simple things for themselves that would be impossible otherwise.  Respite provides a safe haven for young people with autism to meet their peers and engage in social activities.  The nurses and staff who work in respite services are fantastic people with a specific understanding of their conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">However, in recent months provision of respite in our communities has been reduced.  This is due to reduced staffing levels which have come about as a result of staff going on leave.  In addition, the moratorium on staffing in the HSE is having a detrimental effect on respite hours.  Services are stretched and simply cannot cope with the demand for respite.  Many families are struggling and parents are devastated that their lifeline is being taken away.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">Under the HSE plan for 2012 provision has been made for investment of €1 million for autism services.  This will be used to address waiting times for specialised treatment for children who have been diagnosed with autism and to develop early intervention teams.  I welcome this commitment but we need to address urgently the problem of inadequate provision of respite for families of young children and young adults with autism.  Young Irish people with autism have specific needs but we in Ireland are only slowly waking up to the seriousness of autism and how best to treat and care for children and young adults with autism.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_493">I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this matter.  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive, HSE, is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including disability services.  The HSE's service plan for 2012 states that the allocation for disability services will reduce by 3.7% as a consequence of the impact of the efficiency, procurement and targeted pay reduction savings.  However, the aim of the HSE will be to tailor such reductions in a way which minimises the impact on service users and their families, as much as possible.  The Government is very much aware of the importance of respite service provision for the families of both children and adults with disabilities including those with autism.  Disability service providers have been requested by the HSE to advise and discuss with it the challenges they are experiencing, prior to any reductions or changes to service provision being implemented.  While there may be some changes to front line services, in many cases these changes will not necessarily result in service reduction, but in a different model of service delivery being applied. For example, respite provision is not always centre based and can be provided in a number of ways, such as, out of home, in home, home to home, home support or family support.  Assessments are completed locally to determine and prioritise needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">In 2010, a working group was established by the HSE to carry out a national overview of models of respite and residential care with host families in community settings and to determine the viability of these models of service delivery for future development for people with an intellectual disability.  The report of the working group will be published shortly and one of its recommendations will be that each HSE area review and reconfigure respite and residential service provision to include the host family support model of service provision as an element of the overall respite or residential package available.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years through the moratorium on recruitment of public servants and retirements represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The reduction in staffing increases the need for reform.  The HSE national service plan includes a commitment to addressing these issues within the context of the Croke Park agreement.  It also commits the HSE to minimising the impact on services by fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources, including greater flexibilities in. work practices and rosters.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">Service provision continues to be a challenge for all of us in the current environment.  However, the HSE is currently involved in detailed discussions and collaborative working under the auspices of the National Consultative Forum, which includes umbrella groups such as the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  Through these discussions, the HSE is developing an innovative approach to service provision to maximise how resources are used to protect front line services.  There has been a continued expansion in the availability of respite support services and these services have grown significantly in recent years.  More than 4,600 people availed of respite services funded by the HSE in 2011.  This service has supported people to continue living with their families and in their communities.  The Government is very much aware of the importance of respite service provision for the families of both children and adults with disabilities and will seek to ensure that front line services are protected as far as possible within the current difficult circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  These young people are not faceless and nameless but are people who live in all our communities where they are known by name by neighbours and friends.  Their journey through life is difficult enough, without adding further stress or confusion.  I welcome what the Minister of State has said with regard to trying to keep provisions in place.  The country is in a dark place and we all understand the need for cost effectiveness and value for money.  However, we should not extinguish the glimmer of light for these families.  The Minister of State may already have given a partial answer to my questions, but can she give a commitment to these families that the services they currently access will be maintained and that when staffing problems occur, provision will be made to ensure these children retain the respite care hours they already have?  These people are not looking for anything extra, only to maintain what they have.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">Every sector of the health services wants assurances that things will not change, but we have no choice but to try and change the way we deliver services, because budgets are being cut.  This is a reality with which we must all live and we must work within those constraints.  This means we must try to get better value for money from the services we provide and closely examine how we spend money to ensure that we achieve savings where there is a potential for making them.  We must also ensure we keep the focus on the front line services and end users or clients.  It is about the clients, not about the organisations, salaries for management or so on.  The focus must be on the end user.  The challenge for all of us is to maintain the level and quality of services we have as far as possible, but to do that in a flexible way because of the reduced budgets.</p>

          <heading>Child Abuse</heading>
          <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_186">
            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
            <p eId="para_499">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting this important issue.  I welcome the publication of the Garda Inspectorate's report Responding to Child Sexual Abuse, a report which was provided to the Government at the end of 2010.  This report was initiated by the previous Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and it was important it was done, as is highlighted by the serious issues which have come to light since publication of the report yesterday.  The report shows that all has not been done well in terms of how agencies of State have dealt with child sexual abuse and with the reporting and handling of these cases over the years.  We are well aware of this from the inquiries that have been held over recent years into the church and into how gardaí and the HSE handled the reporting of those crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">The Garda Inspectorate's report raises particular concerns.  For example it showed delays in recording of reports of child sexual offences, which then resulted in intelligence gaps.  It showed a failure to make timely entries in the PULSE system, exposing children to continuing risk.  Basic record keeping was poor and as a result the official crime records did not capture up to 65% of sex crimes.  The report also showed that in almost one-third of cases, details of investigations had been entered into the PULSE computer database, but had not been classified as criminal offences and were, therefore, missing from the overall crime figures.  More worrying is the fact the report showed there were turf wars between the Garda and the HSE in terms of how reports were dealt with.  It showed inadequate co-operation between the Garda and the HSE in the investigation of child sex abuse to ensure that investigations were done promptly.  In a sample of cases in Dublin, the report showed that plans as to how complaints would be investigated between the Garda and the HSE  had only been developed and put together in 1% of cases.  This is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">I want the Minister of State to outline here what has happened with regard to the recommendations made in the Garda Inspectorate's report since it was left on the Minister's desk well over a year ago.  Many of the recommendations are straightforward and urgent.  They need to be implemented in order to ensure that some of the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  Will the Minister of State outline what has happened in terms of implementing those recommendations?  Although the report was only published yesterday, the Government has had it for a long time.  I would expect significant progress to have been made in that time in terms of dealing with many of the recommendations and problems highlighted in the report.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_187" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_502">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is attending a North-South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh today.  She regrets that she cannot be here.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">I note that this debate stems from a report in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> on the Garda Inspectorate report on responding to child sexual abuse<i>, </i>which refers to a turf war between the HSE and An Garda Síochána on the issue of child sexual abuse cases.  I wish to make it clear to the House at the outset that is no such turf war between the HSE and the Garda Síochána on this issue, nor is this contention contained in the report itself.  The issue of child protection is one that the HSE and the Garda Síochána are totally committed to addressing in a co-operative manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">I wish to place this issue in its proper context by quoting directly from the Garda Inspectorate report, Responding to Child Sexual Abuse.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_505">The International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) recognises that turf issues will inevitably arise when work begins on a multi-disciplinary response to child abuse.  Turf issues are the result of each agency or professional group's identification of its own mandate, and the concerns that somehow the co-operation that is being sought will negatively affect this mandate. ... The important dynamic with turf issues is to recognise and confront them as they occur. Understanding why these issues have come to the forefront is key.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">This statement clearly seeks to comment on so-called turf issues in the general sense and is not a statement aimed particularly at either the HSE or the Garda authorities.  In addition the Garda Inspectorate report states, "There is no doubting the declared commitments of the (then) OMCYA, the Garda Síochána and the HSE to the protection of children from abuse".</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The Garda Inspectorate report was prepared on foot of a direction from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, following the publication of the commission of investigation's report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin in July 2009<i>, </i>issued on 26 November 2009.  The report was published yesterday by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The purpose of the report was to conduct a comprehensive review of police practices for handling these very sensitive and important cases.  In preparing the report, the inspectorate conducted a review of published reports relating to clerical sexual abuse but also considered the full spectrum of child sexual abuses perpetrated by a wide variety of offenders.  The inspectorate states that only a holistic, collaborative approach by all statutory and voluntary agencies will make the difference that is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">The Minister welcomes the report of the Garda Inspectorate and the response document.  In particular she welcomes the emphasis throughout on the need for more effective inter-agency working in the area of child protection.  This is an area which she considers critical as we progress a range of reforms necessary to strengthen the child welfare and protection system generally.  In this regard, the Minister has published revised Children First guidance, the implementation of which is being overseen by an interdepartmental group including representatives of various Departments, the HSE and An Garda Síochána.  There has also been good progress made in advancing preparatory work on the establishment of the new children and family support agency and on the preparation of legislation to underpin Children First.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">The HSE has welcomed the report and noted the considerable progress which has been made since its preparation with regard to the development of child abuse services and in developing close liaison between the HSE and An Garda Síochána in a number of areas.  The HSE children and family services are engaged in a major programme of reform.  A major element of the change agenda in 2012 involves implementing consistent child protection procedures in line with the revised national guidelines which were published last year, namely, Children First 2011<i>. </i> As part of the drive to improve the response to child abuse, the HSE developed the child protection and welfare handbook, National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which is a reference text for practitioners.  This handbook was launched by the Minister with the HSE and An Garda Síochána.  In addition, a programme of joint training involving HSE staff and members of An Garda Síochána on the implementation of Children First has been progressing since last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">Let me reiterate that there is no turf war between the HSE and An Garda Síochána on this issue.  Instead, we are now seeing real progress in implementing inter-agency working in the child protection area, something which was lacking for far too long.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_188">
            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
            <p eId="para_511">The report shows the importance of putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  I urge the Minister of State and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that this work is done as quickly as possible.  It highlights how our State agencies, which are responsible for protecting children and for ensuring that safeguards are in place so that abuse can be prevented and dealt with, were not working well together in the past and have not been following the Children First guidelines to the full in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">Putting these guidelines on a statutory basis is critical but we cannot just legislate our way out of this and legislate our way towards better child protection practices.  We also have to ensure that the resources are put in place.  At a time when the Government is cutting the resources of the Garda and at a time when there are additional pressures on our social work system, we need to ensure that the resources and trained personnel are there so that the situations highlighted by the inspectorate's report are dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">I am also disappointed that the publication of this report has not been accompanied by an update from the Government on the 19 recommendations contained within it.  The Government has had this report for over 14 months.  I would have thought that an item by item update on the 19 recommendations that are part of it would have been an appropriate response.  I ask the Minister of State to give more detail on that and to its importance upon the Minister.  What does she intend to do to ensure they are being implemented as quickly as possible?</p>

          <heading>Back to Education Allowance</heading>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_190">
            <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy</from>
            <p eId="para_516">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">My concerns centre on the difficulties being experienced by graduates of business courses who are applying to study professional diplomas in education but who cannot receive the back to education allowance.  This is due to a higher points threshold imposed upon them by the Postgraduate Applications Centre since 2006.  This was introduced due to the high demand of business graduates for places on PDEs.  The requirement effectively demands that business students have a master's qualification in order to reach the required number of points to qualify for the postgraduate diploma in education.  However, this has implications for one's eligibility for the back to education allowance as the same students are ultimately seeking to study for postgraduate diploma in education, which is a lesser qualification than a master's degree.  This goes against the principle of progression and therefore renders the students ineligible for their payment.  It defeats the purpose intended by the Government, as many prospective PDE students, once they realise they cannot receive the back to education allowance, are deciding not to pursue the course, as it is financially unviable for them to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">This is fundamentally wrong.  We are meant to be encouraging people to return to education with a view to upskilling, acquiring further training and gaining employment in future.  To cite an example, with business graduates this year required to have 53 points to qualify for the postgraduate diploma in education, it is impossible for such graduates to secure a place without a masters degree because 45 points is the maximum awarded for a first class honours primary degree.  Therefore, even when one factors in the five points awarded for work experience, business graduates still fall short of the 53 points required.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">I fully understand that the progression principle is in place to ensure displacement does not occur and I accept that courses should not be offered to students who are not progressing at a cost to students progressing from a lower level.  However, business students are being disproportionately affected by the progression rule.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to review the position to ensure business students are not penalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">I draw attention to two significant and noteworthy points.  First, the Government, through the Teaching Council, insists that everyone who pursues a teaching career must have a postgraduate diploma in education, PDE.  In other words, the only way to secure employment in teaching is through the PDE process.  Second, this requirement is affecting a larger cohort of students than ever because of the massive swell in the number of unemployed people seeking to return to education.  As I outlined, it is Government policy to return people to the classroom to upskill and engage in further training.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">A further difficulty is the absence of clarity at departmental level as to which Department is responsible for rectifying this administrative difficulty.  I have pursued this issue in recent months with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  The former is responsible for the postgraduate applications centre which made the decision in 2006 to impose a higher points threshold on business graduates.  As I noted, this decision was taken in response to the large number of applicants for the course.  The Department of Social Protection, on the other hand, is responsible for the back to education allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">The Department has pointed out in its statement of conditions applying that the scheme is not statutorily based and decisions on eligibility are made at its discretion.  This means there is scope to accommodate business students who find themselves trapped in this administrative quagmire and who are ultimately discouraged from returning to the classroom.  The scheme, as administered, is flawed as it disproportionately affects business graduates and acts as a disincentive to education when we should be making every reasonable effort to get people back into education and training.</p>

The back to education allowance, BTEA, scheme is a second chance education opportunity scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher education than that already held.  The number of participants engaged with the BTEA has grown steadily in recent years.  As of 31 December 2011, provisional figures indicate in the region of 25,700 participants are engaged with the scheme in the 2011-12 academic year, which is an increase on the previous year.  In the 2010-11 academic year, the scheme attracted 25,032 participants, an increase of 20% on the previous year when there were 20,808 participants.  The 2009-10 academic year, which was when the recession began to bite, saw a dramatic increase in participation of 79% on the previous year.  Provisional expenditure on the back to education allowance scheme in 2011 was €200 million.  An estimate of €183 million has been provided for the scheme in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">A person wishing to pursue the back to education allowance scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions, such as being of a certain age, receiving a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified period, pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications, among other matters.  The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines.  The back to education allowance is available to eligible persons in pursuit of a professional diploma in education, which was previously known as the graduate diploma in education or higher diploma, in any discipline - level 8 in the national framework of qualifications.  Other postgraduate qualifications - levels 9 and 10 - are not included.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">BTEA guidelines are in the main in line with the mechanisms in place for student support type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher qualification level.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  It should be noted that of the 25,032 participants supported through BTEA in the 2010-11 academic year, 43% pursued second level courses.  It is sometimes overlooked that many of those returning to education are completing second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_526">My officials inform me, following discussion with officials from the Department of Education and Skills, that the Postgraduate Applications Centre Limited was established in 1998 to centrally process and assess applications to postgraduate diploma in education courses.  A common points system was devised and it has been used since.  Applicants apply to the Postgraduate Applications Centre online and their applications are centrally assessed by a team of assessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">In 2006, a decision was taken, owing to the large numbers of applicants with business related degrees, to impose a cap on business type degrees.  To this end, a 10% allocation was introduced.  This decision was taken to ensure an adequate supply of post-primary teachers for all subject areas and avoid an oversupply of teachers of business subjects.  Since the demand for places from graduates with business related degrees is high and the number of places available capped, the point scores tend to be higher than for other degrees.  I am not in a position to comment on entry requirements or thresholds associated with this specific course or any other course as the matter is not within my remit.  The issue of points is one for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I do not know if Deputy McCarthy has been around the Houses with the Minister on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_528">I thank the Minister and respectfully note that her reply sums up the difficulty I have outlined.  The reply includes five paragraphs dealing with the back to education allowance.  I am familiar with the detail of the scheme and the eligibility criteria for the allowance.  However, the response does not address the administrative quagmire I described.  The final paragraph, in which the Minister refers me to the Minister for Education and Skills, sums up the difficulty I face.  I have been over and back between the two Departments for several weeks.  The difficulty I highlighted is that if applicants are to achieve the required points, they must have a masters degree while those with a masters degree are not eligible for the back to education allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_529">I will not forward a copy of the Minister's reply to the person who asked me to raise this matter because it is a bureaucratic response that describes the current system but fails to address the administrative quagmire I have described.  I have been in touch with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection on this matter.  The specific case I raise is a typical example of an issue that falls between two stools.  The conditions attached to a scheme in one Department have resulted in an individual failing to meet the criteria set by another Department.  What is required is a ministerial decision.  As the criteria are not statutorily based, there is room for discretion.  I will pursue this matter further because the response does not address the anomaly I have raised and runs counter to the spirit of Government policy, that is, to get people back into the classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_530">I want to see movement on this issue because the case I raise is not an isolated one.  There are bound to be others who are being prevented from availing of reasonable entitlements as a result of bureaucratic anomalies arising from two Departments having a role in one broad area.</p>

            <p eId="para_531">I appreciate the dilemma and the almost catch-22 in regard to the points qualification and the anomaly Deputy McCarthy raised.  He will appreciate that the role of the Department of Social Protection, in supporting students on the back to education allowance, is income support.  We do not get involved in the technical educational qualification side of it because that is not our competence but rather that of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Deputy referenced the Teaching Council also.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">I accept there is a problem here and I would be happy to pursue it with the Minister for Education and Skills.  I would like to make another suggestion.  There is now an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education, although I do not know if the Deputy is a member of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_534">Perhaps that committee could look at this.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">There are 25,700 participants on back to education.  Some 43% of them are in second level while the majority are in third level.  The cost is very high.  We spent €200 million last year and we will spend €183 million this year.  As the Deputy identified, it is money well spent if people move on to employment but we have a limited budget.  It would be dishonest of me if I did not say that we are in a very tight budgetary situation.  I will certainly ask my officials to raise this with the Department of Education and Skills but I think the Deputy hinted at part of the solution himself, that is, to reference the Teaching Council and how it came up with the specific points requirement it has which, in a way, constitutes the difficulty.  As I suggested, perhaps the joint committee might offer some scope to bring the different parties together.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_196">
            <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_536">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This issue came to our attention on Monday when a number of people called to our office to say the doors of Rents &amp; Co., a bill payment company, were closed on Monday morning.  There was a certain anxiety among people in regard to the money they had given the company to pay their bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_537">Subsequently, customers received a letter dated 31 January from the company advising that the bill payment system was closed, that the Central Bank had frozen its account, that it was no longer able to provide for further collection or deposits, that it would notify customers' creditors on their behalf and that it was currently updating its computer system.  What it did not say was whether customers' money would be refunded in full.  That is a huge concern for people.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">This is a very unfortunate victim of the recession.  Many people in the area depended on the company to pay their bills, as they are cut to the bone in terms of paying mortgages, utility bills, insurance and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">This is a limited company but we do not know if it is in receivership or insolvent.  It seems the money has been frozen under the new Central Bank regulations.  I was under the impression that only institutions, such as credit unions and banks, which lend money were covered by the new regulations.  This company does not lend and does not appear to have invested in property using money on deposit.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">In whatever way this company is dealt with, we must ensure people are paid first.  A young lad with a young family put €7,000 in just before Christmas to pay the mortgage, insurance and many other bills which were coming up.  Already a number of people have had their UPC connection cut off because the cheques bounced.  The company wrote them in good faith but the money was then frozen.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">It appears that such companies are not bonded.  We should look at limited companies and at what people are signing up to, in particular companies looking for money up-front, for example, the private for profit waste companies asking people to pay up-front.  These companies should be bonded to secure that money if they go into liquidation or close.  This seems to be happening much more.  I would like to hear the Minister's ideas on that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_197">
            <from>Minister for Finance  (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_542">I thank Deputy Collins for raising this important issue.  As I indicated in the Dáil in reply to parliamentary questions, I am advised by the Central Bank that, following the failure of Home Payments Ltd. last summer, the bank inspected the bill payment and debt management sector to assess whether firms providing these services are carrying out any activity that falls to be regulated by the Central Bank and whether consumer funds may be at risk.  Following identification of a dozen companies providing these services, the first phase of the Central Bank's review has concluded with the bank writing to a number of companies notifying them that their activities are subject to regulation by the Central Bank and requiring that immediate steps be taken to provide additional protection for client funds.  The bank has advised me again today that this process is continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">The companies that are subject to regulation by the Central Bank need to determine whether they wish to apply for authorisation from the Central Bank or, alternatively, whether they wish to change their business model.  In the meantime, the Central Bank is requiring that certain controls be put in place in regard to client assets which are overseen by an independent third party.  The House will appreciate that this is being done in the public interest.  While the Central Bank is independent in the performance of its functions, I agree with the action it is taking.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">Depending on the exact business model undertaken by a firm, it may or may not be subject to regulation by the Central Bank.  I wish to inform the House that debt management firms which process payments on behalf of clients are subject to regulation under the EU Payment Services Directive.  The Payment Services Directive was transposed into domestic legislation in September 2009 and came into effect in November 2009.  Any firm which provides payment services, as defined by the legislation, requires an authorisation to trade from the Central Bank.  Again, the Central Bank has advised me that it is currently pursuing the issue with the sector and, in the interim, is advising clients of the risks involved in dealing with unauthorised firms.  I fully agree with the Central Bank's action in that regard.  The Central Bank is also advising those clients of other options available to them, such as joining their local credit union which will, generally speaking, provide bill payment services.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">The Deputy will be aware of the press statement from the Central Bank on 24 January last in regard to bill payment and debt management firms.  In the statement, the bank advised customers to be aware that the bill payment and debt management companies they have engaged may not be regulated by the Central Bank.  Where customers provide funds to an unregulated company for onward payment to a creditor, the handling of this money will not be subject to segregation and safeguarding rules.  The bank also advised customers to check directly with their creditors, for example, utilities providers, mortgage providers, credit card companies etc., without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">In regard to the company mentioned specifically by the Deputy, I am advised by the Central Bank that the company is based in Crumlin Cross in Dublin.  Under the powers granted to it under the payment services regulation, the bank has informed me that it has intervened, again in the public interest, and has frozen the accounts of the firm.  I have been informed that the Central Bank is currently engaged with the company and has been informed that the company has written to its client base to inform them that it is closing and that it will provide further information to them in due course.  Pending the finalisation of the Central Bank's engagement with the company and its report to me, I do not wish to make further comment in this House.  It would not be prudent to do so in the absence of the relevant information.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">On the basis of the experience with a number of debt management companies since last summer and on advice received from my officials I have agreed that all debt management and debt advice firms should be subject to regulation by the Central Bank.  This is an important public issue at a time which certain members of the public are straining to meet all their liabilities.  The public must have confidence in the provision of these debt management and debt advice services and there must be a proper and robust system of regulation in place.  To that end, I have instructed my officials to prepare the necessary legislation which, subject to Government approval, will be brought forward as a Committee Stage amendment to the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011.  Committee Stage of the Bill, which has already passed Second Stage, will be taken in the near future and Deputies will have the opportunity to put forward their views.</p>

That is a huge concern for the people involved.  I know the Minister is saying that he cannot comment further prior to the finalisation of the report, but people would like to hear that they will get priority and will receive their money first.  In future it will be important that companies have a bonding system to protect customers in such cases.</p>

The bank is assessing the position now to see what assets are available in the frozen accounts.  I will communicate the Deputy's concerns to the Central Bank and will stress that she sees it as an absolute necessity that customers of the company get priority in the disbursement of funds available.</p>

          <summary eId="sum_8">1.Deputy Niall Collins asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government if he intends to make up any shortfall that may emerge in the local Government fund between the estimated €160 million due to be collected in the household charge and the €164 million allocated by the Exchequer in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [5951/12]</summary>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_200">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_550">As part of the efforts to close the gap between income and expenditure in the public finances, the 2012 Exchequer allocation to local government was reduced in budget 2012 by €164 million compared to 2011.  The introduction of the household charge in 2012 is therefore timely to allow local authorities to have the necessary resources to deliver services to their communities at close to existing levels in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable to the household charge.  As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually.  The household charge is framed on a self assessment basis at a point in time.  It is a matter for those who own residential property liable to the charge to declare this and pay the charge by the due date, 31 March 2012.  As an incentive to pay the self assessment charge, late payment fees and late payment interest apply, and any amounts due and unpaid remain as a charge against the property concerned.  Such amounts will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">Over 68,000 properties have registered to pay the household charge from 1 to 31 January 2012.  This represents some €6.8 million.  The large number of people paying the charge is a clear indication of compliance with the legislation and an acceptance that the household charge is necessary to fund vital local services in our communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">Motor tax is also a source of funding to the local government fund.  I am concerned at the high level of off-the-road vehicle declarations being made, and am conscious of the need to tighten the current system of declaring vehicles off the road.  I intend to bring forward legislative proposals in the near future on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">I will be keeping the income being generated from the household charge under constant review and I and local authorities will take any necessary measures, as appropriate, in regard to compliance with the legislation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_555">As of the end of January, about 4% of households had paid the household charge and we are one third of the way through the payment period.  Concerns are being expressed by local authorities that not all the money targeted for collection will materialise.  In his reply, the Minister said that "if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually".  What measures can he take to plug the shortfall for local authorities, if there is one?</p>
            <p eId="para_556">As regards exemptions and waivers, what is the process for adding unfinished housing estates to the schedule of estates already published on the website?  Elected representatives throughout the country, including myself, have been contacted by people to say that their estates have not been included in the schedule of unfinished estates.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">Some concern has been expressed about the household charge form.  It has been brought to my attention that it does not appear to be like other normal, official Government forms.  There is no harp or departmental name on it.  It has been queried as to whether making a cheque or money order payable to "household charge" is a legal entity for the receipt of payments.  Is there a technicality concerning that?</p>
            <p eId="para_558">With regard to the receipt of payments by local authorities, if a person pays in cash they will receive a receipt, but if they pay by cheque I understand that the local authority merely takes the cheque and forwards it to the central processing unit.  If the Minister fails to collect the target of €160 million, how does he intend to compensate local authorities which have gone through their budgeting process on foot of that?</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_559">It is a hypothetical situation.  The collection date for the charge is 31 March 2012.  In line with the experience of the second home charge, approximately 4% or 5% were registered at the same time in the three-month registration period for that charge.  We are not unduly concerned because people pay at the last minute in most cases because they have the use of that money for a longer period of time.  They do not have to pay until 31 March and no penalties apply until after that.  We will examine the situation and receive the final figures for the collection process at the end of March.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">People should receive a receipt and local authorities should make offices available where they can take the money and give receipts, as set out in the legislation.  I asked the County and City Managers Association to co-operate by taking in cash where there are motor tax offices, where receipts can be provided for the money taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Regarding unfinished estates, the categories are clearly defined in the legislation, category 3 and category 4.  In general, these are not estates taken in charge by the local authority.  They have been categorised by local authorities in conjunction with the Department.</p>

The Bill has been passed by the Dáil and the Seanad and the President has signed the Bill.  What will be the process and what will be the terms of reference?  Are the draft standards available and can we see them?  Must the Minister get EU approval of the draft standards and, if so, has it been received?  Will the Minister take on board submissions from the public?  It is fine having public consultation but sometimes it is little more than a box ticking exercise to say that the Department, the Government or the council has consulted with people.  I do not want to be cynical and I take it at face value that the Minister is entering into this in a genuine way.  It is important that people's views are taken on board.  Will the standards refer to site size?</p>
            <p eId="para_573">How will noise and odours be measured?  It could be very subjective.  What level of noise from pumps will be acceptable and how will the odour level be measured?  I welcome the fact that the Minister is taking a risk-based approach.  We have discussed this many times and it is the correct way to go.  We need to give some certainty to people in high-risk areas close to aquifers and water sources, particularly those who will be in financial difficulty, that they will not be criminalised if they cannot upgrade and meet the standards very quickly as required in the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_583">The Government decided in July 2011 that a unified local authority would be established to replace the existing north and south Tipperary county councils with effect from the 2014 local elections.  An implementation group was appointed to oversee planning, preparatory work and initial implementation of the reorganisation process.  The group submitted a progress report to me in November 2011, in accordance with its terms of reference.  This report, which is published on my Department's website indicated good progress with the unification process and identified a range of positive outcomes from unification, including reduced administrative costs and overheads, effective deployment of human resources, more streamlined, effective and coherent delivery of customer services across the county, and streamlining of other existing county structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The implementation group had considered that both of the existing office headquarters in Clonmel and Nenagh should be retained with equal status and that a location in the centre of the county should be identified for meetings of the unified council.  The implementation group is due to complete an implementation plan by May 2012, which will provide further details and guide the reorganisation process up to the establishment of the unified authority in 2014.  Building on decisions already taken, including the merger of the county councils in Tipperary, I intend to bring wider policy proposals to Government in the near future on local government reform and development, with particular attention being given to strengthening local government structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels and expanding the role of local government.  Decisions on any further changes in local authority structures, including decisions on municipal governance within counties, will be a matter for the Government in that context.</p>

I welcome the fact there will be a progress report which I have seen and read.  Where will the savings be made?  The Minister said there would be savings in administration.  If there will be two headquarters, what will be different from what is currently in place?  We will have to acquire another premises unless the council meets at the Rock of Cashel, which the OPW might facilitate.  The Minister also referred to the delivery of better and more streamlined services.  I do not know how that will happen.  We will still have offices and two administrations.  The Minister has not answered my question on town councils.  I ask him to enlighten me about that in his reply.</p>

At that time I will also indicate where savings can be made by all local authorities, including Tipperary.  We can achieve a lot more in savings by streamlining all of the activities in local government to one particular structure in Co Tipperary.  We would see the effective delivery of those structures without duplication.  We have seen this happen already over the years, such as the library service which merged north and south to form one library service.  That is the sort of model we will see across a range of services delivered by local government in County Tipperary and I expect considerable savings will be made which will enhance its economic and social development.</p>

            <p eId="para_587">I will get an answer in two months time.  It is like the answer to previous questions.  We are expected to accept there will be standards but the Minister will not tell us when they will be delivered.  There is the same mystique around this.  The Minister likes to create mystique around himself and his position and we have to wait and see what will happen.  Money was put into offices in Waterford to maintain and enhance the status quo.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">We clash every September, as in the all-Ireland final which is fine because it is sporting, but there is no need to beat up those in Tipperary because we do not take kindly to that.  The Ceann Comhairle has an interest in Tipperary.  We do not lie down easily and there is an old saying: "Where Tipperary leads Ireland follows."  I ask the Minister to make haste slowly.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">I do not see where savings can be made because where there was one headquarters there will now be two.  I understand from some colleagues that the Minister has changed his mind on the town council aspect.  I will have to wait for white smoke from the Fine Gael early Parliamentary Party like we had last night.  I welcome what was decided.  Perhaps something will happen here.  I am not happy.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">Why did the Minister pick retired Government officials to be part of the advisory group when 465,000 people are unemployed, some of whom are highly skilled and have a clean image?  I am not saying the officials were bad but they are retired and were obviously partisan because of their views over the years.  The Minister knows that.  Why did he not pick unemployed people rather than bringing back retired people?  He also appointed a north Tipperary county manager to chair the group which is not fair to south Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_600">The Government in 2011 set out a broad and ambitious programme for political reform.  Responsibility for this rests with a number of Ministers.  My responsibility is in the areas of electoral and local government reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">On 15 December 2011, I published the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill.   This makes provision for the restriction of corporate donations, a reduction in the amounts that can be received as political donations and a reduction in the thresholds for declaring such donations.  Political parties will be required to submit their annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The Bill also includes a provision linking the achievement of a gender balance in the selection of candidates of political parties at a general election to the State funding provided to parties under the Electoral Act 1997.  The Bill commenced Second Stage in the Seanad today and I look forward to its early enactment in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">The Government legislative programme announced on 11 January makes provision for the publication in 2012 of the electoral (amendment) (referendum spending and miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  This Bill will provide for the disclosure of expenditure and donations at referendum campaigns and for the extension of the spending limit period that applies at presidential, Dáil, European and local elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011, enacted in July 2011, changed the terms of reference of the constituency commission to provide for a reduced number of Deputies.  Section 9(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 requires a constituency commission to present its report to the Chairman of the Dáil no later than three months after the publication by the CSO of the final results of the census in respect of the total population of the State.  I understand the CSO intends to publish the final results of the 2011 census at the end of March 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">Based on the experience with reports presented by previous constituency commissions, I expect to bring forward legislation this year arising from the constituency commission's report.  I will outline my plans for local government reform later when replying to the separate questions on today's Order Paper. As I already indicated to Deputy McGrath, I expect to bring proposals to Government in two months' time.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">I thank the Minister.  On the proposals on local government reform, to which he alluded in his reply, he said he will bring forward his proposals on town councils.  In my county, Limerick, Limerick City Council and County Council will merge into a single entity.  We have to be very careful not to dilute democracy and local government representation completely.  The combined number of local representatives on both the authorities is 45 and the figure being mooted is between 32 and 34.  The matter will have to be thrashed out.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">If one is going to pursue a policy of retaining town and borough councils, which has merit because it is local democracy, one has to bear in mind that local public representatives cost a relatively insignificant amount of money in the overall scheme of local government.  While we are trying to achieve savings by merging entities, the majority of costs do not involve local public representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">We need to get the balance right in terms of not diluting local democracy completely.  It would not make sense to have a 32 member single authority in Limerick and retain seven town councils in a neighbouring county such as Tipperary.  Such a situation would not be equitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">I ask the Minister to enlighten us as to whether he intends to proceed with directly elected mayor in Limerick.  He listed his agenda for other areas of political reform.  I understand changing the voting age is in the programme for Government.  What is the position on the proposal to abolish the Seanad?</p>

            <p eId="para_610">The proposal to abolish the Seanad is a matter for another Minister and the Government has not yet decided when that will happen.  It is in the programme for Government and it will make a decision in due course.  Directly elected mayors will be considered in the context of local government reform and no conclusions have been reached on that in Limerick, Dublin or anywhere else.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">On the general view that public representatives do not contribute much to the savings, I agree that representational allowances and expenses are a small part of the overall budgets but they are supported by a considerable number of administrative and other staff across the various programme areas in town and county councils.  At a time when there are very serious financial problems and when we are interested in devolving more functions and powers, and streamlining the effective delivery of services, it is only reasonable to consider the fact there are too many councillors and councils.  This will be reflected in the proposals I will bring forward in two months.  It is already reflected in what I am doing in Limerick city and county, and in north and south County Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">The housing agency is working with NAMA to determine the social housing demand for individual properties identified by NAMA.  In that context, the agency is contacting the relevant local authorities to consider existing demand in terms of numbers, types and locations of properties required to meet social housing needs in the relevant authorities.  The agency will provide a co-ordinated response to NAMA with a view to securing as many of the properties as are suitable as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">The units being advanced through NAMA will, in general, be provided through the social housing leasing initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply in that scheme.  A local authority will have the option of leasing the properties directly from the relevant borrower or receiver.  Alternatively, an approved housing body may secure the properties through direct leasing or, in some cases, by purchasing using private or HFA finance and leasing them back to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">It is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost of leasing these properties.  Lease costs are determined by negotiation using a standard discounted market price which may vary to reflect the circumstances of a particular case and the terms of the contractual agreement.  The current average annual cost of units leased from the private or voluntary sector under the leasing scheme generally is approximately €7,400.</p>

            <p eId="para_617">NAMA bought the debts at a reduced rate.  It did not buy the properties.  Would it not make more sense to call in the debts and have the properties returned to the State fully owned if the property developers cannot deliver?  It does not make sense for local authorities to rent from developers who, in turn, will use the money to pay NAMA.  Will the money go directly to NAMA or to the property developers who, in turn, will pay off NAMA?  Since the scheme is a lease scheme, does this mean the properties will be returned to the developers?  If so, they will have it both ways in that they will get their properties back and the local authorities and housing associations will pay the debts.  This is a matter of the State paying on the double.  It does not make sense.  Could the Minister of State address some of these points?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_618">The proposal is to achieve value for money for the State.  The capital budget has been reducing considerably in recent years and is quite low at this stage.  We are obtaining good value for the State in that we are accommodating a sizeable number of people under leasing arrangements.  Approximately 20,000 households are accommodated under leasing and RAS arrangements.  NAMA properties will be under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">We must operate according to the law.  NAMA has been given a legal role and, although we may wish local authorities could acquire properties for nothing from NAMA, the reality is that this cannot be done.  The properties in NAMA are there because the owners concerned cannot pay their debts.  This is a way of using the properties available under NAMA to house families who need housing in a way that represents value for money and which will work for those concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">The Deputy stated approximately 2,000 units have been made available.  We must assess whether they are suitable and in appropriate areas.  There are a number of elements that must be determined but what will happen in effect is that approximately 2,000 units will be made available for social housing in various parts of the country.  They will provide homes for people.  While we might wish to obtain the properties for nothing, this simply cannot happen; it is not a realistic proposal.  They must be acquired at market values and in a way that works under the regular leasing systems already in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_622">The Minister of State said the scheme may result in a short-term gain, but in the longer term it is not in the best interest of the country.  It is certainly not in the interest of the State that we are paying developers to pay off NAMA.  It does not make sense.  We should consider another way of doing business.

It has a social element and this is in the legislation.  It is in accordance with this element that houses are being sought for those in need of them around the country.  The State is ensuring this will be done in a way that represents value for money and which provides good homes for the people who need them.  This work is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Under the legislation, NAMA must operate in a way that provides some return to the taxpayer.  Ultimately, the taxpayer must be protected.  I am very happy as Minister of State responsible for housing to stand over what we are doing in this regard.  The people who will ultimately be accommodated because of this will also be very happy.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">6<b>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</b> asked the <b>Minister for the Environment; Community and Local Government</b> his plans to encourage financial institutions to lend money on a fixed rate to voluntary housing associations for the development of their housing stock. [5923/12]</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_626">The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, identifies approved housing bodies, AHBs, as key partners in the delivery of social housing.  This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track record of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement.  However, the move from capital-funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue-funded options does present challenges for them.  As such, I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance to both the sector and its external partners as the sector takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The development of such a regulatory framework which is both robust and harmonised with the varying capacities of individual AHBs will take some time.  In the interim, my Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse.  This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">In the shorter term, to assist in this transitional phase between fully capital-funded delivery programmes and greater reliance on borrowing, my Department's capital advance leasing facility, CALF, scheme allows approved housing bodies to apply for a capital equity injection to assist them to secure finance from financial institutions and the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of acquiring or constructing dwellings for social housing purposes under the leasing initiative.  Direct loan financing by financial institutions will be part of the Government's mortgage-to-rent pilot scheme under which the purchase of the property will be part loan financed using loan finance obtained from the initial mortgage provider.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
            <p eId="para_630">I have met many of the voluntary housing associations in recent months.  Many of the associations are looking to buy housing units but they are having great difficulty raising money through financial institutions.  Concerns have also been raised that interest rates, while low at present, if they rise could create problems in keeping rents at fair rates for their tenants.  This is why there is talk of a fixed rate given we do not know what will happen in the future.  Many of these associations are hanging on a limb with regard to their funding as matters stand.  They could be driven to the wall if rates changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">The Minister of State referred to the capital advance leasing facility, CALF.  This does not seem to be given sufficient support in regard to the associations' endeavours to secure funding, or that is the sense which comes across from them.  The best solution to the housing crisis is a State-led development of social housing units.  In this vein, the Government has sought to relinquish responsibility to the voluntary sector.  Increasingly, it seems the issue of social housing is being directed to the voluntary housing sector at the expense of social housing provision and those on waiting lists.  That seems to be where the funding is going.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_632">The voluntary housing sector plays a very positive role and the State wants to work with the sector.  To take Britain as an example, that sector plays a strong role there as well.  The Deputy will be aware that the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, can also provide finance.  It is a good mechanism and provides good interest rates, which we expect will come down in the near future.  We want to assist the voluntary housing sector in whatever way we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">One of the issues I referred to in my response is that we need to ensure these bodies are properly regulated, and we are working towards that.  There will be much more confidence from financial institutions in lending to voluntary housing associations if they are in a regulated situation.  The CALF system of funding is relatively new and it will certainly grow in the years to come.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">The Minister of State referred to CALF.  It does not appear the facility is able to ensure suitable loan conditions.  The Minister of State also referred to the HFA.  I would like to think the Minister of State will strengthen her efforts to provide public money through the HFA.  On another issue, how many publicly owned social housing units will be built in 2012?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_635">I do not have an exact figure for social housing at this stage as, obviously, some units will be approved and go to tender and so on during the course of the year.  I will come back to the Deputy with information that is as accurate as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">The reality is there is not a huge level of public money and we have to ensure we get the best possible methods in place whereby we can provide homes for people.  In some cases, these will be directly built in the traditional way but we must also find other ways, including using voluntary housing associations and encouraging private capital to help with that.  Ultimately, what we are focused on is providing homes in whatever way we can for those who need them in what are very difficult financial times for the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_642">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 34, 55, 163 and 164 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">I am adopting a progressive approach to the reform and development of local government in accordance with the programme for Government.  Decisions have already been taken to merge the authorities in Limerick and Tipperary and implementation work is proceeding in both cases.  I have also established a local government committee to consider whether Waterford city and county councils should be unified.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">I intend to bring wider policy proposals to Government in the near future which will build on these early actions, with particular attention being given to strengthening local government structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels and expanding the role of local government, including proposals in regard to municipal governance within counties.  In this context, I am also consulting ministerial colleagues to consider what functions and services of their Departments and of bodies under their aegis could potentially be devolved to local government.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">The proposals will reflect work under way in regard to alignment of local and community development with local government and local government efficiency implementation.  They will also broadly map out further aspects of the local government system on which reform proposals will be considered, including a range of governance matters such as ethics, local political and executive leadership, and the balance between elected members and the executive in the performance of functions.  The future designation and role of the county manager will be among the matters for consideration in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">Primary legislation will be required in the first instance to provide for transitional management arrangements in Limerick and Tipperary until the establishment of a unified local authority in both counties in 2014.  Further substantive legislation will be required to implement, with effect from the 2014 local elections, the full amalgamation of the authorities in question and establishment of their successors.  The need for any additional legislation related to the wider policy proposals will be examined, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, when these matters have been decided by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">I thank the Minister.  First, will he clarify his position in regard to the delivery of water services?  If he establishes the proposed water company, where stands the existing function within the local authorities?  Is it his proposal to transfer the staff to the new water company or will they ultimately face redundancy or job losses?  Will he clarify the position in that regard also?</p>
            <p eId="para_648">Second, with regard to local authority managers, is it his intention when considering the overall posts, structures and terms of reference for local authority managers to limit the duration of their appointments to, say, three, five or seven years, similar to the position in semi-State bodies at present?</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_649">I am examining the term of office of the managers and the role they would have, in conjunction with the board of directors, who are the democratically elected people in local government.  The chief executive officer is the manager but the board of directors should be the elected members.  The balance between management, managers and local elected members is under discussion.  The term of office is also included with that and will have to fit in with the wider public service reform proposals which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is working on.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">With regard to water and related staff, I am anxious to maintain the local expertise and knowledge that has been developed over many years in local government to enhance the delivery of the Irish water entity that will ultimately have to come to Government for decision.  I expect this will be between now and the end of this Dáil session.  The question of how many staff will be required and what role local government will play is obviously under discussion.  I expect that local government staff will continue to play a very meaningful role in the delivery of our water services.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">The Minister should take a serious look at the functions.  Many issues could be dealt with at local level and should not be dealt with at national level, and many powers should also be shifted back to local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_665">I am pleased to hear the Minister's last few phrases about the need to get back to having citizens involved in decisions that affect them.  When he is deliberating on local government reform will he consider not only the need to devolve power back to local authorities but, wherever possible,  devolving power, decision making and participation to the citizens?  There has been considerable alienation of local communities from their local authorities because of a feeling that decisions are made over their heads in favour of developers, or whatever.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">In that regard, and following the controversies in areas such as Corrib and, lately, the Kish in regard to applications for drilling licences on the foreshore, will the Minister agree it should not be at his discretion only there should be public inquiries on these matters but that it should be mandatory to have a public inquiry concerning any oil or gas exploration within the foreshore area?  Perhaps the Minister could make a start in moving in that direction by indicating he will allow for a public inquiry on the Providence Resources application to drill for oil and gas off the Dalkey and Killiney coastline.</p>

We have respect for democracy, local government and the law and we will not treat politics by having local elections every week.  That might be what Deputy Boyd Barrett would like but I believe in giving people a mandate over a period of time in order to implement a local set of services and policies.

I am anxious that as many functions as possible in terms of raising money locally for delivery of services to the citizen should be introduced.  That is what the household charge is about.  It is ringfenced for delivery of local services.  It is the same with the more progressive and fairer system of property tax that is being generated in the coming months.  That, too, will be applicable to local government services and for their delivery.  It is not sustainable that at present we have small businesses supporting in a major way the delivery of local services.  It puts them under financial pressure.  I want to broaden the tax base in order to ensure we have maintenance of employment at local level and less pressure on local businesses than is the case at present with the collection of commercial rates.  I will be looking at all financial opportunities to be ringfenced at local government level, where moneys will be collected and administered by local government for the delivery of those services.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">I reiterate one point made by Deputy Stanley in regard to local government reform.  It relates to the power of managers.  We have seen this with Dublin City Council which has accumulated powers that were passed by the Oireachtas.  It gave the council too much power while local councillors were relegated down the chain in terms of what they could and could not do.  I would like to see those powers weaned away from managers and back to councillors who would have the ability to deal with them.  I hope that is part of the Minister's agenda as he looks at reform of the local authorities.  There are areas in which managers are making decisions and local councillors have no input or, if they do, the manager overrides them.  This is a very important area that needs to be examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">Abdication is never democracy.  This is a responsibility for local councillors.  They must take it and make hard decisions about raising money and delivering local services.  They have to make choices.  If one wants true local democracy people have to make choices based on the resources available.  The management system we have at present is tilted too much in favour of the management and against the democratic wishes of elected members.  I am going to change that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_684">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 176 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">The 2012 allocation for the local and community development programme, LCDP, as provided for in the budget, is €55.157 million, which represents a reduction of some €8 million on the funding available in 2011.  I am confident, however, that the budget allocation will allow for the continuation of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities and will allow for the key, essential, front-line services delivered through the programme to be maintained for 2012.  I am also confident that the adjustment to the programme has been structured to protect front-line services and supports at the expense of administration, overheads and ancillary costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">In determining the 2012 budgets for the individual local development companies, every effort is being made to protect the viability of smaller companies.  This is reflected in the lower than average budget reduction of 10% that is being applied to these groups.  Although the reductions will unavoidably present challenges to all delivery bodies, I nevertheless expect that groups will continue to maintain key services and supports through prioritising resources at the front-line.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">The allocations to local development companies under the LCDP are made by Pobal, which manages the programme on behalf of my Department.  Allocations are based on a number of factors, including the size and population of the catchment areas of the companies, the proposed annual programme of activity of each company, the deprivation index for the catchment areas and the available funding for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">The annual planning process is currently underway in the local development companies.  I have not so far been made aware of any services that will cease as a result of the cuts.</p>

            <p eId="para_689">I have one brief point.  The programme is essential.  In his reply, the Minister stated he would deliver key services and we agree with that.  It is important for these groups to have some certainty around funding in order to maintain services.  One finds with many of these groups that they have multiple sources of funding.  Some of them have suffered a range of cuts.  When one adds all the cuts together they might come to 30% or 40%.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_690">Deputy Stanley has put his finger on it in regard to the duplication of resources that can come from various locations, bodies and Departments for particular communities.  We are examining that intensively in the context of our budgets.  We are also examining the alignment of the community sector with local government.  This is all being taken into account to see where there is administrative duplication while at the same time protecting front line services to the citizen.  Deputy Keating recently highlighted an example in which several Departments may be feeding into the delivery of a local community service.  It is about establishing the best vehicle for delivery of that service while at the same time maintaining front line services.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effect of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended in 1997 and 2003, specifies projects which, by virtue of their nature, size or location are likely to have significant effects on the environment and should be subject to an environmental impact assessment, EIA.  Article 4(1) of the directive requires projects listed in Annex I of the directive to be subject to an EIA while Article 4(2) provides that for projects listed in Annex II of the directive member states may determine, either through case by case examination or by setting thresholds or criteria, or both, whether such projects are to be subject to an EIA.  The provisions of the EIA directive are transposed into Irish legislation by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Under the regulations, an EIA is mandatory for the construction of overhead electrical power lines with a voltage of 220 kV or more and a length of more than 15 km.  However, where a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála considers that a development proposal which is below the specified threshold is likely to have significant environmental effects, it is obliged to request an environmental impact statement from the developer.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">The issue of the erection of overhead power lines is causing huge angst across the country.  There is a planned overhead power line in Ratheniska in County Laois, for example, causing concerns.  If a power line is over 15 km, it is mandatory for an environmental impact statement to be provided by the developer.  What are the Minister of State's views on undergrounding electrical power lines?  The report commissioned last July by her Government colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, on undergrounding power cables concluded that the cost of undergrounding is almost equal to that of erecting overhead power lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">In Europe, only 450 km of overhead lines are currently being constructed while up to 700 km of electrical lines are being put underground.  European electricity suppliers are going the way of undergrounding.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">Putting in place overhead cables also causes delays in the delivery of infrastructure projects.  We saw that recently in Offaly where there was a dispute over an overhead power line going through a grove of trees which took a long time to resolve.  Until now the argument against undergrounding was that it was too costly and could not be done.  The report commissioned by the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, claims undergrounding can be done at the same cost as overhead cables, be quicker and a lot less hassle.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
            <p eId="para_700">The programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The memorandum of understanding with the EU, IMF and the ECB also contains commitments for the reform of water services delivery and operation and the introduction of domestic water charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">To meet these commitments, the Government intends initiating a universal water metering programme in advance of the introduction of water charges.  This will facilitate moving to a charging system for domestic water users that is based on use above a free allowance as provided for in the programme for Government.  A procurement strategy for the metering programme is being finalised and it is intended that procurement will be addressed at a national and regional level rather than county by county.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">On 16 January 2012, I commenced a public consultation on the Government's proposals for reform of water services delivery including metering and water charges, seeking views from the public on the establishment of a public water utility and the introduction of water charges.  The details of the consultation process can be found on my Department's website and submissions can be made to my Department until 24 February 2012.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_280">
            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_703">The consultation process will offer people the opportunity to make an input into this process.  I will be sending in a submission.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">Has the Minister considered the issue of road-openings affecting the installation of water meters?  Hundreds of thousands of these will have to be performed on footpaths and in housing estates.  What will happen in an estate that has not been taken in charge by the local authority, as a road-opening licence cannot be made by the local authority in such a case?  What is the legal position on this?  Will meters be external or smart internal systems?</p>
            <p eId="para_705">Last year during the cold spell, it was discovered that many water pipes into houses were only four inches under the ground when the minimum requirement was 18 inches.  Water meters will be much larger than four inches.  How will they fit into these installations?  Once temperatures go down below zero, these meters could also freeze.  Many water supply pipes to houses may have to be put down further into the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">The Minister of State estimates the overall cost of rolling out water meters will be €500 million.  That breaks down to the small figure of approximately €250 per house.  Given the extent of the work to be done, the roll-out of metering may be closer to €900 million, even with reduced rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">From the experience of our neighbours across the water where water meters have been fitted, it has not led to a significant reduction in water consumption.  Having dual flush toilets can lead to a 12% reduction in water consumption.  Building standards regulations could be introduced to ensure when toilets are replaced it is with a dual flush model, as happens in Spain.  That is a practical measure to cut down household water consumption which could be introduced by the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">The Deputy has posed many questions, some of which I may not be able to answer today.  I will be happy to follow them up with him later.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">This is the largest infrastructure project since the establishment of the ESB during the foundation of the State.  Irish Water will be established as an entity by the middle of this year and will deal with the contracts for the installation of water meters.  It will be working with local authorities which will be agents for Irish Water over several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">Water meters do work.  There is clear evidence from local authorities on how water meters in commercial premises and domestic households have lead to significant reductions in consumption.  The lowest amount in reduction in domestic consumption was 10% while group water schemes have reported reductions of up to 30% in their consumption.  It is a significant reduction.  The contracts will be prepared on the basis of splitting the country into 150 to 200 areas.  The intention is to offer SMEs and smaller local businesses opportunities to get stuck in.  As more than 2,000 jobs will be created, it will have an important impact on the community, as well as on the environment in terms of water conservation.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">In many of the older houses in places like Whitehall, Finglas and Walkinstown water is supplied through lead pipes.  Will part of the €500 million be allocated to address this issue?  These households will incur huge costs in adapting their water pipes.  I have encountered issues in Finglas, Ballymun and Whitehall whereby pipes leak occasionally.  It will not be possible to connect meters to these pipes.</p>

These grant schemes are funded by 80% recoupment from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_801">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 29 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">The programme for Government is committed to adopting a housing first, housing led approach to homelessness and to ensuring more effective prevention strategies.  There is no single solution to increasing the level of social housing supply for the homeless and maximising delivery will require flexible and diverse approaches.  The initial emphasis will necessarily be on the Dublin region, where homeless numbers are most acute, and moving away from the current over reliance on emergency accommodation provision to a more permanent accommodation solution.  This is to be achieved through a number of measures including: directly linking the provision of funding with specific targets and outcomes; making better use of the existing available accommodation units in the local authorities and in the voluntary sector; additional social housing provision through acquisitions and remedial works or upgrading of vacant local authority housing stock and a leasing programme; ongoing engagement with NAMA to secure properties; targeted use of the rental accommodation scheme; an enhanced role for the private rental sector; better co-ordination with the voluntary and co-operative housing sector; and the establishment of homeless action teams across all regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">My Department's funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is €50 million, which together with 10% provided from housing authorities' own resources, brings the total available funding to €55.55 million in 2012.  This level of funding means that there will be no reduction in the provision of essential front line support services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
            <p eId="para_804">The date set for ending homelessness passed and we never succeeded in meeting our goal.  There is talk about a strategy being put in place by 2013 or 2014 but does the Minister of State seriously believe this is a realistic date?  I do not believe it is achievable.  Has a timeline been set out for the homelessness strategy?  At this moment people are sleeping on the streets outside Leinster House, which is a terrible indictment of our society.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_291" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government__Deputy_Jan_O_Sullivan">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_805">I agree we must do all we can on homelessness.  This was one of the priorities I outlined when I was appointed to my position of Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  A substantial sum, €50 million, has been allocated to the issue, in addition to the funding provided by local authorities.  We have to ensure it is spent in a way that provides homes, which is the best response to homelessness.  That will necessitate supporting vulnerable people in their homes in many cases because they will not always be able to survive on their own.  Some of the voluntary associations and statutory bodies have been strong at providing that kind of support and the strategy for Dublin is focused on the best use of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">All of us want to end homelessness at the earliest opportunity but I do not think funding is the problem.  Some people need a lot of support in terms of being provided with secure homes and we have to focus our policies on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_814">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 32, 33, 35 and 39 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">Primary policy responsibility for the exploitation of offshore natural resources, including the tax regime applicable to such projects, is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Such projects are subject to a number of statutory consents under the Gas Acts, and the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act. Projects involving works within the 12 nautical mile outer limit of the foreshore are also subject to consent under the Foreshore Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">My Department has received an application from Providence Resources for a foreshore licence in respect of site investigations and the drilling of an exploratory well off Dalkey. This is the first such application under foreshore legislation for this type of project.  The application is currently the subject of a public consultation procedure which commenced on 5 January 2012. The closing date for the receipt of submissions by my Department is today. The application has been referred to standard prescribed body consultees including the Marine Institute, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. In addition, and owing to the nature of the proposal, the application has also been referred to Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Wicklow County Council, Dublin Port Company, Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Given the nature of the application, the fact that it is the subject of a public consultation process, and that the decision and related documentation, including the submissions received under the public consultation process, will be published on my Department's website, I do not consider that a public inquiry is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">The proposal will be the subject of an environmental assessment by the scientific and technical advisors on the marine licence vetting committee. Their assessment will involve a detailed examination of the application and related information and the issues raised in the submissions received on foot of the consultation process. The extent of the environmental assessment required will also be informed by the issues that may emerge from the prescribed body and public consultations. It would be expected that the environmental assessment will consider impacts on European sites, sensitive species, other legitimate uses within the area that is the subject of the application, and navigation issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">I will make a determination on the application in due course, taking account of the recommendation of the marine licence vetting committee and my Department.  Should the project progress to commercial exploitation, it would be the subject of further applications for consents from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in the first instance, and then An Bord Pleanála under the Planning Acts, and a lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts, all of which will require the submission of an environmental impact statement and environmental impact assessments by the relevant consent authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_823">The charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, particularly the conditions attached to each waste collector's collection permit issued by the relevant local authority under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, as amended. Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011. A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests. As one might expect, a consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals in relation to household waste collection to Government by Easter this year. All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives. Issues including pricing structures, value for money and service standards will be among the issues for consideration in this context.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_827">This Government remains committed to the regeneration of the estates and communities in our most disadvantaged areas. Despite the current adverse economic conditions and consequent Exchequer constraints, we continue to prioritise funding for regeneration within the overall social housing programme.  Last year alone my Department provided €118 million for regeneration, representing 25% of the total housing capital investment programme.  Of this, €55 million was invested in Limerick with a significant amount of this being expended on essential strategic and preparatory work, including the purchase of strategic sites in the city centre and elsewhere, to allow progress towards the critical construction phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Over the course of 2011, the regeneration programme largely transitioned from the planning and early interventions phase to construction and implementation.  This work will continue in 2012. My Department envisages more than 100 new housing units commencing construction in the current year with many more being progressed through the various stages of planning.  In addition, I have directed the Regeneration Agencies and the City Council to prepare plans for improving the existing housing which is suitable for retention within the estates. It is important to note that all projects and interventions receiving support from my Department must be based on a thorough and sound analysis of the needs of the community. To this end, the Agencies, with the Council, are currently finalising robust, evidence-based implementation plans which will provide greater clarity and a road map for the implementation of projects over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The merger of the two local authorities presents a further opportunity to build on the foundations already laid by ensuring that regeneration takes a central role in the programme of the new unitary authority. I will be visiting the regeneration areas tomorrow where I intend to set out my vision for the future of regeneration in Limerick. I am confident that this will meet with the support of all stakeholders and help accelerate the long awaited and much-needed implementation phase of the regeneration project.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">In October 2011, I announced further measures in relation to my Department's agency rationalisation programme with the overall number of agencies being reduced from 21 to 12.  Overall, estimated savings in the order of €1.9 million have been achieved to date in the agency rationalisation process and I anticipate that this should rise significantly. Agency staff numbers are targeted to fall to 712 by 2015 as compared to 951 at the end of 2008 — a reduction of 239 (25%).</p>
            <p eId="para_832">An Chomhairle Leabharlanna will be dissolved, with any key residual functions to be subsumed into the Local Government Management Agency. The dissolution should result in savings in terms of annual operating costs of the order of €1m and could yield a once-off windfall through disposal of its headquarters in Dublin's City centre.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) rationalises the functions of three Agencies. The Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are merging as the Local Government Management Agency.  The Limerick Northside and South side Regeneration Agencies will be replaced through the development of new management arrangements in the context of the merger of Limerick City and Limerick County Council.  The Dormant Accounts Board (Amendment) Bill 2011 proposes to dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board.  The agency rationalisation/efficiency agenda will be kept under review, taking the Public Service Reform Plan's recommendations into account, in so far as all agencies under my Department's aegis are concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">The household charge is a local authority charge, the proceeds of which will be used to fund vital local services in our communities.  The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the household charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund.  I will disburse monies back to local authorities in general-purpose grants. It is considered that this approach is preferable to allowing local authorities directly retain all moneys collected from the household charge in their areas, as it will make it possible for me to equalise distribution, ensuring that those local authorities with lower populations than others do not suffer unduly as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable to the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually.  The household charge is framed on a self assessment basis at a point in time.  It is a matter for those who own residential property liable to the charge to declare this and to pay the charge by the due date, 31 March 2012.  As an incentive to pay the self assessment charge, late payment fees and late payment interest apply and any amounts due and unpaid remain as a charge against the property concerned.  Such amounts will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.  Over 68,000 properties have registered to pay the household charge from 1 January to 31 January.  This represents some €6.8m.<b> </b> The large numbers of people paying the charge is a clear indication of compliance with the legislation and the acceptance that the household charge is necessary to fund vital local services in our communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">I will be keeping the income being generated from the household charge under constant review and I and local authorities will take any necessary measures, as appropriate, in regard to compliance with the legislation.</p>

Based on estimates from local authorities it is anticipated that a further 755 staff may leave the sector by end 2012.  The recruitment moratorium in the Public Service was introduced by the Government in March 2009 as an emergency measure in response to the financial crisis facing the State and the moratorium remains in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained. My Department operates the moratorium in relation to local authorities on delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. My Department works very closely with local authorities to ensure that critical posts are filled while overall numbers are reduced. In this regard, some 2,600 sanction requests have been dealt with by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">A joint working group of the City and County Managers Association and my Department has been established to deal with staffing issues.

            <p eId="para_845">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">Section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the exemption of certain developments from planning requirements. Under the provisions of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 2001 Planning Regulations, works consisting of, or incidental to, the carrying out of development in compliance with a notice under Section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 is an exempted development. Such notices are issued by local authorities in order to prevent or control pollution of waters, including pollution arising from on-site waste water treatment and disposal systems.  I anticipate that works arising from the implementation of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 will be treated similarly to those arising from notices issued under Section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">I have committed, during the consideration of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 by the Oireachtas, to examine what further amendments to the exempted development provisions of planning legislation will be necessary where remediation or upgrading of domestic waste water treatment systems arises from implementation of the inspection requirements of the new legislation.  There is nothing in the Bill which would require a householder to purchase additional lands. Where a septic tank or other on-site waste water treatment system is found to be causing risk to human health or the environment, a decision regarding the remediation work to be carried out will be based not only on the exact nature of the failure in the tank or system and the extent of the risk to health and the environment but also on issues such as existing site size and hydrological and geological conditions. The most appropriate and cost-effective engineering solution available will inform the work to be specified in an advisory notice.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">A key objective of the new legislation is to enhance and protect public health and the environment, including drinking water quality, on an on-going basis.  The national inspection plan, which will be prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, will target inspections to areas where the risks to human health and the environment arising from failing septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems are greatest. The local authorities will be responsible for implementing the plan within their functional areas. The national inspection plan will be updated by the Agency at least once every five years, having regard to the outcomes of inspections and technical advancements in the area of waste water treatment. While the objective of the legislation is to identify treatment systems which may be causing risks to public health and the environment, and to ensure the removal of such risks, it is simply not possible to speculate whether or not there will continue to be treatment systems causing pollution once the new arrangements are in place.</p>

The Council is also the designated housing authority under the Housing Acts.  The legal proceedings in relation to Priory Hall are continuing and it would be inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">My own responsibility, as Minister, is to ensure that appropriate statutory requirements, technical standards and administrative provisions are put in place under the relevant legislation.  This responsibility is not in dispute.  I have no role in relation to enforcement activity or in relation to the direct provision of housing services.  Residents at Priory Hall and their representatives have previously been advised of this standing division of responsibilities.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to meet the residents at this point.  While I appreciate the very difficult circumstances which they are experiencing I must act appropriately and within my powers, particularly in a case such as this which is already the subject of legal proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The overriding priority is to facilitate the return by residents to their homes as early as possible.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and I have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.  I urge all concerned to allow the Council to continue to deal with this situation in line with the standard arrangements in place for the discharge of its statutory functions.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">I am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government's response to the recommendations. The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months. In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.  To date, my Department has made allocations totalling €2,548,305 to fifteen local authorities from the funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues.</p>

This is reflected in the Government's Housing Policy Statement of June 2011 which sets out the measures which will be taken to address housing need in an innovative solution-based approach which recognises the financial reality which must be faced.  My Department asked housing authorities to submit their proposals for consideration for funding under the Social Housing Investment Programme for the next three years by the end of January.  Once the proposals submitted have been assessed it will be possible to estimate the number of new social units to be built over the period. I hope to be in a position to make announcements in relation to budgets or allocations for the various housing supply programmes in early March.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">My Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010. That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank's first statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">The 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) is a twenty-year planning framework designed to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions, and it provides the spatial vision and principles for statutory regional planning guidelines across eight regions and for development plans at a local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">A comprehensive review of implementation of the NSS was undertaken during 2010, culminating in the publication in October 2010 of the NSS Update and Outlook Report (available at <i>www.environ.ie</i>).  This report reaffirms the commitment to implementing long-term planning frameworks such as the NSS and identifies new priorities and objectives to deliver more consistent implementation at all levels, taking account of experience since 2002 and the new environmental, budgetary and economic challenges that we are currently facing.  In particular, the 2010 Report identifies a series of actions in respect of:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_881">better alignment and prioritisation of sectoral infrastructure investment,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_882">improved governance at national, regional and local levels, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_883">the promotion of more sustainable patterns of development, both in rural and urban contexts, through more effective, evidence-based planning policies, with the aim of maximising the role of NSS implementation in supporting overall economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">In addition, the adoption of updated Regional Planning Guidelines in 2010 for the twelve-year period to 2022 and the new legislative provisions to include core strategies in development plans, taking account of regional policies, targets and priorities, are further embedding the NSS principles into the forward-planning process, and should help to deliver more co-ordinated, coherent and sustainable planning outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">My Department will as necessary consider the need for any further such review in the light of the current evolving economic circumstances and the beneficial deployment of the currently more constrained resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_887">My Department provided funding of €12.2 million to Cork City Council in 2011 for the delivery of two major regeneration projects at Knocknaheeny and the Glen.  A major focus of the regeneration programme in 2011 was the completion of the review of the Knocknaheeny regeneration master plan.  This revised plan, now covering a wider area including Hollyhill, recently received support from both the City Council and the community and represents a significant step forward for the regeneration of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">The revised master plan presents a much broader view, beyond a simple upgrading of the housing stock, to address the underlying issues of social exclusion and socio-economic disadvantage. This plan builds on the foundations of previous initiatives, including the redevelopment of Knocknaheeny Block D which delivered 78 refurbished dwellings, 42 new housing units and the well-known "drum" community centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">I intend to make sufficient funding available under the 2012 allocations to enable real progress to be made in implementing the revised plan. My Department will liaise closely with Cork City Council in the context of determining the work programme for 2012 and the associated necessary capital allocations, within the wider National Regeneration Programme.  At this stage, it seems likely that the programme will deliver the first relocations to facilitate demolition, public realm upgrades including addressing areas of anti-social behaviour, and significant investment in social regeneration activities including improvements to McSwiney Hall.  My Department will also be supporting the delivery of the Glen Phase II new housing project.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 43 and 58 to 60, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The Programme for Government commits to reviewing and updating the current homeless strategy and to adopting a "housing-led" approach to homelessness.  Work now under way on updating the strategy is almost complete and will involve the establishment of clear performance targets and associated timelines.  Targets should not be simply aspirational but should be realistic, measurable and achievable.  A particular emphasis will necessarily be on the delivery of accommodation units for homeless persons through the policy approach outlined in the Housing Policy Statement of June 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">Although it is regrettable that we did not reach the target of ending long term homelessness by the end of 2010, as envisaged by the current homeless strategy, the commitment remains as strong as ever and I am ensuring it continues to be a priority in 2012.  However, much progress has been made in otherwise implementing the strategy including <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_903">the publication of a detailed Implementation Plan in April 2009, which set out a range of priority actions to be undertaken to deliver on the six strategic aims of the Strategy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_904">new legislative provisions in the Housing Act 2009 that came into force on 1 February 2010, which put Homelessness Fora and Homelessness Action Plans on a statutory basis and are now being implemented at regional and local level;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_905">the adoption in 2010 by the 34 City and County Councils of their statutory Homelessness Action Plans;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_906">annual provision of current funding to provide for sufficient bed capacity to accommodate all those in need of emergency accommodation nationwide and to deliver on the commitment to eliminate the need for persons to involuntarily sleep rough;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_907">the ongoing reconfiguration of existing emergency or transitional homeless facilities to provide a substantial number of secure long-term tenancies for homeless persons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_908">the development of a scheme, <i> Support to Live Independently,</i> to provide visiting supports for persons leaving homelessness which assists people progress from homelessness to independent living in mainstream housing and forms an important element of follow up action to end long term homelessness, by co-ordinating appropriate tenancy and other supports to meet each individuals needs in their local community setting; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_909">the new homelessness on-line data and bed management system PASS which is now operational in Dublin and to be rolled out nationally this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">The National Implementation Plan for the Homeless Strategy also provides for the development of a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related funding to housing authorities with emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency, value for money and greater local decision making in homeless services.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">A Protocol which sets outs arrangements and responsibilities for delegation of Section 10, Housing Act, 1988 funding between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Dublin City Council in relation to the provision of ongoing revenue funding for homeless accommodation and related service costs has already being put in place in the Dublin region beginning 1 January 2012 and will be rolled out nationally to the other regions at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_914">I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">The legal requirements applicable to the design and construction of new buildings, including dwellings, are specified in the second schedule to the Building Regulations.  Technical Guidance Documents are published by my Department to demonstrate how the legal requirements can be achieved in practice.  Compliance with the regulations is first and foremost the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building.  Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the local building control authority (Dublin City Council in the case of the development at Priory Hall) which is empowered to carry out inspections and to initiate enforcement proceedings where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">Notwithstanding the above, I am committed to strengthening the system to ensure stronger compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.  Local authorities and construction industry professionals in particular have a key role in this regard.  In this context, I announced, in July 2011, a number of measures to further strengthen the existing regulatory regime.  In broad terms the measures will involve:—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_917">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_918">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_919">(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_920">(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_921">(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The above reforms will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings following their introduction as early as possible in 2012.  Professionals who are engaged by developers will be required to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards and there is an urgent need for the construction professions to deliver high standards and professionalism in the construction field.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">The legal proceedings in relation to Priory Hall are continuing and it would be inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.  The overriding priority is to facilitate the return by residents to their homes as early as possible.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and I have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.</p>

         if he will disclose the percentage of the €12.8 million made available to Roscommon Integrated Development Company that has been given out in grant aid to companies in its catchment area; and the number of jobs created by companies funded by the RIDC.

          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_310">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_925">I presume the question refers to funding awarded to Roscommon Integrated Development Company under the Rural Development Programme.  Funding of €427m is available under Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  In line with European policy the programme is permitted a further two years, to the end of 2015, to realise approved commitments as expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">There are 35 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the individual group's local development strategy and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">The main aims and objectives of the Axes 3 and 4 of the RDP are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and to support the diversification of the rural economy.  The Programme is broken down into a series of measures under which support can be given by Groups to private individuals and community groups in order to achieve these aims.  Three measures provide direct support to projects that increase economic activity and three provide for a broader range of supports for the development of vibrant rural communities.  There is also a training and development measure and a measure to facilitate cooperation between RDP groups at both National and International level.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Roscommon Integrated Development Company (RIDC) is the company contracted by my Department to deliver Axes 3 and 4 of the RDP in Co Roscommon with an overall programme allocation of €12,838,021.00.  To date RIDC have spent €2,286,223.28 which accounts for 18% of their overall allocation.  This can be further broken down to support provided directly to projects that improve economic activity which amounts to €784,971.06 and projects to support community activity which to date amounts to €1,206,989.91.  There is a further €976,838.75 of commitments at an advanced stage of development in RIDC and €848,266.53 in the early stages of the project life cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">The programme in general does not provide 100% funding for such projects and beneficiaries are required to match the RDP funding with their own resources.  I accept that the current economic climate makes it difficult for entrepreneurs and small businesses to access the required level of matched funding and as a result groups, including RIDC, are finding it difficult to bring business start up projects to completion.  My Department is currently looking at ways to address areas where groups are having difficulty spending to ensure that the financial resources of the RDP are made available to as many rural dwellers as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">RIDC has supported the creation of 8.75 jobs and has also provided and will continue to provide significant financial resources to communities to develop facilities and amenities in their local areas.  I believe that community facilities not only promote social cohesion but also have a positive effect on the local rural economy and the provision of support for such facilities can, and does, make a significant contribution to overall economic development, particularly in rural areas.  In this context, I am confident that there is significant work being done by RIDC to ensure that the resources available under Axes 3 and 4 of the RDP are being made available to both individuals and community groups in County Roscommon.</p>

            <p eId="para_933">I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 197 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives.  The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.  The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over €800m in relation to water supply infrastructure.  This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">The Programme is based on an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services undertaken by each water services authority which were subsequently appraised by my Department.  In preparing their assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas.   The development of the Programme was strongly influenced by reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality, an assessment by Forfás of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs.  There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure.  The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The first phase of work on the independent assessment has been completed and has been published as part of a public consultation which will conclude on 24 February 2012.  The report set outs an outline transition plan for the establishment of Irish Water and following on from the consultation process, phase two of the independent assessment will set out a more detailed implementation plan.  This plan will take account of the need to ensure that this critical public service delivered efficiently during the transition and that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects.</p>

Irish Water would be established under its own statute by mid 2013 at which point ownership of assets would transfer from local authorities to Irish Water.

            <p eId="para_958">The units being advanced by NAMA will in general be provided through the Social Housing Leasing Initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply. The length of lease is determined by negotiation which may vary to reflect the circumstances of a particular case and the terms of the contractual agreement.  Generally leases entered into by housing authorities are for periods of ten to twenty years. The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.  Once a demand has been identified, NAMA will make contact with the relevant property owner/receiver to determine if the properties are still available and to discuss how these properties can be best utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">It is expected that the majority of suitable properties will be secured through leasing arrangements with the property owners/receivers.  Such arrangements will be determined on a case by case basis, and will involve either a local authority or an approved housing body as the prospective social housing provider depending on the particular circumstances in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The Housing Agency is working with housing authorities and NAMA to determine whether there is a social housing demand for the properties identified.  Where a demand is identified, this information will be provided to NAMA and arrangements will be made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">The Government is acutely conscious of the difficulties many households are facing in terms of mortgage arrears.  In October 2011 we published the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears and implementation of the report's recommendations is a key part of the Government's ongoing efforts to tackle mortgage difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">A Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, has been established to oversee and drive the overall implementation of the report's recommendations and to report regularly to the Economic Management Council and to Government on this.  In addition to the Department of Finance, the Steering Group includes the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Central Bank is also represented on the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">Separate working groups, established to progress the individual work streams of this broad work area, report to the overall Steering Group.  Significant progress has already been achieved across a number of the individual work areas.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_966">On "mortgage to rent", my Department has advanced work with a number of lenders and an approved housing body to pilot a scheme which will test the practicalities of such a measure in advance of wider implementation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_967">Regarding engagement with the banks, the Central Bank, as the regulator of credit institutions, has now received mortgage arrears resolution strategies and implementation plans from all mortgage lenders and these are being considered by the Central Bank.</p>

            <p eId="para_969">In addition, my Department had already taken steps to take account of the critical interface between the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and the social housing needs assessment process.  New provisions, introduced under the Social Housing Assessment Amendment Regulations introduced in July 2011, now enable an authority to carry out a needs assessment at any time after a mortgage has been deemed to be unsustainable and before repossession proceedings have been instituted. My Department does not hold information on the number of households on local authorities' waiting lists, or on the number of households that may, at some point in the future, apply for social housing. The number of households on waiting lists continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available onmy Department's website —<i>www.environ.ie</i> or on the Housing Agency’s website at <i>www.housing.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">This Government remains fully committed to supporting a number of area based and estate-wide regeneration projects under the National Regeneration Programme, including projects in Limerick city and elsewhere as well as estates and flat complexes in Dublin city.  Notwithstanding the constraints on capital budgets, my Department continues to prioritise funding for regeneration within the wider Social Housing Investment Programme.   As a proportion of the overall funding available for social housing, its relative importance rose from 11% in 2010 to almost 25% of the total programme in 2011, with an investment of some €118 million.  The regeneration programme, and ensuring that it is adequately resourced, remains a key element of the Government's housing policy for 2012 and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">In terms of the projects referred to, it is worth noting that the investment in the Limerick Regeneration, Ballymun, and the Inner City Flats and Former PPP Projects, accounted for 82% of the overall investment in regeneration last year at €96.2 million.  It is my intention to ensure that sufficient funding for my Department's social housing programme is made available in 2012 to deliver real progress in the case of each of these projects, having regard to their particular stage of development and in the context of the wider programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">My Department is currently liaising closely with relevant local authorities and agencies in determining the regeneration work programme for 2012. I intend to announce details of the capital allocations under the housing programme, including the allocations for regeneration, as soon as possible after this process has been concluded.</p>

            <p eId="para_991">Trade missions are a valuable support to Irish business in developing the exports which are crucial to our economic recovery.  This is particularly the case in countries where Government-to-Government contacts are a prerequisite for doing business.  My Department and our Embassy network work closely with the agencies and other Government Departments regarding the organisation of such missions.  A programme of Minister-led trade missions, organised in association with Enterprise Ireland to develop and expand Ireland's exports to existing and new markets abroad, is planned for next year.  The full range of destinations is still being finalised at this stage, and will most likely include a trade mission to China.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">I hope to visit China on an official visit at a mutually convenient date in 2012. This visit will provide an opportunity to build on the excellent bilateral relations that exist between our two countries; to have discussions with my opposite number in China on matters of mutual concern; to promote Irish interests; and to further enhance our political, trade, investment, education and tourism links with China.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">The Government attaches great importance to widening and deepening bilateral relations with China, including the political and economic relationships.  China is a key high-growth and high-potential market for Ireland under the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015.  The local market team, set up under the Strategy, includes all of the State Agencies present in China in addition to the Embassy in Beijing and the Consulate-General in Shanghai. The team is chaired by our Ambassador in Beijing and has been actively working to build on our growing economic and trade relationships with China.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">Ireland had a modest trade surplus with China in 2010.  Total merchandise trade between Ireland and China was worth almost €5.6 billion in 2010.  Trade in services during the same period was worth €2.7 billion.  Over 130 Irish companies now have a permanent business presence in China — an increase of 300% over the last five years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1006">The increase in the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 23% applies with effect from 1 January 2012.  In the case of continuous supplies of telecommunications services, electricity or gas, for which a bill is issued at least every three months, the rate of VAT that should be charged is the rate in force at the date of issue of the bill.  In all other cases of services to private individuals, the correct rate is the rate in force at the time of supply of the services.  The Revenue Commissioners have published a comprehensive information note about the application of the increase in the standard rate of VAT, whichis available on their website —<i>http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/leaflets/increase-in-standard-rate.html</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme which is administered by the Department of Social Protection.  I have been advised by that Department that the purpose of the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme is to provide short term income to eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists only with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments.  The capital element of the repayment is not taken into account in calculating the amount of supplement payable as it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.  The Scheme applies to mortgages held by EBS customers in the same manner as it applies to all other mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">I have also been informed that, under Social Welfare rules, the supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of the mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of Social Welfare appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than the minimum contribution because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic Social Welfare rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">Section 48 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides that a credit union may offer additional services to its members subject to these services appearing to the Central Bank of Ireland to be of mutual benefit to its members.  Each credit union is required to apply to the Registrar of Credit Unions for permission to provide the service.  However, in cases where a service appears to the Central Bank to generally involve no risk to the assets of the credit union or the funds of its members, the Minister for Finance has powers under Section 48(2) of the Act to make regulations under Section 182, exempting such a service from the requirement to have the separate prior approval of the Registrar.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">Statutory Instrument 838/2007</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">S.I. No. 838/2007 sets out the Credit Union Act 1997 (Exemption from Additional Services Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations 2007.  These regulations were made by the then Minister for Finance under Section 182, following consultations with the Registrar of Credit Unions.  They provide that individual credit unions can offer any service whereby a credit union member may arrange to have transferred to or from his or her account third party payments by way of electronic funds transfer or otherwise, without requiring the prior approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The Deputy asks if debit card transactions are exempted under this provision.  Debit card transactions cover a broad range of services.  The Registrar of Credit Unions advises that, while in general it may be reasonable to expect that debit card transactions would be third party electronic payments, it is not possible to be definitive on this for all circumstances.  In addition to the provision of such services being required to meet the requirements under S.I. No. 838/2007, credit unions are also required to meet all legislative and regulatory requirements under the Act including the provisions set out in Section 32(3) of the Act, relating to restrictions on withdrawal of members' savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">It is up to each credit union to ensure, in the context of the specific nature of the particular debit card transactions proposed, that any service provided to their members is in accordance with the provisions set out in the Credit Union Act 1997.  As set out in the Registry of Credit Unions' circular to all credit unions sent on the 27 January 2010, any credit union considering providing new card services (such as ATM cards, Debit Cards, Prepaid Debit Cards) to their members is required to contact the Registry of Credit Unions prior to developing any such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">The Irish Payment Services Organisation</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">The Irish Payment Services Organisation (IPSO) is a private representative industry body.  I understand that some, but not all, credit unions are associate members of IPSO.  The question of their membership is, however, a private issue and is not a matter for me as Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">The Final Report on the Strategy for Financial Inclusion which was published on my Department's website in March 2011 identified that the credit unions have the potential to play a key role in the provision of the basic payment account and in the promotion of financial inclusion in the future when they have the necessary technology, infrastructure and legislative framework to handle these services.  The Commission on Credit Unions  is examining the issue of "social lending" and how credit unions can play a role in providing financial services and products to meet the needs of low income groups and the unbanked.</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">The banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">In terms of monitoring the level of lending, both pillar banks provide my Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) with annual lending plans outlining in detail how they will achieve the lending target for SMEs.  Both pillar banks also produce quarterly reports which incorporate figures for sanctions and drawdowns by SMEs.  In addition, the pillar banks also provide monthly figures on balance sheet volumes, sanctioned facilities and regional and sectoral breakdowns of their SME lending.  The data contained in these reports is reviewed and analysed by the Department of Finance and the CRO to ensure that the banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.  In addition, the Economic Management Council will meet on a frequent basis with the pillar banks to discuss a range of issues in relation to SME business including the availability of credit to this important sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">As regards evaluating whether business sector borrowing requirements continue to be met, my Department commissioned an independent survey of demand for SME credit, the results of which will inform policy decisions in this area.  The report was based on responses from 1,506 SMEs and covered the period April-September 2011.  The survey showed that:</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Demand for Credit</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1033">36% of SMEs surveyed requested credit;</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">When the pending applications are excluded, the approval rate is 70%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The full report is available on the Department of Finance website.  A follow up survey will be conducted in April 2012 to cover the period from October 2011 to March 2012, with the outcome published shortly afterwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">In conjunction with the Minister for Small Business, Mr John Perry T.D., the Head of Banking Policy Division in my Department will be holding a series of regional meetings around the country to discuss access to bank credit with key local stakeholders.  The purpose of the meetings will be to allow the Minister to hear at first hand the views and experiences of local business representative groups, local bank representatives and state agencies on access to bank lending.  These will complement the information provided by the credit demand survey and better inform the design and implementation of future Government policies on credit to the SME sector.  The first of these meetings will be held on 3 February in Dundalk and Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">During 2009 it was determined that Anglo and INBS required additional capital.  A commitment was provided by the then Minister to Anglo and separately to INBS to provide capital of €8.3 billion and €2.7 billion, respectively.  This capital was provided on 31 March 2010.  In relation to Anglo, this €8.3 billion of capital was injected by way of a capital contribution.  This capital contribution is treated as equity capital for regulatory capital purposes.  In relation to INBS, a special investment share was acquired for €100 million in cash and a further €2.6 billion was subsequently injected by way of a capital contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">The Government did not pay for these capital contributions in Anglo and INBS with cash.  The Government effectively issued an IOU, in the form of promissory notes, to Anglo and INBS for €8.3 billion and €2.6 billion, respectively.  As the State had a debt to the institutions, it also had an associated interest charge.  This interest charge was set by reference to Government yields at the date of issue on 31 March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">Subsequently, it was determined that Anglo and INBS needed additional capital, which was again provided by increasing the 31 March 2010 promissory notes.  The final promissory note increase was on 31 December 2010 bringing the total promissory notes in Anglo and INBS to €30.6 billion.  See table below for the increases:</p>

Absent the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate on these promissory notes would have been 5.8%.  However, as a result of the insertion of the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate from 1 January 2013 is 8.2%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1171">As set out above, the total interest cost for the State for all tranches of the Anglo and Irish Nationwide promissory notes is €16.8 billion with annual repayments of €3.06 billion per annum until 2023, reducing thereafter until 2031 when the final repayment is made.  These annual repayments reduce over time as the various tranches of the promissory notes are repaid.  The final payment on the promissory notes of circa €0.1 billion will be made on 31 March 2031.  The total cost of the promissory notes including the principal amount and interest will be €47.4 billion over the life of the promissory notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">The Promissory Note acts as collateral under emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) loan (repo) agreements with the Central bank of Ireland (CBI).  The promissory note is, therefore funded by ELA, provided by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI).  This ELA is itself funded by the CBI through Intra-Eurosystem liabilities and any repayments of ELA are used to reduce this liability on the Central Bank's balance sheet.  Other than that there is no link between the Promissory Note and ELA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">As the repayment of the capital amount of the Promissory Note and the interest payments fall due the payments will provide cash to IBRC and thereby reduce the bank's requirement for ELA.  It is these repayments from the Government's Promissory Note IOU and flows from IBRC's banking assets that will repay ELA over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">As the Deputy is aware the Government is currently engaged in a process with our Troika partners with a view to re-engineering of the capital commitment to IBRC.  This review of the promissory note will consider a range of possible options to reduce the burden on the State including a reduction in the interest rate and consideration as to other possible sources of funding etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">I expect that the report of the technical group charged with looking at options will, in the first instance, form the basis of discussion with the Troika at senior level and from there will be considered by the Commission and the ECB in consultation with us.  If the discussions are successful, it could result in the replacement of these notes with an alternative instrument and a change in the repayment profile of the associated funding.  The government's approach in this matter is to vigorously pursue a resolution that is in Ireland's interests but to do so with the agreement of the ECB, the IMF and EC.</p>

         if he will confirm that the present value of payments to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation under the terms of the promissory note structure was €30.6 billion at date of issuance; if any change to the timetable for payments could potentially have implications for the solvency of that institution in the absence of additional capital provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1177">During 2009 it was determined that Anglo and INBS required additional capital.  A commitment was provided by the then Minister to Anglo and separately to INBS to provide capital of €8.3 billion and €2.7 billion, respectively.  This capital was provided on 31 March 2010.  In relation to Anglo, this €8.3 billion of capital was injected by way of a capital contribution.  This capital contribution is treated as equity capital for regulatory capital purposes.  In relation to INBS, a special investment share was acquired for €100 million in cash and a further €2.6 billion was subsequently injected by way of a capital contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">The Government did not pay for these capital contributions in Anglo and INBS with cash.  The Government effectively issued an IOU, in the form of promissory notes, to Anglo and INBS for €8.3 billion and €2.6 billion, respectively.  As the State had a debt to the institutions, it also had an associated interest charge.  This interest charge was set by reference to Government yields at the date of issue on 31 March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">Subsequently, it was determined that Anglo and INBS needed additional capital, which was again provided by increasing the 31 March 2010 promissory notes.  The final promissory note increase was on 31 December 2010 bringing the total promissory notes in Anglo and INBS to €30.6 billion.  See table below for the increases:</p>

These annual repayments reduce over time as the various tranches of the promissory notes are repaid.  The final payment on the promissory notes of circa €0.1 billion will be made on 31 March 2031.  The total cost of the promissory notes including the principal amount and interest will be €47.4 billion over the life of the promissory notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">A change in the payment schedule could potentially have implications for the solvency of IBRC.  If, for example, the principal and interest payments are changed, to avoid creating a potential solvency problem the interest rate after the deferred period may need to increase to make up for a potential capital shortfall.  The solvency of the institution is a prime consideration in the analysis of the options for re-engineering the Promissory Note.  This analysis is currently under way and the technical group, comprising of representatives of the Troika and the Irish authorities, will report on their findings.</p>

            <p eId="para_1300">One of the functions of the Central Bank of Ireland, similar to other central banks, is to grant Exceptional Liquidity Assistance to a credit institution when this is deemed necessary for financial stability purposes.  These amounts are published monthly.  ELA is one of the ways that the Central Bank has responded to the financial crisis.  This is distinct and separate from regular funding operations carried out for monetary policy implementation purposes through the ECB.  A loan provided to a credit institution under Exceptional Liquidity Assistance is granted against suitable collateral, where suitability is in line with unpublished criteria defined by the Central Bank.  As with procedures for ECB eligible collateral, appropriate haircuts/discounts are applied by the Central Bank to ensure that it does not suffer any loss in the event of default on the loan assistance.  I have provided formal comfort to the Central Bank such that any shortfall on the liquidation of this collateral will be made good.</p>

            <p eId="para_1302">I presume the Deputy is referring to business lending in this instance.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">I should stress that the targets are for approvals of credit, targets have not been imposed for drawdowns.  I would point out that the drawdown of funding is at the discretion of the borrower.  There are many factors affecting whether or not funding is drawn down, such as changes in market conditions or company restructuring.  The recent Mazars Survey of SME Lending, conducted on behalf of my Department, found that the most frequently cited reason for not availing of approved credit was "not needed at present time".</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">In terms of loan approvals with onerous conditions, if a borrower believes that the bank has attached terms and conditions to a loan such that the loan cannot be accepted then the borrower should ask for the decision to be appealed through the bank's appeals process.  If that appeal is unsuccessful, then the borrower can apply for review to the Credit Review Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">The Mazars Survey found that in 4% of approved application cases the respondent noted that the criteria/conditions attaching to the credit approval prevented them from availing of the sanctioned facility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1308">The Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed on 21 July 2011 to lengthen the maturity of future EFSF loans from 7.5 years to a minimum of 15 years and up to 30 years. The EFSF has since raised a mixture of long and short-term funds for Ireland including a 10 year loan of €3 billion. The weighted average original maturity of Ireland's €10 billion EFSF loans to date is 5.8 years. Short-term loans issued to date will be converted to long-term loans when market circumstances are appropriate, thereby extending the average life.   In October 2011, the EU Council of Ministers approved an EU Commission proposal to increase the maturity of individual tranches of lending to Ireland and Portugal from a minimum of 15 years to up to 30 years. In addition, EU Finance Ministers agreed that the average original maturity of the EFSM loans to these countries will be extended from 7.5 years to up to 12.5 years. Since this declaration the EFSM has issued Ireland with a thirty year loan of €1.5 billion.  The weighted average original maturity of Ireland's €15.4 billion EFSM loans to date is currently 10.2 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">The EFSF and EFSM fund their disbursements to Ireland by selling bonds and bills in the international capital markets. Notwithstanding the decision to extend the maturity of these loans, the terms and conditions of the individual disbursements to Ireland are, therefore, heavily dependent on the market conditions at the time of issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1311">I understand that in order to qualify as a craftsperson, an apprentice must be employed by a FÁS approved employer and complete all seven alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases of their apprenticeship, which is a minimum of four years (208 weeks) in duration from the date of registration, as well as achieving the qualifying standard throughout their apprenticeship.</p>

            <p eId="para_1313">In these difficult times for apprentices, FÁS has introduced a range of interventions to allow apprentices complete their apprenticeships without undermining the integrity of the apprenticeship system.  The current interventions to facilitate redundant apprentices include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1314">Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme(RAPS) — the RAPS allows redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job phases of their apprenticeship;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1315">Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments — applies to redundant apprentices that have successfully completed Phases 1 to Phase 6 of their apprenticeships but have not successfully completed Phase 7;</p>

            <p eId="para_1322">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">My Department's focus is on implementing the staffing arrangements for the coming school year and I do not propose to divert scarce staffing resources to deal with individual queries from Deputies.  My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year.  At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools. It is worth noting that we have 3,200 primary schools across Ireland. Over two thirds of those schools have more than 86 pupils and, as a result, have far higher average class sizes than all of the schools affected by this measure. For example a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for sixteen pupils. In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils. It is important to retain a sense of perspective and balance when discussing this matter and to realise the exceptionally favourable supports my Department will continue to provide for small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">For that reason, as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1358">The new simplified approach to the General Allocation Model of support for schools will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school.  Schools will also have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.  All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The overall objective of the reforms is to enable the teacher allocation process to operate more smoothly and efficiently within the new climate of fixed ceilings on teacher numbers.  The previous allocation model was based on enrolments in schools from 2003 and did not account for changes in pupil numbers in schools since that time.  The arrangements for the staffing allocation under the General Allocation Model (GAM) are specifically designed to facilitate GAM hours being clustered into full-time posts, either entirely within their own school or with a nearby neighbouring school.  These reforms are intended to be neutral in relation to the overall number of teaching posts allocated to schools.  As many of the changes are designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, it is inevitable that some schools that will lose posts and other schools will gain posts.  My Department will notify schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for the 2012-13 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1360">As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the need to ensure value for money in public expenditure is greater than ever.  In common with many other State-funded initiatives, the ICT in Schools programme has needed to re-evaluate its spending priorities to ensure it can continue to deliver essential services, notwithstanding an unavoidable reduction in the overall level of resources available.  The contracts for providing this service expire on 4 February and there are no plans to renew them.  Other options of providing access to maps are being examined within the context of available resources and value for money.  The Scoilnet service will continue to make other Geography-related digital resources available through its portal and the Professional Development Service for Teachers will continue to support teachers in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1362">Last December, I announced details of the education infrastructure plan for 2012.  Details of this plan are available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.  For the Deputy’s convenience, I have attached copies of the announced lists of schools under construction (60 schools) or anticipated to be progressed to construction in 2012 (56 schools).  I have also committed to announcing details of the five-year education infrastructure plan in the coming months.  This will outline when the major projects needed to cater for demographic growth will be completed.  Publication of the plan will also enhance the transparency and openness in the school building system.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b>
         the number of secondary schools covered by the national educational psychological service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_352">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1959">The Deputy will be aware that primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Any school that does not have a NEPS psychologist assigned to it may avail of the SCPA, whereby it can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with its assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts, will a student be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures students are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">In late 2010, NEPS outlined its approach in this regard in its publication, A Continuum of Support for Post-Primary Schools, which demonstrates the process from whole school interventions to more specialised and individual interventions.  These guidelines describe a graduated problem-solving model of assessment and intervention in schools and comprise three distinct school based processes.  The first process, Support for All, is a process of prevention, effective mainstream teaching and early identification.  This is available to all students and effectively meets the needs of most students.  The second process, School Support (for Some), is an assessment and intervention process which is directed to some students or groups of students who require some additional input.  The third process, School Support Plus (for a Few), is generally characterised by more intensive and individualised supports.  This level of intervention is for students with complex and/or enduring needs.  Relatively few students will need this level of support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">Since the production of these guidelines, NEPS psychologists have offered information seminars to all post-primary principals.  That process is nearing completion.  It has also had preparatory engagement with individual schools to embed the continuum in each school's practice.  The continuum model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration through intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need.  Currently, NEPS psychologists are assigned to some 615 recognised second level schools, or 93% of the sector's enrolment.  Services are also provided to an additional 38 schools through the psychological services of the City and County Dublin VECs.  The remaining 46 schools receive assessment services via the SCPA scheme that has been described.  NEPS psychologists process applications from all post-primary schools for reasonable accommodations in the leaving certificate examination for students with specific learning disabilities on behalf of State Examinations Commission.  It is estimated that applications in respect of over 4,500 pupils will be processed in this regard in the current academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">NEPS provides assistance to all schools that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.  The incidents themselves generally arise because of death through illness, road accident or sometimes suicide of a pupil or school staff member.  In the event of a critical incident within a school, NEPS is proactive in offering support to the school community in accordance with its needs.  During 2008, NEPS provided all schools with updated advisory material and support to assist them in preparing a critical incident management plan in order that they might better cope with the challenges such unexpected events can present.  At a more general level, NEPS psychologists provide a range of supports to school authorities and communities, including the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social emotional or behavioural difficulties.  NEPS actively promotes and supports the development of student support structures in schools, which includes the development of contact and collaboration with the relevant local HSE mental health agencies, including the Community Psychology Services and Mental Health Promotion Officers and the referral services of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1966">The decision to approve a job-sharing or career break application is a matter for the authorities of the employing school.  In schools that have over-quota teachers, applications for job-sharing and a career break may be considered by the authorities of the schools concerned in the normal way. However if the school is over its staffing allocation the established rules do not allow for the automatic replacement of teachers approved for job-share or career break arrangements. It is, of course, open to the school authority to apply to my Department for additional teaching hours by way of curricular concessions to cover part or all of the hours in respect of an approved job-sharer/career break teacher. Each such application is considered on its merits.  This position is no different from that pertaining in previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The criteria for the allocation of teaching posts at post-primary level, including the appeals mechanism, for the coming school year will be published shortly on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1972">The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative has been a pilot scheme involving approximately 550 schools that has operated since 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">The decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level. The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject. The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results. I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy. The €2.5 million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new national literacy and numeracy strategy. The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, which have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.  Given the priority of literacy and numeracy I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2000">The Government's Public Service Reform Plan, which was published last November, includes a commitment to establishing the scope to merge Forfás into the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">Since its establishment in 1994, Forfás has played a key role in providing policy advice, research and analysis on matters pertaining to enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation.  The agency also supports the work of various other bodies, such as the National Competitiveness Council, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation.  Forfás also carries out a range of shared services, including pensions administration, payroll operation, and accommodation services, on behalf of other agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2002">However, there is an imperative, at this point in time, to examine all aspects of public service delivery to determine how best to maximise the strengths available across the public sector, including in relation to enterprise policy formulation and implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2003">In this context, I have been considering how best the available resources in Forfás and my Department can be collectively harnessed in order to further enhance the formulation and implementation of national enterprise policy.   I have consulted with the Board of Forfás on this matter and I am currently considering their views.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">I have also asked the Secretary General of my Department to examine, with senior officials from Forfás, the practical implications which might arise from the integration of Forfás with my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2006">As part of the Employment Control Framework, which is the mechanism for the management of reduction of overall staff numbers, my Department has agreed staff numbers and annual operational ceilings with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. These relate to the staffing levels of my Department, its Offices and agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  The issue of staffing of their individual local offices is a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies themselves and not one in which I have any role or function.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland share an office in Dundalk.  The office services the North East Region which encompasses counties Louth, Monaghan, and Cavan.  The staff complement within Enterprise Ireland is six executives, and a Regional Director with responsibility for the Border Region and links to Northern Ireland.  IDA has a complement of three staff consisting of one Regional Executive, one Property Executive and one Executive Assistant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">All Enterprise Ireland clients based in Co. Louth are assigned a Development Advisor who works in a holistic way, across all the business functions of the company, to maximise sustainable exports and jobs in Ireland.  Through its Dundalk office, Enterprise Ireland provides assistance to entrepreneurs and businesses to develop and test business propositions which are at an early stage, ensuring there is a supportive environment for start-up companies and the provision of direct financial assistance for High Potential Start-Ups in Louth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">IDA Ireland continues to market the North East Region for new inward investment mainly through its Gateway of Dundalk, in line with the Government's National Spatial Strategy (NSS).  The agency works closely with its 21 client companies in Louth that currently employ approximately 1,500 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">The challenge of reducing staff numbers across the Public Sector means delivering the same high-quality services in an even more efficient manner.  However, I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being pursued by the two agencies will continue to bring about industrial development and employment opportunities for Co. Louth, as evidenced by the recent announcement by Prometric of the creation of more than 100 jobs at its Test Development Solutions HQ in Dundalk.  In addition, my Department will continue to work closely with both agencies to assist them in meeting the challenges they face in carrying out their mandates.</p>

Accordingly, there exists a comprehensive suite of employment rights and industrial relations law, and institutions, such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner Service, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, through which employment related disputes can be pursued and resolved.

The Registrar of Friendly Societies has a range of functions relating to friendly societies, industrial and provident societies and trade unions, dating back to the late nineteenth century.  The relevant legislation concerning trade unions is set down in the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1990.  Under that legislation trade unions may register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, subject to a range of obligations in relation to such registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">Principally, these include the following obligations:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2029">to register their rules and the titles and names of officers,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2030">to submit an annual return to the Registrar before the first day of June each year, specifying the receipts, funds, effects and expenditure of the trade union (which return to be accompanied by a copy of the audited accounts and a copy of the current rules),</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2032">to maintain a registered office and to notify the Registrar of any change in the registered office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">In addition to maintaining a file on each registered trade union and making it available for inspection, for her part the Registrar must:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2034">issue a certificate of registration to trade unions,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2035">register the returns mentioned above,</p>

            <p eId="para_2038">The Registrar also has a number of specific powers in the area of investigation/dispute resolution:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2039">to investigate complaints of discriminatory treatment against a non-contributor to a political fund.  The Registrar may make an order to remedy the breach, which is binding and conclusive, and not subject to appeal (section 3(2) of the Trade Union Act 1913).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2040">to investigate complaints under section 16(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 concerning the operation of secret ballots, following which the Registrar may instruct a trade union to comply with the secret ballot provisions of the Act (section 14(2)).  Where such instruction is disregarded the Registrar must inform the Minister, who may revoke the union's negotiating licence.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2041">to hear disputes referred to the Registrar under section 10 of the Trade Union Act, 1975 concerning the passing of resolutions approving amalgamations of trade unions.  Under this section, the Registrar may, at the request of the complainant or of the trade union, state a case for the opinion of the High Court on a question of law arising in the proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">The Registrar has no independent powers of investigation, and can only act where requested to do so on the specific areas mentioned above, or to refer a matter to the court in relation to wilful or fraudulent withholding of money.  This latter option is also available to "any person" acting on behalf of a trade union.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">The Registrar reports annually to the Minister in respect of the principal matters transacted in the Registry in respect of registered trade unions.  This report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

This information is available on the public file of each trade union, which includes details of registration, the rules of the trade union and its annual returns.  It is open to the Deputy to make enquiries to the Registry of Friendly Societies regarding any individual trade union.</p>

In line with these proposals, an independent assessor, who has been agreed by both sides, is examining the trading position of the company, including an assessment of the viability of continuing manufacturing in Kingscourt.  It was envisaged that the assessor would provide a report to both sides within a period of 2 weeks and that the parties would reconvene under the auspices of the LRC on 30 January to consider the implications of the assessor's report and other outstanding issues, including the question of severance terms for required redundancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">However, I understand that the assessor has sought additional time to complete the report and that the reconvened hearing will take place on 6th February next.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2105">There are a number of elements of the pension system which are in need of reform and there is a significant amount of work under way at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">We want to make the State pension more transparent and equitable, as well as affordable and sustainable.  The qualifying age for State pension has been increased to age 66 from 2014, 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The number of minimum paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension will increase from 260 to 520 in April 2012.  This has been legislated for since 1997.  Changes have been introduced in Budget 2012 to make the contribution band rates more equitable.  In addition, it is also proposed to move away from the current system of averaging contributions to determine the rate of pension to a more transparent system of calculating total contributions.  The proposed date for its introduction is 2020.  This will mean that individuals can qualify for a maximum pension with 30 years contributions and a minimum pension with 10 years paid contributions.  In conjunction with these changes, it is also planned to allow people to defer receipt of the State pension and make up shortfalls in contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2107">We want more people to save for their retirement and we want people to save more.  In fact, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to progressively achieve universal coverage, with a particular focus on lower-paid workers.  That is why we are currently working on the development of an auto-enrolment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2108">The complexity of the pensions system overall is another area we will be examining.  In particular, we want to make the whole system more transparent so that people can make informed decisions about their retirement planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">Given the extreme difficulties that most defined benefit schemes have faced in recent years, and indeed that many are still facing, we must recognise that changes to the current system are required if this type of provision is to survive.  Following detailed consideration of the issues involved and consultation process with stakeholders, the Government decided to introduce a number of changes with respect to defined benefit provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">These include: the introduction of a reformed and strengthened Funding Standard; a change in the way accrued pension benefits are revalued in order to ensure equity; a change in the priority order in which funds are disbursed when a scheme winds up to allow for a better return to members who have not yet retired.  In addition, the Pensions Board will be given powers to wind up schemes in certain limited circumstances.  Legislation to provide for these changes will be introduced in the coming months.  Initially however, the existing Funding Standard is being restored and this will give underfunded schemes 3 years in which to restore their funding levels to the current standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">In addition, the Pensions Board has published guidelines in relation to the sovereign annuity initiative.  This will enable potential providers to develop these products which will make it easier for pension schemes to invest in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2112">My Department is currently conducting a study of pension charges which was instigated because of concerns that pensions schemes and their members have in relation to the level of charges applied to their scheme and the lack of transparency around some of these charges.  This study will provide an initial benchmark on the level of pension charges for different forms of funded supplementary pension arrangements and will provide information in relation to the transparency of pensions charges.  These data have not been available to date so the study will provide valuable information to inform policy.  I will report on the findings and make recommendations to Government in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">Our agreement with the EU and IMF includes commitments to deliver full year savings of €940 million in tax relief in the broad pension tax relief area in the period to 2014.  The Minister for Finance has given a commitment to consult with stakeholders in relation to how this level of saving might be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">In the Programme for Government, we have committed to capping taxpayers' subsidies for all future pension schemes for politicians, and indeed for everybody, that deliver income in retirement of more than €60,000.  This reform will have an impact on high earners whether in the public or the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">The reform of public sector pensions is a key element of the wider public sector reform agenda.  Last September Minister Howlin published legislation which will see the introduction of a new single pension scheme for new entrants to the public sector.  This will provide a more straightforward and efficient structure for the management of public service pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">With regard to the pensions paid to politicians we want to ensure that no political pensions will be paid to sitting TDs.  So, our Programme for Government includes a commitment to restrict the payment of pensions to politicians so that in future a member can only qualify for a pension at State pension age upon leaving public life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">We have succeeded in achieving a society where people are living longer.  This is something to be welcomed but to support this we need a sustainable, fair and adequate pension system and this is something we are aiming for.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">With regard to further policy developments, I am currently considering options with regard to the oversight of future pension policy direction.</p>

            <p eId="para_2123">I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">At end of 2011 there were 2,928 and 2,977 recipients of rent supplement in counties Mayo and Donegal respectively.  Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 at end 2011, a 61% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012. These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">All new rent supplement applications are subject to these limits though no adjustments are required in respect of existing claims which are already within the new prescribed limits.  Existing claims will be reassessed using the new limits; most claims are reviewed every six months, or when an existing lease expires.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation. Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate. However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits in force.</p>
            <p eId="para_2129">The rent limit review will have no impact on the income of a person in receipt of rent supplement. The impact of the change in the rent limits will be on the amounts received by landlords who rent to rent supplement recipients.</p>

            <p eId="para_2142">Community Employment (CE) is a valuable resource in the provision of a range of services to communities.  However it is acknowledged that its effectiveness in terms of labour market progression is somewhat limited.  The report ‘Supports and Services for Unemployed Jobseeker's: Challenges and Opportunities in a Time of Recession', published in August 2011 by the National Economic and Social Council, was critical in terms of labour market progression.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">The budget for CE is some €315 million for 2012.  The massive increase in unemployment requires that as many places as possible are open to a broader range of Jobseeker's.  The reduction in training and employment grants was implemented in the context of the overarching need to ensure that all exchequer expenditure is targeted appropriately, which I consider to be a reasonable objective.  The total number of CE places available and the number of CE supervisors is not affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual schemes be completed by the end of March.  The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme.  As part of the review alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State agencies.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.  The outcome of the review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of this review at the end of March.  This guarantee will be funded by my Department from its 2012 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">In conclusion, I would like to assure you of my full appreciation of the value of CE schemes locally.  The focus now is on achieving improved outcomes both in terms of service provided at local level and job progression for CE participants themselves.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2157">The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2158">As part of a series of planned reforms to pensions a ‘total contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system. The current proposed date for its introduction is 2020. Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  This change reflects the potential that people now have to accumulate contributions as a result of the comprehensive nature of social insurance coverage which has been in place for 20 years, and the growth in the labour force over that period.  Accordingly, a total contributions requirement of 30 years' contributions and credited contributions for a maximum pension will be introduced.  The amount of credits which can be used to claim pension will be capped at 10 years.  Under the new approach, a minimum rate of State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable at one third (10/30ths) of the maximum rate, which will be 30/30ths and a person will accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30/30ths.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">I do not accept that total contributions will be detrimental to women.  In fact, the opposite is envisaged as this reform will replace the current averaging system which can create anomalies, particularly for women.  Under the current averaging system the average is calculated from the date a person enters into insurance until pension age whereas under the total contributions system a contribution has equal value regardless of at what stage in a person's working career it was made.  This can allow people to achieve a higher average contribution rate — and thus a higher level of pension — even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid.  This reform will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension and will assist people with gaps in their records.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">The scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  From April 2012, 520 contributions (10 years) will be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">I am currently considering the introduction of a system of homemaker's credits to replace the current disregard from 2012 and allow backdating to 1994 for the purpose of the averaging system that will continue until the total contributions system is introduced.  This means that people reaching pension age could have credits rather than disregards applied to their records to cover periods of care since 1994 (up to a maximum of 20 years) and would represent a significant improvement, particularly for women and those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.</p>

            <p eId="para_2167">I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">For the purposes of this reply, I am referring to the most recent proposed Special Protection Areas put forward by my Department in Donegal and Mayo, that is, those proposed for designation in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">In Donegal, some 260 valid informal, or Stage 1, objections were received from landowners and others concerning the proposed Special Protection Areas for the corncrake in the county. Sixteen objections were submitted in relation to proposed Special Protection Areas in Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">Decisions have yet to be made on the majority of these objections. However, no objection has been deemed to be successful to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">Staff from my Department have attended a number of public meetings in relation to these designations, and would have met many individual landowners to explain the designation process and to answer questions. However, my Department does not compile statistics on the numbers of such meetings held.</p>

            <p eId="para_2176">In April 2011, the Government announced a redress package for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on 53 raised bog special areas of conservation. The package offers qualifying turf cutters the option of a financial payment of €1,000 per year, index linked, over 15 years or, where feasible, relocation to non-designated bogs, where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of cut turf while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">My Department is currently processing almost 650 applications for compensation under this Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme. The majority of applications relate to the 29 raised bog special areas of conservation designated between 1997 and 1999 and for which the deadline for the receipt of applications has now passed. To date, 51 applicants have received payments under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">For the 24 sites designated up to 2002, the closing date for the receipt of applications was 29 February 2012 and, as such, more applications are expected to be received in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">If an individual has a legal interest in one of the 53 designated sites and had not been extracting turf in the relevant five year period, my Department is willing to examine the feasibility of relocating such interests to alternative non-designated bogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">Details of the number of applications received under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme and the number of payments made to date for Cos. Galway and Roscommon are set out in the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">There are no sites in Co. Leitrim affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">Since 1999 my Department has operated a Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme under which sites in designated bogs have been purchased by the Department at agreed rates. In May 2010, this scheme was closed to new applicants. Where applicants under the Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme have received a letter of offer but contracts have not been signed, my Department will be writing to applicants to outline their options under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2304">The land referred to by the Deputy is located in a Natural Heritage Area (NHA) designated in 2004. In 2010, the then Government decided that turf-cutting should come to an end on raised bog NHAs at the end of 2013. However, the current Programme for Government contains an undertaking to review the situation with regard to turf cutting on NHAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">On 15 April 2011, the Government made a number of decisions in relation to turf cutting in Ireland, including the putting in place of a compensation package for those who are required to cease cutting, the establishment of a Peatlands Council and the drawing up of a national strategy on peatland conservation and management. In the context of the national strategy, the position regarding raised bog NHAs, which are designated under national legislation, will be examined in advance of the 2014 cutting season in accordance with the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">My Department is giving priority to putting in place the compensation requirements in relation to the cessation of cutting on the 53 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation. In the circumstances, and in light of the decision to review the approach to these areas more generally, the issue of any further purchase of land/rights in NHA bogs, including the land referred to, is being kept under review.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2318">I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings, in particular for households that are reliant on the existing "free to air" analogue TV network.  However, I wish to make clear from the outset, that I have no plans to introduce waivers for persons to upgrade their television equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2319">All households solely reliant on the existing "free to air" analogue TV network will need to upgrade to digital TV by 24th October 2012, the date of analogue switch off, or they will lose access to television services.  TV households can choose to upgrade to digital TV by moving to a pay-TV service or by upgrading to Saorview, Ireland's national digital TV aerial network, which was launched by RTÉ on 26th May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">To upgrade to Saorview, TV households will need to purchase either a Saorview approved set top box to connect to their existing TV or a new Saorview digital TV.  In some cases, depending on the type of aerial, the orientation and age of the aerial, some TV households may need a new aerial or aerial adjustment.  The number of these is estimated to be around 20,000 TV households.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches and as competition increases in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the Saorview standard now coming on the market, as well as a range of suitable digital televisions.  In addition, experience from other European countries also shows that the availability of accurate and reliable information and the provision of practical assistance is the most effective approach towards assisting people in making the switch to digital television.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">In this regard, therefore, to overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign commenced in quarter four 2011.  There are a number of strands to the campaign including a national telephone helpline and a national advertising and public relations campaign.  The campaign will run up to the end of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">In conjunction with this, my Department has been working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  In this context, the expertise and local knowledge of the many voluntary and charity organisations around the country is of critical importance in ensuring the success of the switchover process.  On January 10th 2012 I signed an agreement with national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to develop and operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">The Wheel, in conjunction with voluntary and community organisations throughout the country, will roll out a countrywide Outreach Programme in April 2012, which will provide additional assistance and advice at community level to those who may find the move to digital TV difficult.  The aim of the Outreach Programme is to ensure that everybody is made aware of the switchover and that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once the national analogue TV service switches off on October 24th 2012.  A press release issued and is available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2326">The provision of electronic communications services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_2327">Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial semi-State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband access to every home and business in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2328">The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I convened last summer, has an important role to play in this regard.  The Taskforce, which I chair, also comprises Minister of State, Fergus O'Dowd, T.D., the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as targets, spectrum policy, private sector investment plans, and the removal of barriers (for example, local authority way leave processes) in order to facilitate investment.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  I intend to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_2331">Ireland's energy policy framework and specifically the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), contains a long-standing commitment to deliver 20% energy savings in 2020, with a more ambitious target of 33% for the public sector as part of a drive for Government to lead by example.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">The current NEEAP sets out actions for the period to 2020 to achieve the energy efficiency targets.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in annual energy cost reductions for the economy in 2020 whilst also reducing our CO2 emissions by approximately 5.7 million tonnes per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">To put this target in perspective, the national 20% energy saving target is equivalent to 32,000 GWh (gigawatt hours) saved by 2020.  The actions outlined in our second NEEAP, which I will shortly be bringing to Government, are projected to realise 33,500 GWh of energy savings in 2020.  While the latest projections are positive, a fundamental change in the energy sector, focused on the efficient management and correct use of energy, will be crucial to achieving our ambitious national targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">Moreover the EU Commission's proposed Energy Efficiency Directive, which is currently under negotiation, signals an intention to place a mandatory obligation scheme on all energy suppliers, with a fixed target for energy savings.  This will prove challenging, and with the possibility of binding targets to come, we need to be aware of the demands of future EU policy measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">My Department has committed funding of €76 million towards the Better Energy programme in 2012. Better Energy: Homes encourages homeowners to improve the energy performance of their homes through the installation of upgrade measures, including roof and wall insulation, boiler upgrades and heating controls.  Almost 48,000 homes benefited from energy efficiency upgrades in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty with a total of 20,388 being addressed in 2011.  The scheme is delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">Better Energy: Workplaces provides support for implementing a wide range of qualifying sustainable energy upgrading projects in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors.  In 2011 €11.5m was made available to the scheme, which supported 85 sustainable energy (mainly energy efficiency) investment projects of differing sizes and complexities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">In the public sector, the most significant cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance of new and existing buildings and facilities.  This will be a key focus of the new National Retrofit Programme, which will seek to raise financing from institutional investors for retrofit work in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">The Public Sector Programme of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), is the main delivery mechanism for energy efficiency actions by public sector bodies, which provides assessments and training to all public sector bodies and a grant programme to support energy efficiency measures.  The SEAI Energy in Business Programme supports efforts by business to improve energy efficiency and competitiveness through structured energy management.  It now involves the 150 largest business energy users and 2,000 small businesses.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2342">I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">The Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) was a series of 6 competitive tender schemes to support new renewable generation that were run from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s.  AER was subsequently replaced by the feed-in tariff scheme known as REFIT.  The AER schemes were all introduced prior to full electricity market liberalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">At the time that State Aid clearance was being sought from the European Commission for REFIT 1 in 2007, DG Competition inserted a clause in the terms and conditions of the scheme that generators were free to leave the scheme and join the open market, either by agreement with their supply company or in the event of disagreement, by serving 12 months notice.  Any generator that voluntarily leaves a support scheme in respect of a particular project will not be eligible to re-enter the support scheme at any later date in respect of that project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">It was also concluded by my Department that the concerns expressed by the European Commission about a continuing intervention in the market to deliver a public policy for any period longer than the participating generator required in REFIT should also be applied on a similar basis to the AER programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">As a result, my Department informed ESB Customer Supply (as the sole contracting party to the AER contracts) that nothing in the AER rules should be interpreted to preclude an undertaking from exiting an AER Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), subject to adequate protection being provided to ESB Customer Supply, and that ESB should terminate its AER PPAs with any AER Generator who requests such termination as soon as is reasonably practicable after the AER Generator notifies to ESB Customer Supply its intention to exit the AER programme; or, where ESB is the Intermediary of the relevant AER Generator under the Trading and Settlement Code, on the expiry of the minimum period prescribed under the Code in respect of revocation by the AER Generator of ESB's authority to act in that capacity; or within a period not exceeding 12 months from the receipt of notification from an AER generator of its decision to terminate an AER PPA, whichever event occurs first.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">Accordingly, under these provisions, an AER VI contracted renewable generators are allowed to leave their 15-year PPA contracts at any time subject to notification periods not exceeding 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">The AER VI competition included a provision whereby an applicant could opt for an accelerated payment in the first seven and a half years in the scheme, where the price applicable could be increased by 35% during that period and decreased by 35% in the following seven and a half years.  This was a feature of the competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">DG Competition, in insisting on an exit clause from REFIT, was seeking to ensure not to impose on renewable generation a requirement to participate in a scheme, when the renewable generators considered that they were capable of participating in the open market without further support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">The Department, in applying this condition to AER, did so in a similar spirit.  The AER VI projects that wish to leave may do so without condition, if they consider that they can now compete in the open market.  No conditions were applied that would seek to retain the AER VI projects in the scheme beyond when they considered they could compete in the open market.  An attempt to retrospectively reclaim payments from the PSO would most likely result in renewable generators remaining in the scheme, rather than competing in the open market and this was considered contrary to the policy DG Competition was trying to encourage.</p>

            <p eId="para_2406">I propose to take Questions Nos. 166, 167 and 168 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">I announced, in July 2011, a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations and which will make it mandatory for owners, builders and designers of buildings to provide evidence of compliance with building regulations, including fire safety requirements.  In broad terms the measures will involve:—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2408">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2409">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2410">(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2411">(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2412">(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">Mandatory certification, lodgement of drawings and improved inspection arrangements as outlined above are key reforms which, I believe, will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">The Local Government Efficiency Review Group recommended in its Report in July 2010 that a single building inspectorate service could be established on a regional basis to streamline the approach to the inspection of property.  The matter is being kept under review in the context of the above-mentioned actions being taken at Department and at Local Authority levels to further the development of the Building Control function.</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review by my Department, working in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).  The membership of BRAB is comprised of nominated representatives of key Construction Industry stakeholders (both private and public sectors).  Several local authority officials, including a senior official from Dublin City Council, currently serve on BRAB.</p>

            <p eId="para_2421">The Government's new housing policy statement, published in June 2011, will serve as a framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term. Based on a number of fundamental principles and goals that will form the foundation of a substantial reform programme, the new framework for housing policy responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector, taking account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market. The centrepiece of the approach is to chart a way forward for housing policy in Ireland by placing greater emphasis on choice, equity across housing tenures, and delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">In terms of the delivery of social housing, the policy statement clearly identifies that the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs — the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources. In light of the reduction in the social housing capital budget since 2008, it is not possible to return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.<b><i> </i></b>  Nevertheless, we are committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms including through increased provision of social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as RAS and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p>

            <p eId="para_2438">The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises, is a statutory function of the individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2440">The day to day cost of the provision of fire and emergency services, which is currently of the order of €270m, is met by local authorities, This pays for responding to fires and other emergency incidents, and the support services which are necessary to maintain 24 hour/ 365 emergency capability. In addition, related services such as fire prevention, fire safety inspections and major emergency management, are provided and funded by local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">In keeping with other adjustments to capital programmes, it has been necessary to reduce the fire service capital allocation of my Department for 2012. However, much has been accomplished in the past decade to strengthen the infrastructure of fire services in Ireland. The significant resources provided to local authorities under my Department's fire services capital programme have resulted in a quality fire and rescue infrastructure throughout the country. Most of our fire stations have full facilities, the appliance fleet is in very good shape and specialist equipment is generally regarded as top class.</p>
            <p eId="para_2442">Given the quality of the existing infrastructure, this year's reduction is not expected to impact on or disrupt the delivery of front line fire service delivery. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority for capital investment, given the current constraints on public finances.  In order to deliver cost efficiencies in line with recommendations of the Local Authority Efficiency Review Group, a programme is currently underway which involves fire authorities aggregating demand and inviting tenders for 17 fire appliances, following the development of an agreed national fire appliance specification.</p>

            <p eId="para_2444">As part of an overall approach to meeting Ireland's Kyoto Protocol target in the commitment period 2008-2012, the Government entered into an agreement with the World Bank in January 2007 to invest €20 million in two of their managed carbon funds by way of promissory notes, for the acquisition of carbon credits. €10m was invested in the BioCarbon Fund and €10m in the Carbon Fund for Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2445">Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency is the designated purchasing agent for the State. The cost of purchases is met through the Carbon Fund.  Each drawdown by the NTMA on the Carbon Fund is reimbursed to the Central Fund in the following year from my Department's Vote. In 2010, €4.1m was paid by NTMA from the Carbon Fund to cover drawdown demands from the World Bank. This €4.1m was reimbursed from subhead D4 of my Department's Vote in 2011.  In 2011, a payment of €1,930,386 was made by NTMA to the World Bank in respect of the BioCarbon Fund. This amount will be refunded from my Department's Vote in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">While the overall level of financial commitment to the World Bank Funds is fixed at €20m, the timing and actual amount of the annual drawdowns are not. The quantum and timing of drawdowns are agreed by the participants at the annual general meetings of the Funds and depend, in the main, on progress made with the various projects, which make up the investment portfolio.</p>

            <p eId="para_2453">I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2454">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2455">The Act places the household charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2456">The definition of "residential property" in section 2(1) is relevant when considering whether a residential property that is not used or lived in is liable to the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2457">There are a number of indicators as to what makes a house suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining any liability to the household charge. The indicators include the structure of the house, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the Act. The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability to the household charge on the liability date (1 January 2012) and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charge in respect of that property by the due date, 31 March 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">Under section 4(4) of the Act, an owner of a residential property is entitled to a waiver from payment of a household charge, where the residential property is situated in an unfinished estate which is specified in a list prescribed for the purposes of the section.  The Schedule in the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 contains the list of developments prescribed for the purposes of the unfinished estates waiver. Priory Hall, Hole in the Wall, Dublin 13, is included in this Schedule.</p>

            <p eId="para_2464">Under section 5(1) of the Act, the owner of a residential property, who on a liability date, is liable to pay a household charge to a relevant local authority, or who is entitled to a waiver from payment of a household charge under section 4(4), must make and provide to the relevant local authority a declaration stating that he or she is so liable or so entitled, as the case may be.   Under section 5(2) of the Act, the declaration must, in the case of a person who is liable to pay a household charge, be accompanied by payment of the household charge in respect of the property concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2465">The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability for the household charge in the first instance and there is no obligation on local authorities to issue notifications or invoices regarding the household charge under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2466">Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the household charge and the liability and payment dates. The Local Government Management Agency, which is administering the household charge on a shared services/agency basis on behalf of county and city councils, and local authorities have commenced a national information campaign to advise people of the household charge and their responsibilities in relation to payment of the charge.  A similar and successful advertising and information campaign was undertaken in the context of the €200 charge on non-principal private residences on its introduction in 2009 with further advertising taking place each year since. It is also intended that a household charge information leaflet will be issued shortly to residential properties in the State.  I am confident that those liable to the household charge will be aware of their obligation to discharge their liability for the charge by 31 March 2012 and thereby avoid any late payment fees or late payment interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_2481">My Department has provided financial support for a number of waste enforcement initiatives related to illegal or unregulated landfill sites under a European Court of Justice ruling in case ECJ C494/01 in order to give effect to the Court judgment.  This has included illegal sites which were unregulated at the time of the judgment, a number of local authority owned landfills which were operating at the time of the judgement in April 2005 without a waste licence (and which have since been regulated) and also areas where offset has been provided for habitat loss or where waste has or had to be removed, as well as unregulated end of life vehicle sites.  The information requested in relation to the annual breakdown of the expenditure is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  Future costs will be dependent of the outcome of a number of tendering processes as work is progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2483">In its Water Quality 2007-2009 Report, the Environmental Protection Agency noted the presence of microbial contamination arising from the entry of faecal matter to Ireland's waters and stated that one of the main sources of microbial pathogens was on-site waste water treatment systems, including septic tanks. The report states that while the proportion of monitoring points with faecal coliform detections is high, it not only reflects the impact of human activities, but also the vulnerable nature of groundwater in some parts of the country.  Groundwater is a source of drinking water for many people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2484">The EPA's Urban Waste Water Discharges in Ireland for Population Equivalents Greater than 500 Persons: A Report for the Years 2006 and 2007 stated that at the start of 2008, waste water from 112 locations was being discharged with either no treatment or basic treatment, and in most cases was discharging to estuarine or coastal waters. However, a number of major waste water treatment plants which discharge to tidal waters came into operation during the period 2007-2009 and the level of untreated discharges is expected to decrease further as additional treatment plants come into operation in the coming years.  Discharges from local authority waste water treatment plants are subject to authorisation by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007, a copy of which are available in the Oireachtas library.  A water services authority which commits an offence under these Regulations is liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €5,000, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €500,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2485">Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on owners to ensure that their treatment systems do not cause a risk to human health or the environment or a nuisance through odours. Offences committed under section 70 of the 2007 Act carry potential fines on summary conviction of up to €5,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months, or both, or on conviction on indictment, fines up to €15 million or imprisonment for up to 5 years or both.</p>
            <p eId="para_2486">The maximum penalty for an individual who commits an offence under the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, which passed all stages in the Oireachtas yesterday, is a fine of €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2487">On my appointment as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I was briefed by my Department on the urgency of implementing the necessary legislation to comply with the ECJ ruling of October 2009 and the consequential fines that would be imposed on the State by failing to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_2489">A key principle underlying my Department's community programmes is to enable communities themselves to identify and address social and economic needs and problems in their own areas. There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat, and an adherence to the values of local participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2490">My Department is responsible for a range of programmes to support communities.  These include the:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2491">1. Local and Community Development Programme, which tackles poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2492">2. Supports for the Community and Voluntary Sector, which foster vibrant, sustainable and inclusive communities through a range of Programmes;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2493">3. Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 which implements measures to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2494">4. RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development), a Government initiative which targets the most disadvantaged urban areas and provincial towns in the country;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2495">5. Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund, which assists small scale, local, non-profit environmental projects aimed at increasing environmental awareness and developing sustainable communities; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2496">6. Social Inclusion Units — located in 16 Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">Local and Community Development Programme</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">The objective of the Local and Community Development Programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities. The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies. Funding of €55.157m has been provided under the Programme for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">I am confident that the 2012 budget allocation will allow for the continuation of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities and will allow for the key, essential, front-line services delivered through the Programme to be maintained for 2012. I am also confident that the adjustment to the Programme has been structured to protect front-line services and supports at the expense of administration, overheads and ancillary costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">This Scheme is to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. Priority is to be given under this Scheme to supporting national organisations which provide direct services to disadvantaged target groups. Under The scheme to support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector some €4m is allocated to 64 national organisations per annum for core costs (salaries and related overheads). This is a two and a half year funding scheme and will not be open for application until 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">Community and Voluntary Forums In line with the commitment in the White Paper Supporting Voluntary Activity   funding is provided to local authorities to support the operation of the Community and Voluntary Fora established as part of the County/City Development Board process. €600,000 is also available to disburse between 34 Community and Voluntary Fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_2503">Seniors Alert Scheme</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">My Department manages the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages and assists the community's support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of people over 65 years of age. The Scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. Grant support is available towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alert systems (pendant alarms) and other items to improve the safety and security of the home (including monitored smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, internal emergency lighting and external security lighting).</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">Rural Development Programme</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">My Department also funds the LEADER elements (Axes 3 and 4) of the Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-2013. LEADER funding under this Programme supports improvements to the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification and development of the rural economy. Of the total €427 million public funding available, almost €235 million will come from the European Union. The LEADER elements of the Programme are being implemented at a local level by 35 Local Action Groups throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2535">Ambient air quality monitoring and assessment in Ireland is carried out in accordance with the requirements of Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, also known as the CAFE Directive.  The CAFE Directive consolidated and replaced the earlier Air Quality Framework Directive and first three so-called "daughter" directives, and has been transposed into national legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011. The Directive requires that the country is divided into zones for the purposes of the assessment and management of air quality and also sets limit values for the following pollutants:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2536">Sulphur Dioxide (SO2),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2537">Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2538">Particulate Matter (PM10  and PM2.5),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2539">Lead,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2540">Benzene,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2541">Carbon Monoxide (CO), and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2542">Ground-Level Ozone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">In addition, Directive 2004/107/EC, the fourth ‘daughter' directive under the Air Quality Framework Directive, which was not consolidated within the CAFE Directive, remains in effect. This Directive has been transposed into national legislation by the Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury, Nickel and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ambient Air Regulations 2009, which specify further monitoring requirements as well as limit or target values for arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic hydrocarbons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of Irish air quality. The EPA continually monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of air quality monitoring stations located around the country, and reports the results of the air quality monitoring on its website: <i>http://www.epa.ie/what we do/monitoring/air/data/</i>.  My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent of which, Air Quality in Ireland 2010 — Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in September 2010.  The report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2010 based on data from a network of 28 monitoring stations.  In addition, there were a further 11 monitoring stations measuring black smoke operated by local authorities during 2010.  The Report confirmed that air quality in Ireland continues to be and remains among the best in Europe. In 2010, measured values for all of the above-mentioned pollutants were below the limit and target values set out in the CAFE Directive and the Fourth Daughter Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">The Report further noted that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels and particulates of nitrogen dioxide have remained relatively static since 2002.  While NO2 levels are low in rural areas, they remain elevated at certain locations in Dublin and Cork, albeit below the 2010 limit value.  As road traffic is the primary source of NO2, elevated levels of NO2 are most notable at road traffic influenced sites. Technological advances set down by EU emission standards may in future lead to lower NO2 emissions from individual cars but this technology will take time to impact on current levels. NO2 levels can also be reduced through reducing travel demand by car, emphasising the importance of more sustainable modes of transport such as cycling, walking and public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">Domestic solid fuel use is the other main source of particulate matter and specifically impacts air quality in areas where the sale of bituminous coal is permitted.  As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities, where sale of bituminous (or "smoky") coal is banned.  As such, the choice households make in domestic heating fuel can have a major impact on local air quality.  My Department meets regularly with the EPA and key local authorities to ensure the ongoing roll-out and effective enforcement of the smoky coal ban.</p>

            <p eId="para_2549">My Department provides funding towards group water schemes by way of annual block grant allocations to local authorities under the Department's Rural Water Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">Responsibility for the administration of this programme has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual group scheme proposals for funding and advancement under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocation provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">The 2012 allocation for the Rural Water Programme is €40 million. My Department is currently considering the proposals received from local authorities towards the end of last month for funding under the Programme in 2012. Decisions on the funding to be provided to the local authorities, having regard to the proposals submitted, will be made as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2553">My Department's involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2554">In order to determine the capital allocations for 2012, my Department requested local authorities to submit details of their funding requirements under the grant schemes by 20 January, 2012. The information received is being examined at present with a view to determining this year's capital allocations to local authorities. I intend to announce details of the allocations as soon as possible after the publication of the 2012 Revised Estimates for Public Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2555">While a number of authorities have advised my Department of constraints on their Revenue budgets, local authorities collectively have indicated that €18.649m is being made available in 2012. In order to ease the pressure on Revenue budgets, my Department advised local authorities that Internal Capital Receipts from the sale of local authority houses and properties could be used to augment the available revenue funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_2651">I have previously stated my intention to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons.  Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  The arrangements for membership of the Committees will be changed and a link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.  As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the Inspector of Prison's role which I believe will greatly enhance his independent oversight of the prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2652">Under these proposed new arrangements, Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector of Prisons on issues they may wish to bring to his attention.

            <p eId="para_2655">The most recently available figures (31 December 2011) indicate that approximately 5600 non-EEA students  were registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau on that date having arrived in Ireland since before 1 January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2656">The ‘New Immigration Regime for Full Time Non-EEA Students' was published in September 2010 and has been in operation since 1 January 2011.  It introduced maximum periods for residence in the State for non-EEA nationals on a student permission.  Students pursuing degree programmes may reside for a maximum period of seven years and students on language or non-degree programmes may reside for a maximum of three years.  It is, of course, possible for a language and non-degree programme student to transfer to the degree programme stream.  However, the maximum period any foreign national may reside in the State on a student permission is seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2657">At the commencement of the New Regime, a range of transitional arrangements where implemented for those students who had been resident in Ireland in excess of seven years and for those students on language or non-degree programmes who had been resident for more than three years—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2658">All students were permitted to complete any course they had commenced prior to the introduction of the new rules.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2659">Language and non-degree programme students who had sufficient time to undertake and complete a degree programme  have been permitted to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2660">Students who finish an honours degree course (or higher) are permitted to remain in Ireland for a further year during which they can work, engage in internship or, if they wish to stay for a longer period, seek an employment permit,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2661">As a special concession "timed-out" students were entitled to a six month extension of their immigration permission to allow those students to address their immigration status in the State.  During this six month concession period, "timed out students" were permitted to work full time and to apply for an employment permit or green card without having to return to their country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">The availability of this six month concession expired on 30 September 2011.  However, a further final 3 month extension is now available to relevant students, whose permission expires between 1 January and 31 March 2011 in order to permit them to finalise their status in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2663">While I am keeping the situation under review, I am satisfied that significant measures have been put in place to ensure that non-EEA students resident in Ireland prior to 1 January 2011 have been treated fairly with the introduction of the new arrangements.  The transitional measures provide ample opportunity for students to seek an alternative permission to be in the State.</p>

One such condition is that I must be satisfied that the applicant is of good character.  It would be inappropriate for me to indicate what might or might not specifically constitute good character in this context as to do so could be interpreted as a fettering of the absolute discretion given to the Minister in the Act. I can say, however, that I exercise my discretion based on an evaluation of the overall case presented to me.</p>

Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, had to be completed before any payment can issue.  These checks are currently being carried out in respect of the 2011 Scheme year and once successfully completed payment will issue.  The specific query appears to relate to the traditional hay meadow measure which is part of the plan of the person named.  To ensure compliance with scheme terms and conditions on the particular parcel of land, it is necessary to follow traditional grazing practices.  Accordingly it may not be grazed from 1 April until after the hay is cut each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2699">There has been significant public investment in the sheep sector in recent years. Key supports for this sector include €7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme and €54 million for the three-year Grassland Sheep Scheme which commenced in 2010.  The grassland Sheep Scheme is proving to be a valuable support mechanism in terms of improving income and confidence in the sector.  The sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme, which is one of five Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) was re-opened to applications last December and the first tranche will close on 29 February this year.<i/> This Scheme will enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  All of the supports I have outlined have provided a significant incentive to farmers to maintain their production levels, which is vital for the future of a viable sheep industry in Ireland.  In addition, Bord Bia will also spend over €1.1 million this year on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad and Teagasc has allocated almost €1.5 million for sheep research for 2011. </p>
            <p eId="para_2700">On the question of providing funding towards the establishment of sheep discussion groups, the realities of the public finances mean that difficult choices have to be made when it comes to allocating scarce Exchequer resources.  In common with all other Ministers, I am faced with a number of financial challenges at present and my approach to determining spending priorities is always informed by the need to ensure that scarce public resources are utilised to best effect to facilitate the development of the agri-food industry as a whole, taking into account all the sectors it entails.  While unfortunately funding is not available at present for sheep discussion groups, I continue to urge all sheep farmers to avail of the extremely valuable information emerging from Teagasc and Sheep Ireland and to participate where possible in discussion groups or other collaborative initiatives which can assist farmers in making their enterprises more efficient and in improving margins.</p>

         the new terms and conditions for the disadvantaged areas scheme 2012. 
        [5958/12]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_447">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2789">It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area.  From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland's Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission.  In this regard, therefore, the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget have been submitted to Brussels; the Commission's response is expected shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from €220 million to €190 million and, in order to achieve the €30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012.  This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable — 34 hectares.  The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">It is proposed that eligible applicants in 2012 must have met (a) a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per hectare in 2011 (equivalent to 2 ewes per hectare) and (b) 0.15 livestock units per hectare in 2012.  However, in recognition of the environmental objectives of the Scheme, specific provisions will be made for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure.  If the proposals are accepted, all applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process. It is also intended that provision will be made for new entrants to farming.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">It is proposed to continue with the minimum stocking density of 0.15 lu/ha in respect of 2012.  With a view to focusing the aid to those farmers, who make the most significant contribution to the rural economy and to the environment in general, it is proposed that the calculation of the stocking density will be based on (a) a retention period of 6 months where the stocking density on the holding has to be equal to or greater than 0.15 lu/ha and (b) the stocking density calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2794">With the intention of targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, it is proposed that digressive payments will apply for farmers whose holdings consist of land situated in both Disadvantaged Areas and non-Disadvantaged Areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2795">Any analysis of the Scheme must take into account the impact of the various enterprises on the local economy. As is clearly evident, the main benefits arise from (i) beef rearing, (ii) dairying and (iii) sheep breeding enterprises.  There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants' contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2796">It is also proposed to exclude land situated more than 80 kilometres from a farmer's holding from aid under the Scheme.  This exclusion will be confined to applicants, whose main holding is situated in a non-Disadvantaged Area, and who declares land situated more than 80 kilometres from the main holding.  It is contended that the local impact of the farming of those lands situated in the Disadvantaged Areas is marginal.</p>

            <p eId="para_2798">The policy in relation to the distribution of mackerel in the polyvalent sector was reviewed and finalised in early 2010 and included a detailed public consultation process.  Following  that process,  a fishery for Mackerel for small fishing vessels was established by the Minister whereby an amount of mackerel is available to  polyvalent vessels under 18m in length.  The quantity of mackerel is decided following consultation with industry representatives.  The limit is 2 tonnes per month for the month of  February.  This amount may  be increased and was set at 4 tonnes for the spring and most of the summer during 2011.     In relation to herring, last year I asked the fishing industry representatives to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries. In response to my notification of the review, a number of proposals were received from industry including the Inver traditional fishermen's group.  Taking account of the diverse views expressed, I have published a proposed policy and  sought the views of industry on the proposal.  I am meeting Industry representatives and those who made submissions next Monday 6 February to hear directly views on the draft proposals circulated.  Before making a final decision on the management arrangements for the 2012 herring fisheries, I will review all submissions made and the views expressed at the meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">Quota for herring and mackerel is only available, subject to management arrangements in place,  to Irish  licensed and registered fishing vessels.  The registration and licensing of sea fishing vessels is governed by EU Regulation and the function is administered independently of the Minister by the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats.</p>

            <p eId="para_2801">I understand that Fisheries Bye-Law No. 7 of 16 February 1857 remains in force in relation to Inver bay.  Bye-Law No. 7 is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and natural Resources.  While Bye-Law No. 7 prohibits trawling within Inver Bay within a straight line from the Bian Rock to Doorin Point it is effectively unenforceable given the very low level of penalty involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">Any vessel trawling within this area is breaching the Bye Law.  I am aware that local pot fishermen are reported on occasion to have had their gear towed away by trawlers operating in the Bay.  In my view, the loss of or damage to gear caused by these trawlers is most effectively dealt with as a civil matter between the parties involved.  In essence the issue arising here is a matter of access to inshore waters by larger fishing vessels using particular types of fishing gear and if any changes to the current arrangements were to be considered this would have to be examined on a national basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2887">It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland's Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. In this regard, therefore, the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget have been submitted to Brussels; the Commission's response is expected shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2888">The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from €220 million to €190 million and, in order to achieve the €30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2889">It is proposed that eligible applicants in 2012 must have met (a) a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per hectare in 2011 (equivalent to 2 ewes per hectare) and (b) 0.15 livestock units per hectare in 2012. However, in recognition of the environmental objectives of the Scheme, specific provisions will be made for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure. If the proposals are accepted, all applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process. It is also intended that provision will be made for new entrants to farming.</p>

            <p eId="para_2891">An application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on the 16th of May 2011.  This application was selected for a Cross Compliance inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2892">During the course of the inspection breaches were recorded relating to Bovine Passports, failure to notify movements to the Cattle Movement and Monitoring System and an inadequately maintained herd register. As some of these breaches were repeat offences from a similar inspection in 2010, a 15% penalty was recorded and was subsequently deducted from his direct payments in 2011. The person named was informed of this decision on the 12th of January 2012 and of his right to seek a review. He was also informed of his right to appeal the outcome of a review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals office. To date, no such review request has been submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and has received 75% payment in respect of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2894">Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, had to be completed before any payment could issue.  The cross compliance penalty, in this case 5%, must be applied and payment for the remaining 25%, less the penalty will issue at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          the consultation process entered into internally within his Department or externally with the public with regard to SI 151/2009 (Forestry Act 1988); the rationale behind this statutory instrument; and the reason it was deemed necessary to introduce by-laws and a permit for individuals entering Coillte property.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2896">The Forestry Act 1988 (Section 37) (Coillte Teoranta) By-laws 2009 [Statutory Instrument No. 151 of 2009] was made on foot of a request from Coillte under Section 37 of the Forestry Act 1988. Coillte requested the making of the bye-laws to assist the company in controlling unauthorised activities on Coillte property, examples of which included indiscriminate illegal dumping of domestic and commercial waste, damage to security barriers and property and inappropriate operation of All Terrain Vehicles such as quad bikes and motorbike scrambling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">In relation to consultation, while Coillte consulted with the Garda Síochána on the matter, there was no formal consultation with the public as such. However, the By-Laws were introduced following several complaints from members of the public with regard to anti-social behaviour on Coillte property and in particular in areas frequented by members of the public who enjoy the amenity afforded under Coillte's Open Forest Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">It should be noted it has been the practice of the company and its predecessor since the 1970s to operate an Open Forest Policy, whereby the general public are permitted and welcome to use forest lands for non-commercial, informal and recreational purposes.  I am advised that formal permission is not required in such cases but access is subject to visitors taking due care for their safety, having consideration for other forest users and respecting the nature of Coillte's commercial operations.  In addition to activities allowed under the Open Forest policy, Coillte also permits other activities such as car rallying, pony trekking and game bird and deer shooting under licence, enabling the company to control these activities and ensure that there is no conflict between them and other forest uses. In 2004 Coillte undertook a major review of its recreation policy in consultation with stakeholders, including NGOs, Local Authorities, state agencies, etc, 170 of whom responded to an invitation to contribute to the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">In addition to the recreational uses described, many unauthorised activities also occur on Coillte lands causing environmental damage, risk of death/injury etc., and as a result, Coillte requested the making of the by-laws to assist the company in controlling such unauthorised activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">I am advised that the by-laws do not encroach on any existing rights and apply only to those Coillte lands (i.e. lands owned, managed or used by Coillte) on which a Notice of Application of By-Laws has been posted in a visible location where the public might reasonably gain entrance. In introducing the by-laws, Coillte identified those activities causing the company the greatest problems and have made provision for some activities to be banned, others to be restricted and still others to be undertaken only under licence.  The range of activities banned, restricted or undertaken only under licence on Coillte property include unauthorised entry; consumption of alcohol; dumping; graffiti; erection of notices and posters; vehicular access and use; control of animals; public nuisance; protection of watercourses; temporary dwellings; use of firearms and the lighting of fires.</p>

            <p eId="para_2926">As the Deputy may be aware a number of children-focused services from various sectors, including the National Educational Welfare Board, have been brought together under my responsibility since June 2011 to facilitate Government's objective to deliver an integrated and consistent approach in the development of policy and services aimed at children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2927">With reference to the outcome of the matters investigated in Special Report No. 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in 2007, I wish to refer the Deputy to the findings of the Report which found that the National Educational Welfare Board had incurred nugatory expenditure of approximately €470,000 and professional fees of €228,000 investigating the matter up to September 2007.  With regard to the civil case referenced by the Deputy, I am advised by the Board that the matter has not yet concluded and so it would not be appropriate to comment on the specifics of the case or the legal fees incurred at this point in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2928">In relation to the incremental salary payment referred to, in April 2004, the former IT Manager's salary was increased from point 4 of the Assistant Principal Officer scale to the 2nd Long Service Increments (There are six points on the scale plus two Long Service Increments). This had the effect of increasing his salary from €61,959 to €69,460. In 2008 the Department of Education and Skills informed the Public Accounts Committee that no sanction was issued from the Department in relation to this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2929">The Department of Education and Skills (being the Department with responsibility for the NEWB at the time of aforementioned expenditure) in view of its key role in the ongoing engagement with bodies under its aegis to ensure continuing compliance with standards in the development and implementation by bodies of their own internal governance and financial systems, established ongoing monitoring and reporting structures with the NEWB whereby all income and expenditure activity was reported to the Department on a quarterly basis.  Procedures were also established by the Department of Education and Skills at that time whereby applications for pay alterations could be submitted by the Board in respect of individuals where such consideration was warranted and any sanctions on pay alterations were approved through the Department of Finance and conveyed to the Board in written format.</p>
            <p eId="para_2930">Furthermore, the Board, in keeping with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies established internal corporate governance structures which are reviewed and developed on an ongoing basis. These structures include an internal audit function, structured and comprehensive reporting to the Board by the CEO on all aspects of the work of the Board including detailed monthly financial information and approval process for Board and management.</p>
            <p eId="para_2931">My Department continues to monitor the Board's compliance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. The Board is fully aware of its responsibility with regard to its oversight role in the disbursement of moneys with the Chief Executive Officer being the person accountable to the Board and to the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2941">It was a specific condition of the 2010 Voluntary Early Retirement scheme that persons availing of the scheme would not be eligible for re-employment in the public health sector or in the wider public service or in a body wholly or mainly funded from public moneys.  The same prohibition on re-employment applied under the 2010 Voluntary Redundancy scheme also, except that the prohibition is for a period of 7 years, after which time any re-employment will require the approval of the Minister for Finance.  These provisions also apply in the case of re-engagement on a contract for service which would include employment through an agency engaged in the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2942">However, there is currently no voluntary redundancy or voluntary early retirement scheme available in the public health sector.  Therefore, no specific re-employment restrictions apply to persons retiring before the end of the ‘grace period' which expires on 29 February 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2952">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2953">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.</p>

Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3006">Road safety legislation requires that car seat belts must be fitted to all forward facing seats and must be worn.  In addition, the RSA's Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 identifies a number of specific targets groups in order to improve seatbelt wearing rates in the adult, primary school and secondary school-going populations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3007">In assessing the success of these initiatives, a 2011 study has revealed an increase in rear seatbelt wearing rates among each of these groups, with adult rates increasing from 79% in 2009 to 90%; primary school students increasing from 80% to 94%; and secondary school students increasing from 83% to 93%. The RSA is continuing to influence attitudes and behaviours toward seatbelt usage through a number of educational programmes and mediums.</p>
            <p eId="para_3008">Although compliance with safety belt wearing requirements in Ireland is high and we are among the top EU best-practice countries as regards safety belt wearing rates, incidences in which safety belts are not worn are still over-represented in collision data. I understand that the RSA will be including increased safety belt wearing rate targets in the new Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 which is currently being prepared.</p>
