            <p eId="para_3">Having regard to the confidential nature of the work of the National Security Committee, it would not be appropriate for me to disclose information about the dates of its meetings or its proceedings.  The committee, which is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, comprises representatives at the highest level from the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Defence and Foreign Affairs, and the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  It is concerned with ensuring the Government and I are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but not operational security matters.  The committee will continue to meet as required. As well as attending meetings, the members of the committee liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments which might have national security implications, particularly in the international arena.</p>

            <p eId="para_4">It is becoming obvious there is an ease of access to the fraudulent use of Irish passports, a passport which has particular integrity and credibility in international relations.  In February this year, it emerged eight Irish passports were used fraudulently in an assassination in Dubai.  This month several other Irish passports, possibly up to six, were used as a part of a Russian spy ring in the US.  The concern, which I am sure the National Security Committee will consider, is the extent to which these fraudulent abuses continue and how little the Irish authorities know about them.  British passports were abused in exactly the same manner in the Dubai assassination scandal and their security was increased immediately.  No such security enhancement took place to protect Irish passports.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_6">I am coming to it.  The Taoiseach may be aware the number of Irish passports reported as lost or stolen in 2008 was 36,264, 6.3% of the total issued in 2008.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_8">The figure for 2009 was 33,214, 6% of total issued.  These are staggering figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Has the National Security Committee considered the ease of access to the fraudulent and illegal abuse of Irish passports?  Has the committee made a recommendation that security enhancements for the protection of Irish passports should be implemented?  Has it considered the implications of such large numbers of passports being reported lost or stolen?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">As I stated earlier, due to the nature of the committee's meetings, it is not appropriate to disclose the information concerning its meetings or any of its proceedings.  This is a matter to be directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has responsibility for the Passport Office.  There has been a debate in the House on the specific instances referred to by the Deputy.  Clearly this is an issue concerning older passports.  The questions the Deputy has raised are ones that can be directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so that the information will be available to him.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_11">While I do not want to raise details of the matters discussed by the national security committee, the consequences of what the committee does in this case should become clear.  In other words, there should be an analysis of what extra security arrangements must be made to protect the integrity of the Irish passport system.  We cannot have a situation in which forged Irish passports are being used, as happened in the assassination case in Dubai.  In addition, a number of Irish passports were used illegally by a Russian spy ring in the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">In recent days, the American President announced intelligence findings concerning at least two parcels containing explosives that were detected en route from Yemen to the United States.  One of them went through Great Britain.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_14">Some years ago, I raised a question here following reports that al-Qaeda cells were operating in this country.  Given previous reports of terrorist personnel being located here, what is the Government's response to the fact that at least one of the recently discovered parcels was being sent to the USA through Great Britain?  We have an interest in ensuring that freight passing through this country is screened properly.  We must not have a situation where, for their own reasons, somebody presses a button on a mobile phone and a sim card explodes material.  In the recent cases it was titanium in toner packages.  This has serious implications for international freight activities, so I am sure the Taoiseach will convey that concern to the national security committee.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_12">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_15">The gardaí are well aware of the international situation and the threat level involved.  They are maintaining contacts with their international counterparts in this regard.  The Government is determined to continue to take all necessary measures to deal with international terrorism.  It will play a full part in the international efforts to counteract the threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">As regards the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the discovery of two explosive devices on cargo aircraft bound for the United States is a very worrying development.  These devices are believed to have originated in Yemen and were bound for addresses in Chicago.  This bomb plot is a further indication of the ongoing threat from al-Qaeda-inspired militants.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">The threat from international terrorist groups against Ireland is considered to be low.  However, the situation is being monitored constantly by the Irish authorities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_13">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_18">The director-general of MI5 has said that there is a persistent rise in the ambition and activities of dissident groups on the island of Ireland.  I know there is a very high level of co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána and between both Governments, which I fully support.  More than likely, the identities of those concerned are known to the security forces.  In that context, what is the Government's latest assessment of the level of dissident or treacherous activity by so-called republicans?  What is the Government's analysis of the latest position?</p>
            <p eId="para_19">Has the Taoiseach yet received a copy of the 24th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, which is due out this month?  The personnel dealing with those reports are fully acquainted with the facts as they happen on the ground.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_14">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_20">I understand that report has come to hand recently, is being considered by Government and will be published in due course.  Regarding the earlier point about dissident threats, as the Deputy has suggested there is unanimous support in the House for full co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and the Garda Síochána in these matters.  The Chief Constable of the PSNI and the Garda Commissioner have confirmed that the level of co-ordination and co-operation is at an all-time high.  As one would expect, they co-operate fully in these matters and the necessary resources are being applied to deal with those who would constitute a threat to the security of the State or to others in terms of paramilitary activity or paramilitary intentions.  These are operational matters that the Garda Commissioner and his people deal with on an ongoing basis.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_15">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_21">In his reply the Taoiseach stated that due to the confidential nature of the work of the National Security Committee it would not be possible to give the dates, frequency and so on of the meetings of the committee and I understand this.  However, given the increased vigilance which is now being applied both in the United States and the United Kingdom with regard to the potential for and possibility of acts of international terrorism, has there been any increase in the frequency of meetings of the National Security Committee or in its work?  Does the Taoiseach hold a view on the statements made in recent days by the British Home Secretary and Prime Minister, especially with regard to freight and flights from Yemen to the UK, where, as I understand it, a ban has been placed on freight from Yemen?  Has any consideration been given to the source of freight entering Ireland or to any implications for security or for the shipment of freight through Ireland, especially through Irish airports?  Has there been any increase in the deployment of gardaí to deal with the evidence of an increased threat from dissident republicans?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_16">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_22">Regarding the third question, as the Deputy is aware these are operational matters.  The Commissioner deploys resources as required and he does not communicate on an ongoing basis as to what resources are being deployed for obvious reasons and for fear that people might regard that as increasing the possibility of abduction or the possibility of being found to be doing things they should not be doing.  These are operational matters with which the Commissioner deals all the time and resources are applied as required.  The Deputy will be aware generally that the security services in Ireland are working very closely to seek to have these people thwarted in any of their activities or planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">Regarding the question of cargo, as a result of what happened in recent days and the implications if any in Ireland, it is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Transport.  All Irish airports with regular commercial flights are required to comply with the requirements of the EU regulations on aviation security and the national civil aviation security programme.  Aviation security practices and procedures implemented at Irish airports, including those related to cargo, conform to EU common rules and to the highest standards internationally.  These practices and procedures are subject to monitoring by the Department of Transport and are also the subject of periodic reviews by international organisations such as the EU Commission and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">It is not the practice of the Minister to comment on specific security measures currently in place or that may be implemented at Irish airports or on monitoring activities carried out by his Department.  Aviation security arrangements at Irish airports are kept under continuous review by the Department of Transport and the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which is chaired by a senior official from that Department.  The committee comprises representatives of Departments, the State and regional airports, airlines, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, Customs and Excise, An Post, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Irish Airline Pilots' Association.  Everyone must take cognisance of these worrying developments and must liaise with the various international organisations with whom they normally deal in order to put in place, if required, any further scrutiny advisable in the circumstances.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_17">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_25">I appreciate that the Taoiseach cannot go into great detail with regard to levels of security and police co-operation on these matters.  In respect of the increased potential for acts of international terrorism and with regard to the increase in dissident activity, has there been an increase in the level of political contact between Ministers here and in Britain?  Has there been an increase in political contact at a European level with a view to addressing these threats?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_18">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_26">I am not specifically aware there has been ministerial contact in recent days in respect of what happened but there has been official contact.  Reviews are immediately put in place when something as serious as this happens.  There are procedures and protocols under various international conventions.  These kick in very quickly in light of the sensitivity of the aviation industry to issues such as this.  Ireland is in compliance with these and is an active participant in them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_19">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_27">Can the Taoiseach advise if it is within the scope of the national security committee to consider measures such as the further civilianising of the clerical and administrative roles within the Garda Síochána in order to maximise the release of trained officers to various policing responsibilities directly within the community and in any of the contexts described?  If it is within the scope, has it been given serious consideration?  Does the Taoiseach expect further action will be taken in that regard?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_20">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_28">It is not the practice of the national security committee to discuss operational matters.  The committee only deals with the question generally of what needs to be done with an issue that arises and what liaison is taking place.  It is not a question of getting into detail about policy implementation on civilianisation and matters of that nature.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_21">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_29">Is the Government happy there are no international terrorist cells operating in Ireland at the moment in so far as the national security committee is concerned?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_22">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_30">As I stated in a previous reply, the assessment is that the threat of the use of Ireland for such purposes is regarded as low but that is not to say there is a sense of complacency or that there is not activity in surveillance and monitoring.</p>

The Department is continuing to finalise the relocation of the remainder of staff who have applied for decentralisation.  In the case of a further 5,000 applications there was a deferral until 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Office of Public Works in St. Stephen's Green has not been vacated yet because some of the staff do not want to leave.  A further 180 staff were to go to Kanturk and Claremorris.  The moves to both of those locations appear to be stalled.  A total of 35 reviews on decentralisation are due to be carried out for next year.  Can we take it that the remaining staff are not going anywhere, literally, in the sense that significant amounts of money have been spent on purchasing sites and consultants' reports?  Are we leaving public servants living in a land of illusion that decentralisation to those locations will take place?  I am supportive of well-managed decentralisation because they have spread benefits throughout the country but this was an almighty botched job.  One is leaving thousands of people who have applied to be decentralised in a limbo in that they do not know whether it is ever going to happen.  We are now faced with 35 reviews to take place next year.  No one has any idea of whether they are going anywhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The Government bought sites at exorbitant prices, but there is no money in the kitty to build these things.  Is it time to tell people that decentralisation will either not occur or not occur for a long time?</p>

            <p eId="para_44">It is a voluntary scheme, as the Deputy knows.  There is no coercion involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">First of all, I welcome the Deputy's support for the decentralisation programme.  That was not the position of his former finance spokesperson, but they did not agree on everything.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">Regarding the situation of the transfer of places, we made the decision last year about deferring relocation in 35 cases — about 5,000 people — so that we could implement what was in hand, namely, the 4,400 being transferred.  That is being advanced and more than three quarters of those people have been relocated.  That is a significant move.  The Western Development Commission looked at the impact this had in the Deputy's own area and came forward with a positive report about the benefits of decentralisation to towns in the west, for example.  That is something of which the Deputy would be aware.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">Regarding the other issue of costs, the Comptroller and Auditor General has done a report on all of this and I understand the Committee of Public Accounts will be dealing with this matter on 2 December.  It is important to point out that the disposal and vacation of properties, etc., in Dublin in order to facilitate the funding of the decentralisation raised to the tune of about €550 million and the properties cost about €338 million for the relocations. Obviously, there are issues of costs to look at, but it is not correct to say that the thing has been unbalanced or that there has not been sufficient money raised to deal with that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_48">I said it was botched.  A well-planned decentralisation programme has always worked well, but this one was not well-planned.  In fairness to the man beside the Taoiseach and without being parochial about it, he wanted to send his Department closer to Knock Airport.  That was objected to and turned down by An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister then sent those staff to Tubbercurry with the intention of moving them to Charlestown.  A site was acquired, but the process is now stalled.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Some 35 reviews are pending for next year, many of which are in locations where land was bought for sites for decentralised offices, but nothing has happened or is happening.  Arising from the reviews, will decentralisation go ahead as originally intended?</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The Taoiseach mentioned the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  His September report was scathing of the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of how things were done and of the facts that FÁS paid more than double the original estimate for its headquarters' site in Birr, that 12 buildings there were lying entirely empty and that, in seven other locations, 40% of the available space is not being used.  This is an indication of a type of scheme that traditionally has been successful when well planned.  Due to the secrecy desired by the then Minister for Finance in this case, however, the programme has fallen asunder.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The Comptroller and Auditor General's report also stated that 12 sites costing €43.8 million were bought in locations where decentralisation is not proceeding and that five office blocks leased for €800,000 annually have been left under-occupied.  If ever anything smacked of indecisiveness and a lack of confidence, this is one scheme that has those in spades.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">The simple point I will make to the Deputy is that detailed questions on specific sites or issues should definitely be dealt with by the Department of Finance, which has overall charge.  I make the general point that the disposal of properties in Dublin at that time brought to the Exchequer a sum of the order of €550 million which greatly exceeds any costs incurred elsewhere.  I make that point because indications are often given about costs of acquisition but not about proceeds of sale.  In addition, €75 million worth of property was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership which can be calculated into that sum, and joint venture development schemes have been worked out by the OPW that also have a value.  These matters will be discussed in due course but I make the point to bring to attention the moves which have been made and those currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">The building in Newbridge for the Department of Defence is now complete and staff based in Dublin are scheduled to move there during November.  Similarly, in Roscommon town, the building for the Property Registration Authority was due to be completed before the end of October, with occupation to commence thereafter, and a preferred tender for the Tipperary town building for the Department of Justice and Law Reform has been selected and a letter of acceptance of tender is expected to issue shortly.  This is the rate of progress in respect of those ventures for which there are moves and those cases where deferrals have taken place will be reviewed in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">The Taoiseach stated that 3,180 staff had been moved to various locations as a result of decentralisation.  How many of those staff were moved from Dublin?  My understanding is that, to date, approximately half of the re-allocation of staff has been between locations outside Dublin and concerns staff who are already based outside Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">The Taoiseach stated that some of the decentralisation proposals have been deferred until 2011.  Is it still intended to go ahead with those proposals or will there be any scaling back?</p>
            <p eId="para_56">We were told there would be a review of the entire decentralisation programme and a final decision would be made on the projects which were to go ahead.  Has that review been completed and, if not, when is it likely to be completed?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_33">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_57">As the Deputy knows, that review is due to be considered and completed in 2011.  The current priority in the programme is to effect the decentralisation of those proposals which have been approved and are going ahead.  I gave broad figures and have some supplementary information to the effect that 3,153 people have moved, with 5,000 positions subject to review.  I do not have the numbers for movements intra-Dublin.  The position concerns the number of posts that were to be created in decentralised locations.  Where these are open they will be made available to people.  The fact is that some 3,000 people have moved to those locations.  Regarding decentralisation, if a person from Wexford in a position in Limerick had a possibility of moving to Wexford, that is as much a decentralisation for that person as it would be to move from Dublin to Tubbercurry.  It is the same principle.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_34">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_58">It is not because we need to know how much double counting is involved.  The Taoiseach stated that if somebody moves from Limerick to Wexford, that is a move according to plan.  However, if there is a corresponding move by somebody from Wexford back to Limerick or from somewhere else to Limerick to fill the vacancy that arises, that is double counting.  My understanding of the original plan for decentralisation was to move about one third of the Civil Service out of Dublin.  If that is the case we need to have some measure as to how successful or otherwise that plan was.  The original figure for decentralisation out of Dublin was 10,922.  How much of that decentralisation has occurred?  Also, will the Taoiseach say whether any assessment has been made on the impact of the efficiency of Departments as a result of decentralisation?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_35">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_59">I do not have that level of detailed information, and it would be best to ask the Department of Finance.  I am just giving the Deputy the information I have.  Of the 3,180 staff who have been unable to move to various locations across the country, some 2,200 have been to various locations which are not the gateway and hub towns.  The remaining 900 have relocated to gateways and hubs, and have increased the total number of civil servants in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies located in those gateway and hub locations outside Dublin.  That figure has now moved to 13,300.  Therefore, 3,180 posts have been allocated to almost 40 locations.  Full completion of the projects under way and approved will result in approximately 4,400 moves overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">That is the only information I have about the benefit from moves, efficiency and so on.  However, the Western Development Commission did a study in 2009 which found the economic impact of the relocation of public sector jobs to the western region had been positive and significant.  The report said public sector employees had taken up opportunities to relocate there for quality of life issues, in particular the many benefits realised by easier commuting to work.  For those who had moved from Dublin, the western region offered many advantages, such as cost savings, lower living costs and house prices, as well as benefits from living within close communities, being closer to families and living in rural locations.  The impacts were significant in all cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">A wide range of factors has been taken into account and balanced against each other in the selection of Departments or agencies for decentralisation.  The national spatial strategy envisaged that county towns and other medium-sized towns, particularly those strategically placed in a regional context, would have roles to play in acting as so-called local capitals.  They would allow for the development of their service functions and provide opportunities for a diversified employment base and productivity growth, both in the towns and in the related smaller villages and rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">Virtually all the locations included in the decentralisation programme are explicitly mentioned in section 4 of the national spatial strategy, which outlines how each region will participate in the strategy.  The relocation of public service employment to towns such as these underpins the important role which many must continue to play into the future.  That is as much information as I can give the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I am asking the Taoiseach.  I have only cited Drogheda as an example.  We can take Mullingar or Waterford, where respectively €8 million and €8.25 million were spent in relation to the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Three sites cost a total of €26.5 million.  What does the Taoiseach expect will now happen to these very high-priced sites?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_66">A review of the next phase of the decentralisation programme will possibly indicate the use or otherwise of some of those sites.  The issue, in terms of the current phase, including acquisitions such as the Deputy has mentioned, is to the effect that total expenditure on the property aspect of the programme up to December 2009 was €338 million.  Those costs were offset by savings achieved through the reallocation of property by the OPW to other schemes at the end of 2008 valued in the region of €550 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">Those costs were offset by savings from a reallocation of property by the OPW to other schemes at the end of 2008, valued in the region of €550 million.  Of that amount, more than €350 million relates to the disposal of high value sites at the height of the property boom.  Property valued at that time at €75 million was transferred to the affordable homes partnership.  Those are the facts in that regard.  If there are details required in relation to individual matters a parliamentary question should be tabled to the Department of Finance.</p>

However, I am speaking specifically of the sites purchased at high prices.  Can I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the sites at Drogheda, Mullingar and Waterford remain under consideration?  Is it his intention to hold those sites open and for how long before a decision is taken on what use they will be put to or there being once again offered on the open market?</p>

There is a review to take place next year in regard to the many sites in respect of which a decision has been deferred, which sites may well include those referred to by the Deputy.  In that context, decisions will be made in regard to what arrangements will be put in place for the following phase of decentralisation, which may involve the use of those sites for that purpose.  Until the review is complete, one cannot be certain what will happen.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_42">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_71">There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the social welfare appeals office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the number received in 2007.   I am advised by the social welfare appeals office that as of 26 October 2010 20,936 cases are being processed through various stages of the appeals system, 10, 227 of which are receiving attention in the social welfare appeals office; 9,277 of which are receiving attention in the Department and 1,432 of which are awaiting responses from appellants.  As these figures indicate, the nature of the appeals process and its various stages mean that at any one time there are a significant proportion of appeals on hands which have not yet reached the stage of being ready for the attention of appeals officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">A total of 20,171 appeals were finalised in the period January to end September 2010.  The overall average time taken to process all appeals was 27.5 weeks.   Of these, 5212 or 25.8% were revised decisions by deciding officers following receipt of the appeal and 2,267 or 11.2%, were withdrawn.  The remaining 12,692 decisions were made by appeals officers as follows: 8,701 or 68.6% by summary decisions and 3,991 or 31.4% following an oral hearing.  The average time taken to process a summary decision was 28 weeks and the average time to process an oral hearing was 44.5 weeks.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in such process.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">During 2009, 59% of all appeal cases were dealt with by way of oral hearing but due to some of the initiatives outlined below this has been reduced to 31% to date in 2010.  To be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are dealt with in chronological order.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">Of the 27.5 weeks overall average, 13 weeks was attributable to ongoing processes within the social welfare appeals office; 12.4 weeks was attributable to work in progress within the Department and 2.1 weeks was due to responses awaited from appellants.  Of the appeals finalised, 8,69 or 43% were favourable to the appellant; 9,207 or 46% were unfavourable and the remaining 2,267 or 11% were withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">There has been a significant increase in the number of appeals being made to the social welfare appeals office.  Currently, it is anticipated that some 33,000 appeals will be received for 2010, which is compared to roughly 15,000 a year in the years up to and including 2007.   The scale of the increase has resulted in significant delays in the processing of appeals.  Improving these processing times is a major objective of the office and, in that regard, a number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows, namely, three additional appeals officers have been assigned to the office since January 2009; additional staff have been assigned to the administration area of the office; more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity; a  project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken resulting in a number of improvements being implemented; and significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.  In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired appeals officers strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources, eight of whom have been operating on a part-time basis since July.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">I am assured by the chief appeals officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">We are in the middle of the worst recession since the foundation of the State.  Does the Minister believe it is right that people should have to wait, in some cases six to seven months, for their appeal to be heard?  I want to know that from the Minister because I want to be able to tell my constituents, and the people of this country, what he, as Minister for Social Protection, is doing about that.  What action is he taking?  What staff is he employing to address the problem?  Does the Minister believe it is right, with 465,000 unemployed, to bring back retired people when we have graduates with all kinds of degrees that we could train in a very short time and give them these jobs instead of bringing back people who are retired?</p>

            <p eId="para_79">The following steps have been taken.  Three additional officers were assigned to the office since January 2009.  Additional staff have been assigned to the administrative area of the office.  More emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis to increase productivity.  A project to improve the business process in the office was undertaken which resulted in a number of improvements being implemented.  Significant enhancement has been made to the office's IT and telephone systems and, in addition, as the Deputy referred to, experienced retired appeals officers have been taken on to supplement the current resources, strictly on a short-term basis, and eight of those have been operating on a part-time basis since July.  In terms of the result of that work, because they are very experienced it has been dramatic and that is what has allowed us to increase dramatically the number of appeals dealt with this year.  The difficulty we face, however, is that as the number of appeals dealt with has increased so has the number of appeals coming into the office.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">The Minister mentioned earlier the number of appeals that were overturned by the independent appeals officer.  In regard to the way the Minister's schemes are being implemented by the staff, are the staff being trained correctly when so many appeals are being overturned because the initial decision was wrong?  I am asking the Minister what he intends to do about that because it is not fair on people who are waiting for jobseeker's benefit or carer's allowance.  The people who are waiting on decisions on appeals need to get them faster, and we need staff put in place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_81">I agree fully with the Deputy that we must process more appeals faster.  We are doing that, and there has been a dramatic improvement this year.  However, what has also happened is that the number of appeals has increased at the same time.  While 43% of appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant, of the 8,697 favourable decisions in appeals cases, almost two thirds of those decisions — 5,212 — were revised decisions made by statutorily appointed deciding officers of my Department who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  In many cases those revised decisions arose as a result of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his or her claim.  In such cases an appeals officer decision was not necessary.  In addition, it should be noted that of the 12,692 appeals decided by appeals officers, a total of 9,207, or 73%, upheld the original decision of the deciding officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">One of the major challenges faced by us is the information provided on appeal.  I am sure the Deputy has experience of somebody who comes in and appeals it, and he then encourages them to provide data which, if it had been available earlier, would have avoided the need for an appeal.  The figures bear out clearly what we have to examine, namely, whether there are processes we could put in place that would encourage people to give the full information at the outset because if that happened it would cut out many delays and save a great deal of work in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">Marriages of convenience, or "sham marriages", are marriages which are entered into for the purpose of one of the parties gaining an automatic right of residency based on marriage to a person who already has a right of residency.  These marriages exploit Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which deals with the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states.  This directive came into force on 20 April 2006.  The matter was further compounded by the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case on 25 July 2008, which held that these rights applied to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals.  As has been widely reported in the media, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has lodged objections to a large number of marriages involving non-EU-EEA nationals under section 58 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">Under the Act, if the objection relates to the possible existence of a specified impediment to the intended marriage, it is referred to the Registrar General to be investigated.  The objection can only be upheld if it is based on the provisions of the Civil Registration Act and these do not include questioning the reason for marriage.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Since the enactment of the marriage provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004 on 5 November 2007 a total of 73 objections have been lodged by the Garda National Immigration Bureau for investigation under section 58(4) of the Act.  To date, one of the objections has been withdrawn, and the couple in question has been advised that the marriage could proceed.  The remaining objections are still under investigation by the Registrar General.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">While objections to marriages are upheld if there is an impediment, it is important to point out that issues which go to the identity of a party to a marriage or to consent to marry can also, potentially, render a marriage invalid.  In such cases, it would be unsafe to allow the marriage to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">Newly updated Guidelines for Registrars for Marriage Notifications containing requirements concerning notification procedures, including the verification of identity and marital status, have been recently issued by the Registrar General to all registrars.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">I am also aware that this matter has been considered by the Department of Justice and Law Reform in the context of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">I can assure the Deputy that the matter is being researched urgently with a view to identifying the further measures that may be taken, including the possibility of legislating for any such measures.  I am aware that procedures to prevent marriages of convenience are in place in other EU member states, and I would hope that equivalent measures might be introduced here.  The General Register Office, GRO, has sought legal advice as to its legal options and will proceed on the basis of this advice as quickly as possible once it is received.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">Does the Minister accept that all of the indications are that this is a significant problem?  The registrar suggested recently that as many as 15% of civil ceremonies could be sham marriages.  We also know that there has been a huge increase in the number of non-EU citizens applying for residency based on marriage to an EU citizen.  I understand the figure is over 1,000 in the first six months of this year.  All the indications are, therefore, that this is a significant problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">I want the Minister to clarify a number of aspects.  First, is it the case that the Attorney General intervened recently to prevent registrars from asking probing questions and advised them that such an approach was not supported by the law?  Second, can the Minister tell us now the legal position?  Is it a criminal offence to enter a sham marriage for the purposes of circumventing residency rules?  Furthermore, is it a criminal offence to assist or facilitate such a marriage?</p>

What we do know is the number of marriages between EU and EEA nationals and non-nationals since 2008.  In 2008 there were 2,292.  In 2009 there were——</p>

Most other EU states have laws to prevent such sham marriages and the fact that we do not means that Ireland has become a soft-touch location for such marriages.  We are told by reports in the media that there has been intense lobbying of the Government by several EU countries about the growing problem of sham marriages.  We also know that since as far back as 2006, the Latvian Government has been making regular approaches to this Government asking for the law to be changed in view of the large number of young Latvian women who have been enticed into this practice.  Can the Minister tell us how many other countries have lobbied him to change the law?  When are we likely to see some movement in this area, given the level of concern that has been expressed by other EU member states?</p>

I understand other foreign embassies have stated their concerns by contacting the General Register Office.  The feedback from these embassies suggests that the requirement in the new guidelines to obtain official authentication of foreign birth certificates is of assistance to embassies in identifying marriages of convenience.  In such cases the embassy in question can interview the person concerned and advise him or her of the implications and risks of what they are undertaking.  I assure the Deputy——</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael Ring</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
          his Department’s fraud savings target for 2010; the amount that has been saved to date 
        [38981/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_82" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_127">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day to day work of the Department.  A key objective of the Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely, prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage; early detection through effective review of claims in payment; measures to deter fraud; and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.  The rapidly changing economic environment, with large increases in the number of people unemployed, poses challenges for the prevention and effective management of fraud and control.  The Department's response to these challenges has been to introduce new, evidence-based measures to target control activity at high-risk categories of claimants.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment, and represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure on fraudulent claims.  Actual recoveries arise where the Department raises overpayments in individual cases.  A target of €533 million was set for control savings in 2010.  At the end of September this year, some €323 million in estimated control savings had been recorded.  However, work-to-rule measures in the Department earlier this year affected the reporting of the value of control activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">Control activity is being focused on the prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage, as this is the most cost-effective mechanism of reducing losses in social welfare schemes.  This is what I call a gate-keeper effect.  However, savings made at application stage cannot be estimated as the claim does not go into payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">In my view welfare fraud is theft.  It is a serious crime and the Department is doing everything it can to target the people who abuse the system.  The consequences for social welfare fraud can be severe.  Criminal prosecutions may be taken against persons who defraud the social welfare payment system and employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations.  Fraud detection measures have increased and improved significantly over the last number of years and will continue to be reviewed to prioritise resources in order to achieve results.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard, the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are refined to ensure they remain effective.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_132">I want to put a straight question to the Minister.  In the week of the volcanic ash crisis this year, 3,500 fewer people signed on for the dole.  I ask the Minister to confirm to the House and to the country that welfare tourism — that is, people flying in from other countries on cheap flights to claim social welfare — is not taking place.  Did the Department investigate the reason 3,500 fewer people signed on during that crisis?</p>
            <p eId="para_133">Why has the Minister reduced the projected savings due to reductions in fraud?  He was hoping in 2009 to achieve savings of €616 million but this has been reduced in 2010 to €533 million.  People are concerned about two different types of welfare fraud — one type in another jurisdiction not far from us and the other type perpetrated by people flying in from abroad.  I want the country and the House to be reassured that this is not happening.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_84" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_134">I answered that question comprehensively with facts and figures on Committee Stage of the Bill we debated during the early summer.  However, I will send the detailed facts to the Deputy.  These show that the week in question was not exceptional in terms of the number of people not signing on.  Off the top of my head, around 90% of the people who did not sign on that week were Irish.  Of the rest, some of the applicants were from faraway parts of the world, such as Pakistan, India, Australia and America, which does not fit in with the "cheap flights" idea.  If anything, the figures from that week show that few people were discommoded by the ash cloud.  The data shows that it is not true that thousands of people are flying in to collect social welfare payments.  All the evidence is that because people must now collect unemployment payments every week — they must physically attend the post office and provide their identities to the postmaster or postmistress — that is not the area in which the greatest savings are to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">As the Deputy knows, we have done a lot of work on control savings.  As I said in my reply, in the early part of the year the control measures were in place and savings were being made but, because of the industrial action, these savings were not reported.  It did not make any difference to the savings that were made on the ground, but it did make a difference to the reporting, and that has affected the figures.</p>

However, it is not strictly speaking an identity card and perhaps we should not use that term; it is a social services card.

            <p eId="para_157">Activation and support for those who are unemployed is a key priority for Government.  Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced a number of changes to improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas.  These changes included the restructuring of departmental responsibilities with the objective of providing a streamlined response to the income support and job search needs of people who are unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">In this context, my Department is devising proposals for the development of new initiatives based on the rural social scheme and the community services programme which will offer social employment opportunities.  This new initiative will be an important element in the development and delivery of employment and community services and will aim to provide quality work opportunities to the unemployed and beneficial outcomes to the community.  A key feature of the new scheme will be to provide a new activation route that will support unemployed people in remaining job-ready for re-entry to employment as the economic environment improves.</p>

            <p eId="para_159">In the summer during the Dáil recess, the Minister announced that he would create 10,000 to 15,000 community scheme places.  The rural social scheme has worked very well and while I would like to see more places on that scheme, it would only deal with a certain section of society.  How does the Minister propose to get the other 300,000 people on to community schemes such that there is no extra cost to the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_160">Approximately 270,000 people are getting payment for a full week; in other words, many people on the live register are working part-time.  It is intended to focus particularly on people on jobseeker's allowance who have been in receipt of unemployment payment for more than a year.  It will be done using the model of the rural social scheme but extending eligibility to people who have been on long-term jobseeker's allowance; in other words, it will take away the requirement to be either a fisherman or a farmer.  It seems to be the most efficient and simplest way to do it.  It will require an extension of the scheme into the cities where there is serious unemployment as well as in rural areas and I hope to be able to roll it out in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">However, it must be linked to the other part, which is an employment action plan.  The idea is to identify the people eligible for a scheme and to get agreement to provide their names to the various groups that would be organising the schemes and then to allow them to provide the employment.  Obviously, those who are not available to go on a scheme, including those who do not respond to employment action programmes, will be intensively interviewed.  People who do not turn up for interviews after two requests without some valid excuse will have their payments suspended.  We cannot have people available for work and actively seeking work, but unavailable for interview when asked to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">Will this be compulsory?  We do not want unemployed accountants and doctors asked to go out and clean the streets, which would be a very unfair way to get people off social welfare and I hope this scheme will not do so.  When people lose their jobs and go to their local social welfare office, they are advised of their entitlements, but are not told of the training or job opportunities available and how they can get retrained.  When will we have a one-stop shop so that they do not need to go all over the place to get the information?  What plans does the Department have to develop such a solution?</p>

            <p eId="para_163">There are two questions there.  I said that we would make the names available to the various community groups.  The Deputy has been working with the community sector for long enough to know that a community group will try to place people in jobs that suit them.  I am astounded that the question of whether community groups would force people with qualifications to do jobs that do not suit them keeps coming up; I have never come across a community group that would do that.  However, it will be mandatory for an accountant on the dole or a doctor on jobseeker's allowance who is called for interview to attend that interview.  Obviously, the first avenue for people attending interview will be to try to get them into productive employment; the second avenue is training or education; and the third avenue would be a scheme job.  It is absolutely fair to say that people will be placed in occupations that would be suitable for them.  The level of community work goes way beyond trimming the hedges on the side of the road — important and all as that is.  I have a list of all the different community work jobs, which is considerably wider than that.  It is very degrading of community work to continually refer just to trimming of hedges.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">I hope the Deputy will facilitate this happening.  As he knows, I will shortly introduce a Bill, which I hope to enact before Christmas, to facilitate the final transfer of responsibility for FÁS to my Department.  The purpose of that transfer is to do precisely what the Deputy suggests.  In future when people go into an employment exchange they will also be activated in the same place in a seamless service.  I look forward to the Deputy's full co-operation in getting the Bill through quickly so that we can move early in the new year on that.</p>

        <b>Deputy Billy Timmins</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
          the number of defined benefit pension schemes which fail the minimum funding standard; the number of persons affected by this; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [39269/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_107" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_167">Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge their accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the funding standard, the sponsors or trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within a three-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">At the end of 2009, there were 254,325 members in 1,192 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  It was estimated at that time that in excess of 75% of these schemes were in deficit.  A recent survey undertaken by the Pensions Board found that 70% of schemes were reported to be in deficit.  However, the extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">The Government is conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds during 2007 and 2008.  While schemes recovered some of their losses in the past year or so, I am anxious to ensure, in so far as possible, that pension scheme trustees and employers have sufficient time and space to assess fully the implications for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.  This was the thinking behind the implementation of a number of temporary measures in December 2008 to ease the funding pressures on pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">In addition, the  Pensions Act was amended by Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 to provide for a number of measures which would support the trustees and employers in responding to the significant challenges they encountered following the down turn in the financial markets.  In March this year, the Government launched the national pensions framework.  It sets out the our intention for a radical and wide-scale reform of the Irish pension system.  I announced last month  that work on the new defined benefit pension model, as outlined in this framework, would be expedited.  My Department will aim to introduce this new model following legislative changes  on 1 July 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">Following this announcement, the deadline of 30 November for the submission of funding proposal to the Pensions Board was deferred. It is anticipated that the deferral of this deadline will allow schemes time to take account of reforms to the defined benefit model in the preparation of funding proposals for submission to the Pensions Board by a date which will be announced by the board.</p>

            <p eId="para_172">Does the Minister agree that the ineptitude of the Government is best reflected in its failure to deal with the issue of the pensions time bomb for more than a decade?  Does he also agree that it is disgraceful that 200,000 people who have paid into defined benefit schemes might not have their expectations met and that nothing has been done by the Government in the interim other than to defer dates?  When will there will be positive results?  When will the new defined benefit scheme be established?  Everything appears to have been put on the long finger.  What proposals has the Minister to deal with the shortfall?  What message can he send to the 200,000 people who will not receive the pensions they expected?</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_173">As I announced recently, it is our intention to bring forward a new defined benefit model, the idea of which is to have core benefits and then to have top-up benefits, depending on the market.  It will not be mandatory for schemes that are properly funded to transfer to this scheme but it will be available for schemes with funding difficulties.  There is a tight timeframe for introducing all the necessary legislation by 1 July 2011 and, therefore, the Deputy cannot say we are dragging our heels on this.  Legislative changes will be required and that is our intention.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">The Government also published a comprehensive pensions framework last February and I reject the contention that it has not been active on this issue.  The collapse in the value of equities on markets worldwide has had a devastating effect on the pensions industry and while some of the losses have been made back this year, they do not compensate for the losses of previous years.</p>

            <p eId="para_176">The Minister referred to returns on equity investments being bad over the past number of years.  Returns were not bad over the past year.  However, the National Pensions Reserve Fund only achieved a return of 2.5% on an investment of €7 billion in 2009.  The fund was set up to protect pensions into the future but every policy from every political party proposes to raid the fund.  At this stage it has probably been raided ten times over.  What is the Minister's view on the raiding of the fund?  Has he considered other measures to deal with the pensions shortfall such as increasing the pension age or reducing pensions?  Has he thought of anything outside the box?</p>

That makes a great deal of common sense.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian O’Shea</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
          his plans to recruit and divert more appeals officers to the Social Welfare Appeals Office to deal with the backlog of social welfare appeals 
        [40035/10]

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_182">There has been a significant increase in the number of appeals received by the social welfare appeals office in recent years, largely as a result of increased unemployment during the economic downturn.  The number of appeals received by the office in 2009 increased by 46% compared to 2008, which, in turn, was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007.   In response, my Department assigned three additional permanent appeals officers in January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">The Department has also pursued other options to deal with the increasing inflow of appeals including operational and process changes.  These have included additional staff who have been assigned to the administration area of the office; more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity; a project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented; and significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">The social welfare appeals system is quasi-judicial in nature and the determinations made by appeals officers are governed by relevant social welfare legislation and by case law.  It takes considerable time for newly appointed officers to become fully proficient in the full range of the Department's schemes and legislation.  Accordingly, as an exceptional measure, it was decided to re-employ, on a temporary contract basis, a number of retired officers.  Eight retired appeals officers, working on a part-time basis, have been employed in my Department since June 2010.  It was expected that the provision of experienced staff resources would yield an immediate dividend in terms of making inroads into the number of appeals on hand.  This has proven to be the case with 3,000 cases having being finalised by them in the period June to the end of September.  It is expected that a further 3,000 cases will be finalised before the end of the year.  It is intended that the retired officers will be retained until the end of 2011 if the number of appeals on hands warrants this.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The Department is reviewing the situation on an ongoing basis and will seek to ensure that adequate resources are provided to the appeals office, having regard to the current moratorium on recruitment and promotions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_186">Does the Minister agree the appeals system is a shambles?  Every Member is only too well aware of the difficulties.  For example, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle recently drew attention to this problem.  The typical waiting time for an appeal is in excess of nine months.  Oral hearings that were first requested in August 2009 have not yet been heard.  That is how bad it is.  The Minister referred to the additional staff he has provided.  Does he accept the information I received in reply to a recent parliamentary question, which stated the capacity of the appeals office is to handle 29,000 appeals in the current year?  However, there is demand for 50,000 appeals.  How does he intend to bridge that gap?  Not only are the delays costing the State and claimants money, waiting times will worsen unless the Department meets demand.  What action does the Minister intend to take?</p>

            <p eId="para_187">I have outlined considerable actions that have been taken and the results can be seen.  Up to the end of September 2009, 12,873 appeals were heard while the figure up to the end of September 2010 increased to 20,171.  The challenge we face is that up to 2007 the average number of appeals per annum was 15,000 but that has jumped——</p>

            <p eId="para_189">——and it is expected that upwards of 33,000 appeals will be received this year.  The number of appeals, therefore, has more than doubled.  We are taking many steps to streamline the process and to make sure, for example, where further information is provided that the case does not go through the appeals process and is referred back to the Department where the decision can be revised.  These steps are having the desired effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">Furthermore, as I pointed out in my answer, some of the steps we took did not happen until mid-year, such as bringing back retired appeals officers, so I hope we can build up to a situation where we at least meet the increased demand.  Our next challenge is to get ahead of ourselves and reduce the existing lists.  I see this happening in a multifaceted way; we must look at why so many people make appeals in the first place.</p>

            <p eId="para_194">The other point I ask him to accept is that given 40% of those appeals fail, and that many of those whose appeals do not succeed are entitled to supplementary welfare allowance, every month there is a delay in hearing appeals that costs the taxpayer €600,000.  What is the Minister doing to put in place a modern public service in the appeals office that will deal with appeals in a timely fashion and why is he not attaching more urgency to this given the huge costs involved to the taxpayer, costs that could be avoided?</p>

The Deputy is wrong on a number of points, she is adding the number of appeals that will come in this year and the full backlog but there will always be some appeals on hand and because it takes time to deal with appeals, they will never reach zero.

            <p eId="para_197">There will always be carry over of appeals into the following year, which the Deputy totally ignores in her mathematics.  It takes time to deal with appeals because this is a quasi-judicial situation.  I outlined the time taken in the answer to the priority question; it is needed because when an appeal is made, it is examined, if there is new information it is sent back for an opportunity for the deciding officer to change the decision, then it comes back and an appeals officer looks at it.  In some cases, the appeal then goes to an oral hearing.  There will never be a situation where zero time is taken for an appeal, there will always be appeals under way, that has always been the way.  The Deputy's mathematics ignore that.</p>

            <p eId="para_206">It is obvious that many decisions are now being revised before they go through a full appeal because the applicants are giving information on appeal that they are not giving in the initial application.  It is interesting to look at the statistics I gave this afternoon that show we must look at ways to encourage people to give the information at the first stage that obviates the necessity for an appeal because many successful appeals are based on further information being provide the second time around.  I should look at Deputy Durkan's point, that there should be a way to engineer a situation where people do not feel the need to appeal.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_133" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_208">The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">With effect from 19 July 2010, changes have been made to the qualifying conditions of the back to education scheme to reflect the present economic situation.  The period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing BTEA was reduced from 12 months to nine months.  A two year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from illness benefit.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">In addition, a person can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas, prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if he was commencing year one of a course.  This also applies to people who are granted an exemption from a period of the third level course.  A person who completed an earlier year or years of his third level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker's payment may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">These enhancements build on other improvements made to the scheme in recent years in response to the changing economic climate.  From September 2007, the qualifying period for illness benefit was reduced from three years to two years; from September 2008, the cost of education allowance, which is an additional annual payment made to cover the cost of books and materials, was increased from €400 to €500; and from September 2009, the six month waiting period for those pursuing second level courses was reduced to three months.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">A jobseeker who wishes to participate in a part-time course may do so under the Department's part-time education option.  Participants may continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements provided they continue to satisfy all the existing terms and conditions of their jobseeker scheme including availability for work.</p>
            <p eId="para_213">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">The number of participants on the back to education scheme in the 2009-10 academic year was 20,808, which represented a 79% increase on the previous year.  The number of participants in the 2008-09 academic year also represented an increase of 31% on the previous academic year.  As of 22 October, approximately 21,500 participants were approved for the back to education allowance.  Due to the nature of the scheme a significant number of applications are processed in October and indications are that BTEA numbers will increase noticeably again for this academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">The Government has devoted significant resources to the back to education allowance.  The challenges presented by the changed economic circumstances are being addressed at a cross departmental and agency level.  Specifically, joint approaches have been adopted by the Departments of Social Protection, Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Education and Skills to the development of a range of activation programmes which support the unemployed in getting work, work experience or the education and skills that will support them in the search for employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">The national employment action plan is the main measure that addresses progression of those on the live register.  Under the NEAP, the Department refers persons to FÁS at three months.  The process provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.  A total of 157,000 training and work experience places will be provided by FÁS in 2010, compared to 66,000 places in 2008 and 130,000 places in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">Full-time opportunities are being provided for more than 40,000 learners, including the unemployed, under the Youthreach, Senior Traveller Training Centre, vocational training opportunity scheme and post-leaving certificate, PLC, programmes.  VTOS, Youthreach and STTC participants receive a training allowance in lieu of their social welfare payments and are eligible for a range of additional meal, travel and long-term unemployment bonus allowances.  They are also eligible to access child care supports.  Unemployed PLC participants may avail of the BTEA.  Part-time opportunities, targeted at the low-skilled, the disadvantaged and the hard to reach, including the unemployed, are available through the back to education initiative, adult literacy and community education schemes and together will cater for an estimated 125,000 learners in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">Other activation measures include the work placement and the short time work training programmes, sponsored by the Department of Education and Skills.  Also included is a range of third level labour market activation initiatives for jobseekers, which in 2009 supported more than 3,000 unemployed people to embark on a range of newly developed transition and accelerated programmes in institutes of technology, as well as part-time undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in institutes of yechnology and universities that support the goals of the smart economy.  In addition, the labour market activation fund is supporting almost 60 innovative projects and 12,000 participants in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_219">Given the qualification requirements now in place, and having regard to his references to 2007, 2008 and 2009, and the fact that this is 2010 and the economic situation is more serious than was the case one, two or three years ago, will the Minister look at the obstacles that exist to ensure the greatest possible number of young people who are anxious about going back to education, to provide for themselves now and in future, be dealt with as a matter of urgency?</p>

            <p eId="para_220">Since 22 October, 21,500 participants were approved for the back to education scheme.  This compares with 20,808 in 2009-10, which was a 79% increase on the previous year.  The scheme has been broadened and increased dramatically.  We must be careful in drawing up terms for this scheme not to create dead weight.  It is clear we should focus much of the effort on second level qualifications because those who are further down the education chain find it more difficult to get a job.  Those who experience the greatest difficulty getting employment are those with the least employment opportunities.  The case has been made to extend the scheme to cover masters' degrees and second primary degrees but that would involve a major commitment to expenditure and we must compare that with the chances people who already have a degree have to get a job.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">Will the Minister accept this scheme is in need of urgent reform?  The Department's view is that everything is okay as long as it is treading water.  The fact is there is a huge demand for places on this scheme.  What on earth is the reason for not allowing people to participate in third level courses after being unemployed for three months?  There seems to be a mindset in the Department that people will give up their jobs if it is made too easy for them to do so.  The nature of unemployment has completely changed.  What is the sense in making people wait longer than three months before allowing them to participate on a course through this scheme?  Should we not encourage people to go back to education and enhance their educational qualifications so that they will be ready to avail of employment opportunities when the economic recovery eventually comes?  What is the Minister's defence for not allowing this to happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_225">It comes down to using the limited resources available.  A large number of people who lose a job regain other employment in the first six months.  This figure then tails off——</p>

            <p eId="para_227">It still is the case.  After the first six months, the figure tends to tail off.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">A person getting access to a third level course through the back to education scheme will be paid the equivalent of the jobseeker's allowance, a minimum of €10,000 a year, for the foreseeable future.  That is an expensive commitment to make, so the best use of resources and money must be ensured.  Until recently, allocating the allowance was focused on those finding it difficult to get employment.  That same argument applies to allowing people to do second degrees, as I pointed out earlier to Deputy Durkan.  It is important for the scheme's focus to be retained at second level education participation because the evidence shows people with degrees have a much better chance of getting jobs than those who do not complete second level education.</p>

I had the case of a young girl on jobseeker's allowance who fell four weeks short of the time criteria for qualifying for the back to education scheme.  She was accepted, however, into the first year of a nursing course but was denied the back to education allowance.  She appealed the decision and continued to participate in the course.  Now, the Department has even withdrawn her jobseeker's allowance.  There is neither rhyme, reason nor consistency in the Department's actions.  Will the Minister review the scheme urgently?</p>

No matter where one draws the line when it comes to the cut-off criteria for allowances, there will be always someone on the wrong side of it.  I accept it is difficult for the individuals affected but it is inherent in the whole social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">Regarding the wider question of whether it should be easier to get on to the scheme, it is important to bear in mind the overall cost and using the moneys for the best.</p>

We now have the unprecedented, bizarre, even GUBU-esque, situation where the number of vacant seats exceeds the Government's working majority.  It is bad for democracy, is anti-democratic and smacks of cowardice on the Government's part when those in the constituencies with vacancies are not allowed their mandate or the people a national verdict on the Government.  The Taoiseach continues to brazen it out when he knows he does not have a valid authority to govern.  The people no longer believe the Government and neither do those outside the country.  The Taoiseach's credibility has crumbled, the Government's integrity shattered.  The 7.42% interest rate demanded by the bond markets this evening means the Government's proposed budgetary plan is already dead in the water because the international markets see no credibility in the projections for the economy's growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The only credible action that will restore people's faith in politics is if the Government goes to them to test its mandate for whatever budgetary proposal it wants to make.  In view of the continuing instability both at home and abroad, I challenge the Taoiseach and the Government to stand up and be counted.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to put his budgetary plan to the people?</p>

          <p eId="para_252">Data from the October tax returns will be available today at 4.30 p.m. which will confirm our tax take and budgetary plans are on track and expenditure is under control.  The urgency to bring forward a four-year economic plan and a budget that will front-load the necessary adjustments of €15 billion is in the national interest.  The Government will not abdicate its responsibility in this respect and will look, where it is possible, to obtain responsible support.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">As was stated by the Ceann Comhairle at the opening of today's proceedings, Dr. Jim McDaid has tendered his resignation as a Member of this House.  I wish him well.  He has been a friend and colleague for many years.  The Ceann Comhairle echoed what he stated first in September 2009 since when he has had an opinion on those issues.

As one of the Ministers told after the Farmleigh episode, "If you are on antibiotics for 13 years, you do become immune to a lot of things".  That comment came from the Taoiseach's own ranks.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The country is unable to borrow money now.  The Government cannot go back to the bond markets because the interest rates are too high and we are paying too much money to deal with this.  The reason is that the international markets have no faith, credibility or belief in the strategy the Government is adopting.  It is depicted by the first line of the Government's amendment to the Fine Gael Private Members' motion, which is down for discussion this evening.  The motion refers to the lack of impetus in dealing with serious crime and activities at a high level in banking institutions here, for which nobody has been punished.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">On yesterday's statement by the Minister for Health and Children in which she announced a voluntary redundancy scheme in the Health Service Executive, from that announcement, it would appear that it is intended to have a scheme for about 4,000 HSE staff.  This voluntary redundancy scheme has been a while in coming.  As far back as November 2004, the then chairman of the interim HSE, Mr. Kevin Kelly, told us that there was too much bureaucracy in the system.  On 17 October 2007, the Minister herself told the Dáil that there was scope for a voluntary redundancy programme and that she intended to discuss it with the new health forum.  In his statement on 8 July 2008, the Minister for Finance told us that his Department and the Department of Health and Children were drawing up proposals for a targeted scheme to reduce surplus staff in the HSE.  On 27 September 2008, the then chief executive of the HSE told us that 1,000 backroom jobs would go over the following 12 months.  In his budget speech on 14 October 2008, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that discussions were under way on the development of a redundancy scheme for the HSE.  On 25 November 2008, the Minister for Health and Children said she hoped the redundancies would commence in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Having spent three to four years discussing this matter, the Minister announced the scheme yesterday and has given the staff two weeks to reply.  The date set for the receipt of applications is 19 November.  The date by which the redundancies are to take effect is 30 December.  Given that the scheme took three to four years to emerge from the Government, does the Taoiseach think it is realistic to get 4,000 redundancies on a voluntary basis in the HSE, with applications in by 19 November and all done and dusted by 30 December?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_189">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_288">As the Deputy knows, there was already a wider incentivised scheme for early retirement which was taken up by some.  However, it was clearly not as successful as the scheme that is now being suggested.  The latter scheme is arising at a time when the Government is seeking to protect front line services to the greatest possible extent.  Therefore we have an obligation to reduce the cost of delivering those services.  We are bringing forward the voluntary early retirement and redundancy scheme for that purpose for administrative and management grades and, where replacements are not required, for support staff as well.  It has been long mooted that there would be a scheme in place and available and there had been an earlier one.  We wish to proceed on the basis that the Government is providing moneys for this particular scheme during the course of 2010 to effect savings from 2011 on, as has been outlined.  It is a voluntary scheme and it is for people to consider in their own time in the coming few weeks.  I understand there were 900 expressions of interest overnight.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_289">The issue here is not whether there should be voluntary redundancy scheme.  Indeed, this is something the Labour Party has been advocating since the publication of our document on the reform of the HSE as far back as May 2008.  The issue is that having delayed until now to bring forward the scheme, is it practical to have it carried out in this short timeframe?  Some 4,000 staff in any organisation represents quite a large number.  Presumably even if there are 4,000 applications received by 19 November, there will be a process of identifying whether those staff or the posts are surplus to requirements and can be released.  There may well be a process of selection if more than envisaged subscribe to the scheme.  Then there is the process of redeployment of staff because presumably one may have a situation where someone in one particular area might volunteer for redundancy and that job must be filled by someone else.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">The terms outlined yesterday require the applications to be made by 17 November, as has been said, and for people to leave the service on 31 December in order that the moneys provided in this financial year can be disbursed on that basis.  Of course this is a challenging issue for management and employee representatives to deliver but it must be done in the context of the availability of funds during the current financial year.  That this is coming is not a surprise; it has been mooted for some time at these grades and I am sure contingency plans can be put in place.  I accept that it is a challenging timescale but it is one we must meet.  I believe with the spirit of the Croke Park agreement, the facilitation of re-deployment and the fact that these grades have been identified as having some surplus capacity, it should be possible to do this without any major disruption of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">As we have seen with the medical card scheme, the centralisation of services has provided change.

A whole range of people has been involved in the adjudication of eligibility for medical cards.  It is indisputable that centralisation has helped to bring about a situation whereby fewer people are required for the administration of the scheme.  Similarly, there are obvious opportunities here that can be taken up quickly.  Although it cannot be anything to go on by 17 November, the initial response has been quite positive in this respect.</p>

More than half of all staff cut from the HSE in 2009 came from the mental health services despite mental health representing only 9% of the HSE workforce.  Residential conditions in some centres are inhumane.  Some 200 children were admitted to adult centres due to the dearth of appropriate facilities and people with intellectual disabilities are in inappropriate places in psychiatric institutions in large numbers.  There is an urgent need for the Government, at a minimum, to hold funding for mental health at its current level next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">The matter referred to by Deputy Kenny is being examined in thorough detail by the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, who will be reporting to the Government in due course.  It is a matter of high priority for him.  The area is very involved and, as I stated on Question Time last week, the issues arising concern constitutional amendments, for which every word and sentence must be examined, as must every foreseen and unforeseen consequence.  A very long draft proposal was made by the committee and I have commended it for its work on many occasions.  It is the responsibility of Government to ensure we thoroughly examine it and come back to the House for further discussion if necessary.</p>

I also join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in condemning absolutely the assault on the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">In the course of a newspaper interview published on Saturday, the Taoiseach indicated the writ for the Donegal by-election will be moved in the first quarter of next year but he did not commit to holding the by-elections for Dublin South and Waterford on the same day.  Will he clarify if it is his intention to hold the three by-elections on the same day?  There are now four by-elections to hold.  Given what the Taoiseach said to Deputy Kenny, that his mandate and authority derives from this House, I draw his attention to the fact that it now derives from a House that is down four in number.  It is not sustainable to have a situation where Dáil Eireann has its membership depleted by that number for such a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">There has been speculation that the budget day will be earlier than 7 December.  Will the Taoiseach confirm the date of the budget is 7 December?  Given the financial state of the country and the uncertainty in the markets, I am sure he agrees it is not helpful to have uncertainty about the date of the budget.  I invite the Taoiseach to confirm that the budget will be on 7 December.  If not, he should tell the House what date it will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Regarding the wording of the children's referendum, the Taoiseach indicated the Government is considering a new wording.  Is it his intention to refer the new wording to the all-party Oireachtas committee that drafted the original wording and did so much work, as generally acknowledged by the House?  Can he give an indication when the Government will have the wording ready?</p>

Some have not been paid since as far back as last March and many small businesses are being put to the wall.  I have asked the Taoiseach to take action on the matter as the road is in his constituency.  The Minister for Transport is present.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_473">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I am delighted to introduce Second Stage of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010, not least as a former member of the tax strategy group between 1997 and 2002.  The Bill consolidates the law relating to VAT which is contained in the Value-Added Tax Act 1972, as amended.  The VAT Act has been amended in almost every Finance Act since then and was significantly amended by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act 1978.  Furthermore, changes to the Act have also been made by numerous ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The new VAT consolidation Bill continues the successful process of the ongoing consolidation and modernisation of the tax code.  In 1997, the Taxes Consolidation Act consolidated direct taxes legislation dealing with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Following on from this, further tax consolidation took effect with the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003.  It is the Government's intention to modernise and consolidate law relating to customs over the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">VAT is a general, broadly based consumption tax assessed on the value added to the supply of goods and services.  VAT is levied at each stage in the chain of production and distribution.  However, VAT-registered persons can generally reclaim the VAT they have paid.  Therefore, VAT principally affects consumers.  VAT is governed by EU law, was introduced in Ireland in preparation for our joining the EEC and took effect from 1 November 1972.  Prior to this, Ireland had a turnover tax, introduced in 1963, and a wholesale tax.  These taxes were replaced by the new VAT regime, which operated a system of five separate VAT rates.  The number and level of VAT rates applying in Ireland varied substantially throughout the 1970s and 1980s.  In addition, the range of goods and services to which those rates applied were changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The attempt to extend VAT to children's shoes and clothing in the January 1982 budget has entered the political annals.  The amended March 1982 budget introduced by Mr. Ray MacSharry, which applied VAT at point of entry, also took the step of exempting books from VAT, which gave a significant and lasting boost to the Irish publishing industry.  Very high VAT rates, such as the 35% standard rate introduced in the 1983 budget which lasted a couple of years or the opening up of more recent gaps between the Irish and British rates, since closed, have, along with often more important exchange rate differences — I shall put it diplomatically — stimulated cross-Border trade to an extent that was not intended and probably contributed to Newry acquiring city status.  VAT is first and foremost a vitally important source of revenue, but also where margin for discretion exists an instrument of policy.  Arising from agreement at EU level, by 1993 the current system of two VAT rates along with the zero rate came into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">As Deputies will be aware, changes to VAT law at domestic level may only be made within the confines of EU VAT law, which is continually subject to reform.  The most recent extensive revision to the EU VAT code was the recasting of VAT law in the 2006 EU VAT directive, which is the current text that governs VAT within the EU.  In this context, there has been little change in Ireland's VAT rates since 1993 and major VAT changes have generally related to administration, countering fraud and implementing EU provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">In Ireland, as indeed in other EU member states, VAT is a major source of Exchequer revenue.  In Ireland, VAT accounts for around one third of the overall tax yield to the Exchequer, some €10 billion in recent years.  The VAT Act is now substantially different from and more complex than the original 1972 text.  The need for consolidation has been recognised by the Revenue Commissioners and stakeholders for some time.  Earlier plans for consolidation were put on hold, because of significant changes that were ongoing to the VAT code at domestic and EU level, with the 2006 VAT directive recast and the extensive new VAT on property regime introduced in the 2008 Finance Act.  More recently, the VAT code was amended by the ministerial regulations in late 2009, which implemented the EU VAT package that involved significant changes to the rules governing the place of taxation of supplies of services and cross-border refunds within the EU.  However, the time is now opportune to consolidate the VAT code.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The preparatory process for consolidating VAT followed the same rigorous process that was adopted for the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 2003.  The aim at all times was to ensure the most accurate consolidation of the existing law with nothing left out and nothing added.  This is what has been achieved in this Bill.  The Bill was considered by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, and has been duly certified by the Attorney General as a consolidation of existing VAT law.  The Attorney General's certificate was included in the Dáil First Stage motion introducing the Bill on 20 October.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">In preparing the VAT Consolidation Bill, an initial draft of the Bill was placed on Revenue's website for consultation with interested parties and was separately made available to the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Taxation Institute and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies Ireland.  These bodies were afforded an opportunity to submit comments on a draft of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">In regard to the layout of the VAT Consolidation Bill, as stated earlier, Irish VAT law is governed by the EU VAT directive, and, in this context, the provisions of the new VAT Consolidation Bill have been remodeled as far as possible on the VAT directive in order to facilitate better alignment and thereby easier reference to the directive.  To this end, and in preparation for the consolidation exercise, changes were made in recent Finance Acts.  In particular, the Finance Act 2010 reordered the Schedules to the VAT Act, so as to reflect their origins in terms of where the appropriate exemption or reduced rate is permitted under the VAT directive.  The most notable effect of this remodeling exercise is the fact that there are now a much greater number of sections in the Bill.  The 1972 VAT Act as amended contained 44 sections with a number of additional sections inserted throughout the Act.  The new VAT Consolidation Bill contains 125 sections.  This is primarily due to expansive sections in the Act being replaced and clarified by a number of separate sections in the Bill.  For example, the VAT provisions relating to accountable persons in section 8 of the Act have become Part 2 of the Bill, accounting for 15 sections, namely, sections 4 to 18 inclusive.  Furthermore, the use of archaic language in general and of the old-fashioned device of using provisos to change the meaning of a section have also been eliminated in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">To facilitate readers of the Bill, the statutory derivations for the legislation provided for in the Bill are set out in the margin, in the side-note to each section.  These entries show the source of each section in the Bill.  In addition, the memorandum published with the Bill, often referred to as the destination table, sets out the provisions of the 1972 VAT Act in chronological order, and indicates where the provision is located in the new Bill.  If a provision of the VAT Act has not been enacted in the Bill, the memorandum explains why.  The most common reasons for not including a provision in the Bill are that the provision in question has already been repealed, or is unnecessary, where, for example, it might be superfluous.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Bill before the House is the culmination of considerable work.  The greatest benefit which will result from this consolidation will be the restructuring of the VAT code in a more clear, coherent and logical way.  This will make it more accessible and user-friendly for all users, including members of the Oireachtas, businesses, tax practitioners and students of taxation, who have to cope with annual changes to VAT legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I do not intend to go through every section of the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum, which has been published with the Bill, sets out in summary form the purpose of each section of the Bill.  However, I would like to give Deputies some flavour of the overall structure of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Bill contains 125 sections, which are divided into 14 parts.  It also contains eight Schedules.  Part 1 contains the Short Title, defines certain terms, and sets out rules for the construction of certain references used in the Bill.  It also provides for the charge to VAT.  Part 2 contains the provisions relating to persons who are accountable for VAT.  Accountability is a key concept in VAT, as persons who are accountable must register for VAT, submit tax returns and payments, keep records and comply with the provisions of VAT legislation.  The part defines persons who are accountable for VAT by default or election, and persons deemed not to be accountable.  Provision is made for VAT accountability in the case of intra-Community acquisitions of goods; certain services received from abroad; certain services of the State and public bodies and the activities of VAT groups.  This part also provides for reverse charge mechanism in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Part 3 sets out the rules relating to taxable transactions for VAT purposes.  A transaction has to be taxable in order for VAT to apply.  Taxable transactions include the supply of goods, services and intra-Community acquisitions, all of which are defined in Part 3, along with self-supplies, transfers not considered to be supplies, and supplies where there is no consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Part 4 contains the provisions relating to the place of supply rules for goods, services and intra-Community acquisitions, which are central to the operation of VAT.  Provision is made for the supply of goods to unregistered persons, special rules for the place of supply of gas and electricity supplies, and general exceptions to the rules relating to services.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Part 5 contains provisions relating to the amount on which tax is chargeable.  In general, VAT is payable on the full consideration including any ancillary charges made, such as additions for packing, transport, etc, although in some cases open market value may apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Part 6 contains the provisions relating to rates of VAT.  It sets out the rates of VAT that apply in the State, providing rules for composite supplies, and for special rating rules for works of art and contract work.  It also provides that VAT will not be charged on exempted activities, which are set out in Schedule 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Part 7 contains the VAT provisions relating to imported and exported goods.  For VAT purposes, imports are goods brought into Ireland from outside the EU and VAT is normally paid at import.  Exports are goods supplied, subject to a condition that they are to be transported to a place outside the EU and zero-rated for VAT purposes.  In addition, Part 7 provides for temporary importation, the special scheme where exporters can have their inputs zero-rated, and the retail export scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Part 8 provides for VAT deductibility.  An accountable person may deduct the VAT charged on most goods and services that are used for the purpose of their business, where they have appropriate documentation, such as a VAT invoice.  This part also outlines where deductions may not be made as well as situations where deductibility is apportioned.  Provision is also made for the capital goods scheme for property.  A capital good is defined in terms of property that has been developed and related only to persons carrying on a business activity and not to private individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Part 9 provides the rules relating to registration, invoicing, returns and payments of VAT.  It also contains rules on statements required by traders in respect of supplies of goods and services to other member states and provisions in regard to records that must be kept for VAT purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Part 10 sets out the provisions relating to a number of special schemes that are provided for in the VAT Act.  These include the scheme for flat-rate farmers, investment gold, as well as the margin schemes for taxable dealers, travel agents and auctioneers.  Under the margin schemes, suppliers pay VAT on their profit margin in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Part 11 covers VAT rules on property.  Under the new VAT on property system, the first supply of newly developed property is taxable for five years from completion.  The second and subsequent supply is taxable for two years following occupation.  Transitional rules apply for properties that have been developed under the old VAT on property system.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Part 12 deals with refunds and repayments provisions, including ministerial refund orders and refunds to foreign traders.  This includes an electronic refund procedure for businesses operating from other EU member states, and provides for regulations to allow repayment of deductible Irish VAT suffered by non-EU based businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Part 13 sets out the provisions relating to the administration of VAT, including placing VAT under the care and management of Revenue.  Provision is made for estimates, assessments, electronic returns and time limits.  Interest, penalties and appeal provisions are also covered in this part.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Part 14 covers the repeals, transitional and other housekeeping measures needed to bring the VAT Consolidation Act into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Finally, there are eight Schedules to the VAT Consolidation Bill.  Schedules 1 to 3 list the activities that are exempt from VAT, zero-rated and charged at the reduced-rate, respectively.  Schedule 4 lists agricultural activities, and Schedule 5 lists items of art and antiquities, as specified in section 46 of the Bill.  Schedule 6 lists the activities that are within the scope of VAT as required by the EU VAT directive when undertaken by State or public bodies unless the activity is otherwise exempt from VAT.  Schedule 7 makes necessary consequential amendments to references to VAT in other legislation and Schedule 8 lists legislation that is being repealed or revoked as a result of the new Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The Revenue Commissioners are in the process of preparing guidance notes on the VAT Consolidation Act which they will publish as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.  I understand that these notes will also be made available on their website.  For the information of Deputies, the guidance notes will follow the format and style of the guidance notes published in regard to the previous consolidated tax enactments.   I understand that these notes will also be made available on their website.  For the information of Deputies, the guidance notes will follow the format and style of the guidance notes published in relation to the previous consolidated tax enactments.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">With regard to the timetable for passage of the Bill, it is important that the VAT Consolidation Bill is afforded priority, to ensure that it is enacted into law by end November 2010, as any VAT changes made by regulation to implement VAT directive changes, or by financial resolution on budget night, or in the Finance Bill 2011 would invalidate its status as a consolidation Bill.  This would necessitate a recommencement of the consolidation process, create additional work, and delay its implementation unnecessarily until later next year.  For this reason, it is proposed that the Bill be referred to the standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills for consideration next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">A number of motions will be included on the Order Papers of both Houses to comply with the various rules and procedures, as set out in the 2007 Standing Orders for Public Business of Dáil Éireann, to facilitate the timely passage of the Bill.  These motions will facilitate the taking of Committee, Report and Final Stages, and will shorten the minimum periods of time provided for in the Standing Orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">As this is a consolidation Bill, and is so certified by the Attorney General, the effect of the law governing VAT in Ireland will remain unchanged.  No substantive charges are made in the Bill which would change the regulation of VAT.  During its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the only amendments which can be taken on a consolidation Bill such as this are those intended to remove ambiguities and inconsistencies, substitute obsolete or inconvenient language, or achieve uniformity of expression.  Indeed, substantive changes to existing law are not permitted under the consolidation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I would like to place on the record the Minister for Finance's, my own and the Government's appreciation of the amount of work which went into preparation of the Bill.  In particular, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the Parliamentary Counsel's office are to be congratulated on an excellent undertaking.  I commend the Bill to the House, and I look forward to the co-operation of Members in its rapid enactment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_505">I thank the Minister of State for  his introductory remarks and I compliment everybody involved in producing this fine piece of work, in particular the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Parliamentary Counsel and officials of the Department of Finance.  It is a really fine piece of work and follows the excellent work done previously on the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 2003, which were consolidated and introduced here.  It is really a work for stakeholders, professional tax advisers and, indeed, for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It puts the VAT code within a single set of covers and makes it very easily accessible to all of us whose work requires us to have an interest in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I should like to compliment everybody who has been involved in a fine piece of work.  I was going through it earlier and I found it is very accessible.  The explanatory memorandum, which accompanies the Bill, makes it even more accessible because it is in the simplest of English and does not use some of the more arcane expressions one sometimes finds in legislation.  Its accessibility is its principal virtue and I am sure that all those who labour in tax law and in accountancy offices will be very pleased that they can take it from the shelves or look at it on their computer screens, and deal with the information it contains in a ready manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">There is not much more to be said in Parliament about this particular legislation.  As a consolidation Bill it has been certified by the Attorney General as adding nothing to the law and taking nothing away from it as it exists.  Of course we accept that.  It will now proceed, as consolidation Bills do to the select committee on consolidation, of which my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, is a member.  Even under the thorough scrutiny of that committee, the amendments will be confined to matters of drafting, in effect, and no amendments of substance will be appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I do not need to delay the House.  I thank the Minister of State for his explanatory remarks, and again I thank all those who have been involved in bringing forward this consolidation Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I should like to share time with Deputy Arthur Morgan, with the permission of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I, too, on behalf of the Labour Party, welcome this legislation.  As with any consolidation Bill, it is for the purposes of simplifying procedures and that is to be welcomed.  It will potentially reduce the compliance burden on small and family businesses and family farms, and this is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I noted the Minister of State's remarks on the January 1982 budget.  My late father played no small part in that particular decision as regards VAT on children's shoes, so that is a decision which has worked its way into the annals of our family, and we are proud of it.  There is not much to be said, apart from acknowledging it as being a fine body of work.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, instigated by Deputy Ruairí Quinn, had a similar type of effect.  However, the 1997 Act has been amended in every Finance Bill since, and arguably has led to an unwieldy tax system.  One hopes that this legislation will remain as codified and in that sense, retain its purity.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">There is not much more to be said.  We have some amendments in respect of certain parts of the Bill, but nothing substantive.  We shall deal with those on Committee Stage.  We congratulate the Minister, officials of the Department and everyone who had a part in drafting the legislation.  It was no easy task and they are to be commended.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_513">It is a change for the Minister of State and I not to be locked in combat on matters, whether across the floor of this Chamber, or in venues outside.  The Vincent Browne show comes to mind.  Rather, we are dealing with the modernising and consolidation of legislation as regards value added tax, and I very much welcome that.  I accept the Attorney General's verdict completely to the effect that it does what it says on the tin, and neither adds nor takes away from the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I find that almost unfortunate in a way, as someone who represents a Border constituency.  Clearly, the whole differential in the VAT rate on the island is an issue, and I hope that following the consolidation some moves will be made to align or merge the taxation systems.  That would be good for business, generally, and good for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The Bill has eliminated the use of arcane language.  That is wonderful because the Dickensian-type phrasing still being used in some legislation can be somewhat frightening in a modern Parliament.  Hopefully this will set a positive tone for any legislation coming through the Oireachtas.  On a broader note, the whole issue of VAT as a tax tool is very regressive because clearly low and middle income families pay proportionately more as a percentage of their earnings than those on higher incomes.  In that regard I clearly have a problem with VAT as a taxation tool.  It will not happen under this Government, but sooner or later I hope the whole taxation system will be overhauled and modernised.   I am sure the Minister of State would concur with that given the number of levies that have been introduced.  We all know the reason the levies were introduced mid-tax year in the emergency budget in 2009.  A whole series of rates of PRSI were also introduced and these need to be streamlined and modernised and, more important, made fairer.  We need a fairer taxation system in which people can have confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I have strayed a little in terms of this being a consolidation Bill.  However, neither I nor my party have a problem with this Bill and wish it a fair wind through the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I join colleagues on both sides of the House in complimenting the Revenue Commissioners, Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Finance on the preparation of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The history of consolidation of taxation measures dates back to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003.  Anyone who deals with VAT knows the intricacies involved.  Having to reference back to previous years and so on is an onerous task.  I know that practitioners will be delighted when this Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010 comes into force.  The Minister of State can be assured that the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service will expedite its work on the Bill as there are no contentious issues involved and it is not a Bill to which substantive changes can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I note from briefing that this legislation must be enacted prior to introduction of this year's Finance Bill.  It is important that we consolidate taxation measures.  In this regard, the Minister of State might consider having the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 further consolidated given the complications arising in terms of the changes in income tax, corporation tax and, in particular, VAT which is extremely complicated because of our ties to the European scene.  Many of the changes made during recent years have been as a result of directives from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I thank everybody involved in bringing this legislation to this Stage.  The type of language used is more understandable to the ordinary person and those educated in tax matters.  It is time the archaic language previously used was updated and this has been successfully done in this legislation. I congratulate everybody involved in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I join the Minister of State in commending the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_362">
          <from>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_522">When in a moment of weakness the Chief Whip contacted me and asked if I would accept an appointment as a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which is to consider this Bill in detail, I agreed not realising the committee would deal with a Bill consisting of 125 sections and eight Schedules, all of which would have to be teased out and carefully analysed before the committee put its imprimatur on it.  This will not be the first time I have dealt with a consolidation Bill.  I recall, following my election to this House being appointed a member of the committee which dealt with consolidation of social welfare Bills.  It may, therefore, be appropriate for me to deal with this Bill at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Much work done on this Bill to date has been worthwhile.  The work to be done by the committee will be also worthwhile in that it is important that there is complete clarity and certainty in regard to taxation provisions.  There is nowadays a huge obligation on taxpayers to self assess and to make their own returns.  This also applies in respect of VAT, in respect of which penalties apply where people get it wrong.  It is important for those making self assessments that there is clarity in regard to their obligations.  From that point of view, this consolidation Bill will be worthwhile in terms of it being the one central reference point for any such queries.  Currently, there is in place a hotch potch of legislation with the original Act having been amended every year, in some instances twice yearly, since its introduction.  I am happy to work with members of the committee, including Deputies Michael Ahern and Michael McGrath, on this task.  The only consolation is that work on this Bill must be completed by the end of this month.  It will not be an easy task to get through our work on the Bill in time.  It will be three weeks' hard labour.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_525">We will get through this Bill.  While I am not looking forward to the three weeks' hard labour, I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to ensuring the Bill, as requested by the Minister of State, is ready and in place before the end of the month thus enabling it to be enacted by Parliament.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_526">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This is one of only a few occasions when I have been in the House and there has been unanimity and good will towards a Bill.  In that context, the Minister of State is one of the lucky ones.  I do not intend to take away from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">This is important legislation which seeks to clarify and ensure the structures in place are more easily understood.  The Minister of State in his contribution stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_528">The Bill before the House is the culmination of considerable work.  The greatest benefit which will result from this consolidation will be the restructuring of the VAT code in a more clear, coherent and logical way.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">This is important given the difficulties that can arise in regard to such matters.  It is important this legislation is accessible and user-friendly, in particular by small businesses given the amount of red tape in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the fact that a person in financial difficulty who sought to pay his taxes on a weekly basis was able to do so.  Given current technology, it is hard to understand why a person wishing to pay employee taxes, such as PRSI and PAYE — I am not sure about VAT — on a weekly basis cannot be accommodated.  As one who lives on the Border, I am aware that the VAT rates in the different areas of the country are extremely important and I want to highlight the grave difficulties we come across in the entire Border region.  At the time the euro and sterling rates were very close.  We increased our VAT rate by a small amount and, at the same time, the United Kingdom Government increased its rate by a significant amount.  That increased the flow of VAT transactions and business in general across the Border and cost us jobs.  It is difficult to put a figure on how much it cost us in unpaid VAT and other issues because much of the material came across the Border without any issues attaching.  It is important that we try to ensure, even in a very difficult budgetary position, that we do not raise VAT to a level that will force people to go out of the country to shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Minister likes to reflect on history and in his contribution he highlighted Mr. John Bruton's VAT on children's shoes and so on.  That may be interesting but it is very light reading in light of the current economic position in which we find ourselves.  As we come nearer to the time of the budget the Minister of State should be cognisant of the serious implications of VAT in the Border region and I ask him to try to keep it in line.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The second issue may not be directly to do with this Bill but we have a major opportunity to increase the income from tourism and in that regard the levels of VAT being charged in that sector should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">We are trying to encourage alternative energy production yet if I, as a farmer, put up a solid building on my farm I am entitled to reclaim the VAT as a non-registered farmer.  That is the way the system works.  However, if I put up a windmill to provide power for that farm and green energy to go into the grid, I cannot reclaim the VAT in the same way.  That is a major anomaly in the system and if we were serious about alternative energy and maximising our green energy, we must look at those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I was talking to a pig farmer who has a pig unit in County Monaghan and one in Northern Ireland and the differences between the allowances they get North of the Border for producing electricity and the ones we get here are unreal.  If we are serious about alternative energy and maximising green energy we must rectify that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">In general I have no problem with the Bill.  It is the job of my party spokesman on finance to go through the issues with the Minister, and I know he will do that very carefully.  I wish the Minister well with it and I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to say a few words on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">Like all previous speakers I will not necessarily take up my full allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I thank Members on all sides of the House for their welcome and constructive response to this legislation, understanding that the detail has to be teased out in committee.  As Deputy Crawford would be aware, it is the time of year those of us who might have some income from self-employment, in farming for example, tend to pay calls on what we call practitioners in this debate.  Accountancy practices particularly are very grateful for consolidated legislation, which makes reference to it easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I reiterate congratulations on the Bill.  The relative unanimity in the House, at least on the principle of the Bill, does not conceal the fact that an enormous amount of work was put in at an expert, legal and revenue level to putting together this legislation.  We are very grateful for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">To reply to one or two points that were raised in the course of the debate, Deputy Crawford should know that I always find that a little bit of history illuminates every subject.  I try to introduce it in as noncontentious a manner as possible but it is interesting to recall debates over turnover tax.  What happened seemed to have touched the pride of Deputy Sherlock and his family in regard to the 1982 budget but obviously that is not——</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_542">——what we are primarily discussing.  That has a relationship, and I made this point in my opening speech, to economic activity in different sectors.  It is not just revenue raising, even if revenue raising is its principal purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Deputy Morgan and Deputy Crawford referred to cross-Border shopping, and I referred to that in my contribution.  The Central Statistics Office published the results of a survey of cross-Border shopping on 4 December 2009 as part of its quarterly national household survey of quarter two, 2009.  It showed that 16% of households in the Republic made a shopping trip to Northern Ireland in the 12 months to the second quarter, with 41% in the Border area and 21% in Dublin so doing.  Anecdotally I would say the percentage going from Tipperary or Cork would be in the low single figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The cause of the price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic were operating costs, mark-up, taxes and, most importantly, a significant depreciation of sterling against the euro.  That said, VAT rates have a certain headline psychological effect independent of their actual substance or weighting in the difference in prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">There is not more recent data available but the CSO will estimate losses for 2009 and into 2010.  However, the UK standard VAT rate, which had been lowered shortly after we put up the 0.5% in 2008, went from 15% to 17.5% in 2010 and will rise further to 20% on 4 January next.  The gap, therefore, will be nearly closed; it will have been reduced from 6.5 percentage points to one percentage point.  That, combined with a reduction of approximately 20% in alcohol excise duty rates since December 2009, should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">If one goes North of the Border and looks at the prices on the petrol station forecourts they are nominally roughly the same level in sterling as they are in euro, which means, depending on the exchange rate on the particular day, there is probably a 12% or 13% difference between the two.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Deputy Morgan also made the point that VAT, like most forms of indirect taxation, bears more heavily on less well off households.  However, it must be borne in mind that this is the reason that food, drink and children's clothes and shoes, for example, are exempt from VAT.  It is precisely to counter the effect mentioned by the Deputy.  As we know, food in particular constitutes a much larger proportion of spending in poorer households compared to richer ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Deputy Crawford raised the question of VAT refunds on wind turbines for farmers, if I am correct.  Farmers who are registered for VAT are accountable persons for VAT in respect of all their taxable activities, whether those activities consist solely of farming or of farming and other activities such as the generation of electricity for provision to the national grid.  As accountable persons for VAT they are entitled to claim input credit for VAT charged on the installation of alternative energy generators such as wind turbines for use in their taxable activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The real issue is that of farmers who are not registered for VAT.  They are not in the normal course of things entitled to credit for or repayment of VAT incurred by them on their business inputs.  As adverted to by Deputy Crawford, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 25) Order 1993 provides for refunds to unregistered farmers for tax borne on the construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure that is designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business.  While the installation of an alternative energy generator may be the construction of a structure, however, such a structure is not necessarily designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business but, rather, to generate electricity for wherever it is required.  That is the reason the installation of alternative energy generators does not come within the scope of the VAT refund order.  However, I appreciate Deputy Crawford's belief that this should be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">These are all the issues I noted as having been raised.  I thank everyone again for their help in expediting this Stage of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_553">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_554">That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its incompetence in dealing with the banking crisis and, in particular:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_555">the failure of the Government to ensure adequate supervision of the banks;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_556">the failure of the Regulator, Central Bank and the Department of Finance to monitor the banks and provide advance warning of the crisis;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_557">the failure of the Government to act in a timely fashion when banks abroad had collapsed and it was clear that banks here were facing difficulties; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_558">the failure of the Government to change bank directors, to make senior appointments from outside the banks and to change banking culture in dealing with customers;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_559">recognises the widespread public anger that those chiefly responsible for the crisis have not been held to account despite extensive inquiries by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Corporate Enforcement; and calls on the Government to adequately resource the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement to enable them to complete their inquiries as soon as possible so that files may be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and prosecutions taken if appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I propose to share time with Deputies Alan Shatter, Kieran O'Donnell, James Bannon, P.J. Sheehan and Leo Varadkar.  The Government's policy on banking has been an absolute fiasco.  On every step of the road from the misguided guarantee, given under pressure in the last days of September 2008, to the recent decision to wind down Anglo Irish Bank, the policy of the Government has been seriously flawed and has led to ever-increasing estimates of the cost of the bank rescue to the taxpayer.  We started at €1.5 billion on the night of the guarantee, it became €4.5 billion on the day of nationalisation.  Subsequently it became €10 billion, then €18 billion, then €24 billion and has ended up at €32 billion.  The guarantee was flawed and should not have covered Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Since the night of the guarantee in September 2008, Fine Gael has maintained that the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank should have shared in the losses that completely wiped out the shareholders.  The Minister has argued very forcefully that while some discounts could be made in respect of subordinate debt, no discounts could be made in respect of senior debtors, as in law they are the equivalent of depositors.  The Minister claimed he had legal advice to this effect and I presume this is from the Attorney General.  He was as good as his word three weeks ago when he agreed that €7.9 billion be paid to senior Anglo Irish Bank bondholders just three weeks ago without any discount.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The Minister may be interested in a recent editorial in the <i>Financial Times</i> in respect of the new policy of the Government of seeking discounts on Anglo’s subordinated debt.  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_563">It has dawned on the Government that the Irish people should not spare Anglo's creditors the cost of the foolish eagerness with which they funded the bank's real estate punts.  After burning 29 bn of taxpayers money Dublin has found the gumption to let Anglo pick a fight with investors one rank up from the already-wiped-out private shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">In a deathbed conversion, the Minister has realised he can take discounts on subordinate debt held by Anglo Irish Bank.  That is the faint praise in the editorial that damns.  The editorial continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_565">This is why, regrettably we are unlikely to see similar "liability management" for senior debt.  Ireland's leaders remain convinced they cannot force a haircut on senior bank creditors anymore than on depositors or holders of Irish sovereign debt.  They are mistaken.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_566">Senior debt ranks equal to deposits under insolvency rules.  But a government can selectively bail out depositors of an insolvent bank in exchange for their pari passu claims on its estate, as the UK did with Icesave depositors.  The equivalence of private and sovereign debt is a creature of Dublin's imagination — though increasingly one of its making: the government has far too promiscuously expanded its legal guarantees of bank liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">That is an astounding indictment of Government policy and of the Government's legal advice.  It shows this side of the House was correct all the time and that taxpayers have carried an unnecessary burden because the Government did not, would not, and thought it could not, get discounts on senior debt.  That is the view of the <i>Financial Times</i> of the Minister’s actions, of his failure to protect the Irish taxpayer and of his legal advice.  The <i>Financial Times</i> goes to every boardroom in Europe and beyond.  It is a journal of incomparable influence in the financial world.  Is it any wonder there are problems in the bond market and that Irish bonds were being traded up to 7.3% at close of business this afternoon?  Is it any wonder the country is in trouble?  When the question was raised, the Minister assured us he had legal advice to the effect that what the <i>Financial Times</i> is suggesting was impossible and that senior debtholders always had to be treated as equivalent to depositors under Irish law.  According to today’s article, this is not true so I would like the Minister to publish the legal advice he received.  Whatever about the Minister’s reputation, the country’s reputation cannot afford any more damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The failure to protect the taxpayer and to punish recklessness leads us on to another concept much ignored in this country, moral hazard.  This concept is fundamental to capitalism — people and institutions who behave recklessly should not gain from their recklessness but should be punished and be seen to be punished as an example to others who might be tempted to take reckless measures in the future.  This concept was much debated in the United States, which led to Lehman Brothers being allowed to collapse without any attempt to rescue it.  There are different views of what moral hazard should be and some argue that Lehman Brothers should have been saved.  As a concept, it seems to be unknown in Ireland, especially in Irish banking circles.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">AIB has had a scandal in each decade.  It had to be rescued by the State when ICI collapsed in the 1980s; it was exposed as being involved in widespread and systemic tax evasion in the 1990s; in this decade it has become insolvent and the State has been forced to bail it out and acquire 92% of the bank in doing so.  Moral hazard does not stop at AIB.  Anglo Irish Bank has wiped out its shareholders and Bank of Ireland shares were trading at 52 cent yesterday.  That is some hit for those who hold Bank of Ireland shares in their elderly years as a safe place to put money — usually on the advice of bank managers who claimed people would get a better income stream from dividends than from the highest deposit interest available in the banks at the time.  Irish pension funds also put money in bank shares and yet Anglo Irish Bank shares have been wiped out, AIB is practically wiped out and Bank of Ireland shares were trading at 52 cent yesterday.  What do we have in terms of moral hazard?  Despite these disasters, 32 of the directors on whose watch the decisions leading to the collapse of Irish banks and building societies were made are still in position.  The Minister's amendment refers to the directors who have moved on.  What about the 32 who were there for the past two years and held office while this was happening and served on audit and lending committees?  Who are the 32 untouchables left there?  I am not saying they are personally culpable but they presided over the policy that led to the disaster.  The rules of capitalism are that if it happens on one's watch, one is responsible and must take a hit.  No one in Ireland takes a hit for anything. It is a case of "It will be all right".  If we had an honours system in the country, these people would have been knighted five or six years ago.  When people argue about reform of this House and want Ministers to be parachuted into Cabinet without going through the electorate, these are the people who would have ended up in the Cabinet if that facility had been available to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Until very recently the top management at AIB and Bank of Ireland were recruited from insiders.  The culture of the bank has remained the same.  Unreasonable targets are again being set.  Staff are being pushed towards further charges on customers and salary packages are linked to achievement of those targets.  The banks are not providing the stream of credit the economy needs.  The Government is perplexed that the banks are not functioning as intended.  Einstein said the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and to expect a different result.  That is where the Government now finds itself and that is what it is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I hope the inquiries of the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement are speedily concluded and that the files to be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions will have sufficient evidence to support prosecutions.  Why does everything take so long?  There is an old joke that a Mexican tourist in Ireland inquired what word was used here for <i>mañana</i>.  The reply is that we do not have any word that would communicate that sense of urgency.  Two years later the inquiries of the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">How can the Government stand over an appointment to the new banking commission under the Central Bank Act of a person who wants to take Ireland out of the eurozone?  Is that the kind of appointment that inspires confidence in the halls of Brussels, among the bankers in Frankfurt and in the International Monetary Fund?  The Government has appointed someone well known by the media whose first statement as a commissioner is that Ireland should get out of the eurozone.  God help us.  It is time the Government went.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_572">It is right that we consider why we need this motion.  For too long there has been an attitude of "anything goes" in our politics and economy.  We have seen a shocking disregard for the truth by bankers, developers and the Government.  At the heart of our financial, economic, and sovereignty crisis has been a crisis of truthfulness.  This deficit of truth has had a disastrous consequence for our country.  Telling the truth is a critical requirement of a properly functioning economy and of properly functioning politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">At the heart of Government there has been a moral void — a black hole lacking any moral compass.  This was recently graphically depicted by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, first proposing a charge on cash withdrawals from ATM machines and then denying in this House that he had said anything of the sort.  Unfortunately for him, it was all caught out on YouTube.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">We must squarely face the ugly reality that under Fianna Fáil's and the Green Party's watch, there has been a succession of disastrous banking scandals and failures, scandals relating to State agencies such as FÁS and the Health Service Executive, reckless lending, a home mortgage crisis and a fiscal meltdown.  These scandals have happened under the watch of Fianna Fáil-led Governments that have shown an almost sociopathic disregard for the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">For almost 14 years Fianna Fáil-led Governments have acted as the political wing of unprincipled self-serving bankers and avaricious developers.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, led the troops in the charge and the former Minister for Finance, now Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was his financially illiterate sidekick for more than five years.  Many remember the tawdry days of these dons of incompetence in their Galway tent, a tent that had all the dangerous allure for business people of a Don Vito Corleone wedding marquee.  Their distinctive contribution to this Republic was to openly elevate greed in an emporium of reckless financial gambling to a plane where it was the only value in sight in our exploited, betrayed, Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">We have tabled this motion because this feckless Government, which has become a byword for unprincipled politics, incompetency, and financial illiteracy, cannot be trusted.  Their noses were so deep into the trough that it was too late before they realised that they were leading the country in a nose-dive to economic meltdown and financial ruin.  They have breached the principle of government as trust.  Their incompetence has created a debt of up to €50 billion to bail out the banks and an additional debt of €100 billion to date from excessive public expenditure and left decent citizens abandoned and betrayed.  We tabled this motion because this Government cannot be trusted to police the delinquent bankers and builders who were its gilt-edged clientele.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Our country needs a new attitude of responsibility and a Government it can trust.  This has been explained repeatedly by Deputy Kenny, the leader of Fine Gael, with the principled consistency of a leader who puts personal integrity and responsibility first.  We must do the hard work of entrenching a new attitude of responsibility, accountability and more than anything else, a new political morality.  There are specific steps we must take.  Those who criminally exploited Fianna Fáil's era of light-touch regulation to do financial wrong as a highroad to wealth must be punished.  Those who fabricated accounts or who carried out off-the-books or fictitious transactions to misrepresent the true financial position of financial institutions in order to lure others into detrimental deals, should realise that they have written their own tickets to a prison cell.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">It is true that the Government has put a pious emphasis on making wrongdoers answerable before the criminal courts.  Since 2008, when the corpse of the collapsed Anglo Irish Bank had barely cooled, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, solemnly pledged to make gangster bankers answerable.  There have been no prosecutions to publicly vindicate the fundamental importance of truthfulness in the marketplace.  Let us make no bones about it; public trust in the Government to make bankers answerable for their wrongs has collapsed.  Any true commitment to the rule of law demands that we confirm that the powerful are not above the law and that where appropriate criminal prosecutions are initiated expeditiously.  Few in this State believe that those truly responsible for our banking disaster will be brought to justice.  This Parliament, this Dáil, must do all it can to prove them wrong and to ensure any obstacles to justice taking its course constructed by Government are dismantled.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The Garda Commissioner's recent statement in Templemore Garda college indicates that he is aware that there is a growing public mood for the two-year investigation to yield results soon.  He warned, however, that investigating fraud is a complex and time-consuming exercise.  He is right.  He reported that approximately 150,000 e-mails and other communications are being examined, that up to 400 witnesses have been interviewed, and that some witnesses have given statements of up to 150 pages long.  While that is reassuring it is not the point nor is it enough.  I have no doubt the Garda is doing Trojan work.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Speaking also in Templemore, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, dishonestly presented himself as some sort of detached commentator with no responsibility for bad decisions made by the Government of which he is a part.  He said "nobody is more annoyed" than Cabinet Ministers over past banking practices.  He stated: "Unfortunately, outrage and anger is no good in a book of evidence.  What you have to get is hard evidence."  On the issue of the investigation concluding, he said "the sooner the better", but that it is entirely a matter for the appropriate prosecution authorities.  One would think that the Minister was inhabiting the planet Zog at the time when Government supported light-touch regulation and not sitting in Cabinet and bound by collective Cabinet responsibility for the banking disaster, some of the unnecessary expenditure incurred in trying to prop up banks and excessive general public expenditure which is at the root and core of the destruction of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The same Minister should have, but failed to put in place a distinctive, adequately resourced, cohesive, inter-agency unit with a mission to complete the banking investigation expeditiously.  Not only that, but he has failed to clarify the ambit of the investigation.  Some 150,000 e-mails and witnesses' statements of up to 150 pages is a long paper trail.  Any vigilant observer must ask, as I do, whether the paper trail stretches from the head office of Anglo Irish Bank to desks in the Department of Finance or into any other Department?  One must also ask whether the paper trail stretches from the head office of Anglo Irish Bank to any former Financial Regulator or Governor of the Central Bank.  One must further ask whether the paper trail stretches from the desks of the various banks and banking regulators to the desks of the present or previous Taoiseach or any Minister in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Those questions are important.  It is probable that key bankers will offer the defence that any questionable actions they performed were beforehand notified to a regulator, Department or member of Cabinet and were either expressly approved or given the sort of nod or wink for which Fianna Fáil is famous or rather infamous.  The incompetence and deceitfulness of successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments was abetted by inept regulation.  Regulators allowed banks and building societies to lend billions of euro in the face of inadequate collateral without uttering a whimper.  Regulators failed to spot or ignored sharp practices.  Both this and the previous Government, deliberately led regulators to believe that maladministration and looking the other way was the acceptable norm.  The failures of regulation were not accidents.  They were the outcome of the light touch regulation obsession that gripped the Government's Galway tent mindset.  Successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments actively fostered regulatory failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">So we must ask these questions.  Have investigators questioned Deputy Bertie Ahern as a former Taoiseach?  Have they questioned the current Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, regarding his role as Minister for Finance?  Have they interviewed senior civil servants in the Department of Finance?  Have they been able to ascertain the exact state of these people's knowledge of some of the exotic banking and share transactions undertaken that are now subject to investigation?</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The job of Government is to serve the public interest, but it is still failing to do so.  Take a simple example of necessary reform.  We urgently need new legislation to govern the mortgage market.  I will mention three specific reforms.  First, borrowers must be protected from bankers, developers and estate agents who conspire to inflate property prices and to provide excessive mortgage funding for which there is no adequate security.  Second, all brokers or lenders must be required to verify a borrower's reasonable ability to service and discharge a mortgage obtained within the timeframe stipulated.  Third, the law must say that mortgage brokers have a fiduciary relationship with the borrower and an obligation to act in the borrower's best interest and in good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has made an art of entering the House happy to blame others for the Government's incompetence and failings.  Tonight, he should answer the questions asked.  He should tell the House whether the Garda or representatives of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement have interviewed members of the Government and senior civil servants during the course of their two years of investigation, whether all relevant files and papers from the Taoiseach's office and the Department of Finance have been furnished to the Garda, the extent to which the former Financial Regulator and the former Governor of the Central Bank have co-operated with the investigation and whether full co-operation has been received from current and former employees of Anglo Irish Bank and from former board members of that bank, as it is now a State institution.  The Government should publish a draft constitutional amendment to give our Parliament inquisitorial committee powers that are effective and fair so that we can hold people who abuse the financial markets or misuse public funds accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The elemental dishonesty of this financially illiterate Government in respect of the economy is yet again illustrated tonight in the amendment it is proposing to Fine Gael's motion.  Despite all we now know and all the reports published in the past 18 months, it is still so delusional as to claim that all of our economic and banking woes result from "the worst global financial crisis in more than 75 years".  The Taoiseach and his Ministers occupy a parallel fictitious world in which they cannot even acknowledge that their own appointee to Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, a well respected individual, has stated that this crisis is essentially home grown.  The public rightly are no longer willing to tolerate the Government fabricating the facts and covering up its disastrous failures.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The elemental incompetence of this Government and that of its predecessor is evidenced by their monumental waste of taxpayers' hard-earned money, the extent to which the former has mortgaged the future of this and future generations and its complete failure to stimulate growth.  My political colleagues, including Deputies Noonan, Bruton and Varadkar, have needed to remind the Government repeatedly that taxation and cutbacks will not resuscitate the economy and create or save jobs.  No Government has done as much in the history of this benighted Republic to undermine the institutions of this State in the minds of an understandably aggrieved public.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">No one should be fooled by the Government's ducking and weaving and its pathetic attempts to deny responsibility yet again this evening for the catastrophic economic failures with which we are all confronted.  A succession of Fianna Fáil-led Governments have ruled over not the free market, but the greed market.  People outside the House should demand an election and no longer tolerate the sad spectacle of a Government desperately holding onto office by its fingertips, holding onto its cherished Mercs and perks and long past its sell-by date.  To the Independents in the House who continue to support the Government, I say have the courage and the sense of public duty to vote it out.  It no longer has the people's support.  If Independents had any sense of public duty, they would no longer maintain this Government in office.  Indeed, if the Green Party retained any vestige of pride or moral compass and was not so fearful of being held to account by the people, it would also in the public interest end the life of this discredited Government.  It is time that the electorate was afforded an opportunity to elect to Government Fine Gael politicians who can be trusted and who will restore international and domestic confidence in the institutions of this State.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_589">When I have one minute remaining, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might let me know.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I am delighted to support this motion and I will touch on a number of points.  The public are angry.  The national debt has doubled to nearly €100 billion and the banking situation could cost more than €50 billion, €35 billion of which will go into dead banks, namely, Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, and Anglo Irish Bank, neither of which will ever lend or function again.  People are asking how we have reached this point.  The Government and the regulatory system failed the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Going back to when this crisis began, Northern Rock failed roughly around September 2007.  In April 2008, Anglo Irish Bank's share price collapsed.  For a long time prior to the bank guarantee scheme being put in place, the former CEO of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, stated that he had an issue with providing deposits to Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government should have been actively considering putting a bank resolution in place, specifically in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, which will now cost the taxpayer up to €35 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The situation requires that the truth come out.  We are two years down the road since putting the guarantee in place, investigations are ongoing and the Garda Commissioner wants something to happen before the end of the year.  A number of issues, including the resources required by the Garda, must be addressed.  Regarding the back-to-back loans between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, it is incredible that an institution like the latter would give €7 billion to another institution that clearly had problems.  There was no logical financial reason for it.  Was Irish Life &amp; Permanent told to put on the green jersey, as reported by its former CEO?  It was a manipulation of Anglo Irish Bank's money.  The money was routed through Irish Life &amp; Permanent and returned as consumer deposits rather than interbank deposits.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The golden share transaction with Anglo Irish Bank was done by way of contracts for difference.  Effectively, the taxpayer could end up bailing out the cost of the transaction.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">The public's perception that certain people are above the law must be changed.  A bank resolution scheme needs to be introduced.  We have debated it for long enough and it should be in place before Anglo Irish Bank is split into the asset recovery bank and the funding bank.  Measures to tackle reckless trading in financial institutions and banks should be put on a statutory footing so that people who trade recklessly will know that they will be held to account by the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">People are entitled to justice.  Some people cannot repay their mortgages, are worried about the banks foreclosing and are losing their jobs, yet a burden of up to €54 billion is being placed on their backs and the backs of their children and grandchildren.  We need results.  We need to see the Government bringing this situation to finality and providing whatever resources the Garda requires to allow that to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">Reckless lending by banks and reckless spending by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government have made for a sorry state of affairs.  Unfortunately, it is not the Cabinet which is sorry, rather it is the unemployed, the poor, the elderly, the disabled and the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Last week the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated that reckless lending was the core problem of the banks.  However, he failed to mention who had slept on the job of regulating the banks and thereby did not provide the country with advance warning of the crisis that has brought us to our knees.  Essentially, he failed to mention the total mismanagement of our finances by his predecessor, the present Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The only efficiency that has come to light in the last two years is that of this Government which has shamefully manipulated the country's finances and resources to shore up the shameful dealings of its cronies.  The Government is a model of efficiency in this regard.  A whole country has been held to ransom for the good of a number of bankers, developers and speculators, members of the gold circle of cronies, the men of the Galway tent.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">There is huge anger in the country that not one banker or politician has been brought to trial for reckless abandonment of the trust put in them.  Despite a bill, to date, of €2 million there is no expected timescale for convictions and criminal investigations are set to last for years.  It is a nightmare to consider that one third of the staff of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is working on the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank because the matter will drag on and more and more personnel will be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Along with the investigations into reckless banking, it appears it may take more than 60 years to correct the chronic over-development and re-zoning of lands in some parts of the country, including the midlands, a direct consequence of the failure of Government to regulate the planning sector.  On the one hand banks were recklessly lending, while on the other planning permissions were also recklessly handed out because lending and building were tied together.  I refer to the figures for my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, where, combined with figures for counties Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo, housing stock increased by 49.8% between 2002 and 2009, from 90,491 to 135,544 units.  By April 2006, 19% of houses in these counties were vacant but nevertheless 20,500 extra units were built up to 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The amendments tabled to this motion by the Government are at best laughable and at worse a deliberate attempt to deceive.  Like a parrot mindlessly repeating what it has learnt by rote, the Government once again blames the situation on the global financial crisis and follows this with a litany of meaningless justifications for the so-called remedial measures it has taken.  No mention is made of what should have been done prior to the crash but was not.  There is no mention of the collusion with the banks, or of the bank bail-outs which come at the expense of the jobs, health and well-being of our citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">The Deputies on the opposite side will vote down this motion and in doing so will claim this Government provided adequate supervision of the banks.  We all know it did not.  The country knows it did not.  The Deputies believe the regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance monitored the banks so well that adequate advance warning was provided of this crisis and we are now having the soft landing the Government promised us.  The facts of today's crisis, however, prove that is not true.  The Deputies believe this Government acted in a timely fashion when the banks abroad collapsed.  I cannot remember it doing anything until the heads of the banks sneaked into Government buildings after dark in their Mercedes to put a gun to the heads of Ministers and the Irish tax payer.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Deputies want us to believe that this Government has replaced those responsible for leading us into this crisis by making new appointments of directors and other senior staff to run our now nationalised banks, and that the public has faith in them.  The majority of bank directors who were there three years ago are still in place today.  Is that radical change?</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Deputies do not recognise there is any public anger or that those chiefly responsible for the crisis have been held to account, including members of the present Government.  That is a joke.  Not even the 19% who claimed they would vote for this incompetent Government at the next election would believe even one of those arguments, let alone all five.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I have a request to ask those Deputies across the House — of whom, God knows, there are not many present to listen to us.  It seems they have completely reneged on their responsibility.  I ask them to consider their position, as did their former colleague last night.  In order to save this country and prevent further disaster being inflicted on the good people of this country by the worst and most incompetent and corrupt Government in the history of the State I ask them to do the honourable thing, resign their seats and go to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I paraphrase a famous statement.  Never in the history of mankind have so many owed so much because of the actions of so few.  Included among the few is every member of the Cabinet during the past 13 years who was responsible for bringing this country to its knees.  I hold my greatest contempt for those people across the House who still blindly support the most disastrous Government in Irish history.  I appeal to those Members who will vote down this motion tomorrow to consider their position, resign now and cause an immediate general election.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_611">Their presence would be most welcome.  I have three points to make in the time I have.  First, I wish to congratulate Deputies Michael Noonan and Alan Shatter for tabling this motion which I fully endorse.  The motion condemns the failure of the Government to ensure adequate supervision of the banks, the failure of the regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to do their job, the failure of the Government to act in a timely manner when it was clear that a banking crisis was unfolding in Britain and the United States, and the failure of the Government to get rid of the untouchable directors who remain in positions on bank boards despite having being in situ during the banking crisis.  The motion also calls for the Garda, the Office of Corporate Enforcement and the Director of Public Prosecutions to be given the resources they need to bring about prosecutions as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">My second point relates to the Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.  In particular, I wish to ask the Minister and his colleagues if they are prepared to name those bond holders, or, at very least, to confirm names that have been released.  Some Members will be aware of leaks and a British website that was involved in releasing information on the scandals involving MPs' expenses.  Lists have been produced on that website of the Anglo Irish Bank bond holders.  Will the Minister either name them or confirm that the list is accurate?  The Anglo Irish Bank bond holders are the only winners from the bail out of Anglo Irish Bank by the Minister, Deputy Lenihan.  The shareholders lost their money and the customers must pay back the money they owe unless they become bankrupt.  The taxpayers, of course, will be hit with the bill of €25 billion.  Clearly, the bondholders are the major beneficiaries of the Minister's bailout and it is my party's view they should be asked to bear some of the cost of the bank's failure.  That is what would happen if the rules of capitalism were applied.  At very least, the people of Ireland have a right to know who the bondholders are, especially when an alternative to this policy existed.  The bank should have been put into administration and wound down with the cost being shared by the investors and creditors.  There should have been a resolution regime, as Deputy O'Donnell stated.  It is amazing that two years into the banking crisis, or three years later, there still is no resolution legislation in the State.  Perhaps somebody can explain to me why there is no such legislation.  If the Anglo Irish Bank situation were to happen again tomorrow we would have to take the same action, or the Government might end up doing the same thing, simply because there is no resolution regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">My final point relates to the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Nobody doubts the independence of the DPP but to suggest it is entirely up to the DPP to decide whether to prosecute is incorrect.  Article 30.3 of the Constitution provides for the Attorney General to take prosecutions.  The Attorney General sits at the Cabinet table.  I am aware that power was transferred to the DPP under the 1976 Act but that does not mean the Attorney General's constitutional right to take a prosecution has been extinguished.  This view was supported by Mr. Justice Walsh in the Supreme Court decision of the State, Collins <i>v.</i> Ruane in 1984, Irish Reports 105, 118-219, which states that the prosecutorial function of the State can be shared between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions as long as the Oireachtas deems it fit.  If the DPP decides not to prosecute — I would be appalled if that were the case — the Government should at least give consideration to the possibility of initiating a prosecution by the Attorney General.  If the DPP decides not to prosecute — and I would be appalled, in the event — the Government should at least give consideration to the possibility of the Attorney General initiating prosecution.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_628">that the Garda have adequate resources to carry out their work and have no higher priority than completing these investigations;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_629">and the independence of An Garda Síochána and the Director of Corporate Enforcement in their investigations and supports them in bringing those investigations to a conclusion; and notes the intensive work underway within the Government to further strengthen and renew the banks while, and at the same time, ensuring that banks fulfil their commitments given to the Government in relation to lending to Irish households and businesses and, in particular, small and medium sized enterprises."</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The Irish banking system has endured an unprecedented crisis.  The Government has responded forcibly and decisively to this challenging position.  How we continue to manage our collective response to the crisis will affect every Irish citizen now and into the future.  The banking system is fundamental to a strong economy.  The core purpose of a banking and financial system in a modern economy is to contribute to the economic welfare of all citizens by helping borrowers — both households and businesses — to obtain and utilise funding to meet their investment and consumption needs.  A healthy banking system facilitates the most efficient allocation and pricing of risk by paying interest rates on the deposits of savers and by charging rates of interest to borrowers related to the purpose, duration and risk weighting of the loan required.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The Government has commissioned two reports on the banking crisis, The Irish Banking Crisis — Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy 2003-08 by Professor Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank and A Preliminary Report on the Sources of lreland's Banking Crisis by Messrs Regling and Watson.  The findings of both reports were published in June this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Internal safeguards and proper risk management procedures in the banks did not function effectively in the institutions as they should have done.  Some of these matters are under investigation.  All investigations into Anglo Irish Bank are at an advanced stage and are being progressed as a matter of priority.  The matters under investigation are detailed and complex.  The appropriate authorities must be allowed to take the time needed to finalise these investigations.  My understanding is that a large number of personnel from the Garda and the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement are involved in these investigations.  I also understand that the relevant interviews have taken place, or are to take place, as part of this wide-ranging inquiry and that the relevant files are being prepared for submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Garda Commissioner had indicated that a file will be sent to the DPP before the end of the year.  That is how criminal investigations are conducted in this and in neighbouring jurisdictions.  I accept that inquiries on the other side of the Atlantic tend to be much sharper and quicker than they are here.  The nature of our criminal justice system is such that investigations in this jurisdiction — like those in the UK and France — take a substantial period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The Garda has adequate resources to carry out its investigation.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda has no higher priority than completing this investigation.  For his part, the Commissioner regularly meets his officers involved, ensuring that, at all times, they have every resource they require.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I will not comment further on the investigations at this stage.  The House is aware of the independence of An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in carrying out their investigations.  Let us look at the facts.  In response to the weaknesses exposed by the crisis in the structure, systems and staff responsible for financial regulation and supervision, the Government has acted vigorously and effectively.  Professor Honohan was appointed Governor of the Central Bank in September 2009 and Mr. Matthew Elderfield was recruited as head of financial regulation at the bank at the beginning of this year.  The appointment of these two gentlemen has done much to restore public confidence in the Central Bank and in our capacity to regulate and supervise the financial sector.  The Central Bank Reform Act was commenced by the Minister for Finance on 1 October 2010, and the House will be aware of its key provisions.  In addition, new and enhanced accountability and oversight mechanisms have been put in place, including a specific focus of the Central Bank Commission on regulatory performance, including development of performance benchmarks.  Annual performance statements on regulatory performance  must now be prepared by the bank, presented to the Minister for Finance and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is now a statutory requirement for regular international peer reviews of regulatory performance and a committee of the Oireachtas may call the Governor or the heads of functions to be examined on the performance statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The Act provides for a new statutory arrangement to ensure the fitness and probity of persons appointed to high level positions in the management of banks and on their boards.  These are designated as "controlled functions".  Under the new arrangements the Central Bank may prescribe the functions which are controlled functions within certain parameters set out in the Act.  The Act permits a flexible and incremental approach to the prescription of controlled functions so that, for example, it is possible to introduce the fitness and probity provisions in respect of the most urgent functions first, and expand them subsequently to a broader range of functions.  A controlled function relates to the provision of a financial service where the person appointed exercises significant influence on the conduct of the financial service provider's affairs.  People who perform controlled functions are liable to be removed from the performance of those functions in the event that the Central Bank determines that they are not fit and proper persons to perform those functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Last month, the Minister for Finance appointed five members to the Central Bank Commission, namely Mr. Max Watson, Professor John FitzGerald, Mr. Des Geraghty, Mr. Michael Soden and Professor Blanaid Clarke.  The new members serve alongside the Central Bank Commission's <i>ex officio </i>members, who include Governor Honohan, Mr. Elderfield, Mr. Tony Grimes, head of central banking, and Mr. Kevin Cardiff, Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  The new commission members have brought a diversity of knowledge and experience to the Central Bank, drawing from sectors including economics, financial services, social policy, corporate governance and law.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Central Bank Reform Act is an important element in a comprehensive legislative programme.  The new structure of the Central Bank establishes a domestic regulatory framework for financial services that meets Government objectives for the maintenance of the stability of the financial system.  It provides for effective and efficient supervision of financial institutions and markets, and in the future, it will safeguard the interests of consumers and investors.  The new structures will also encourage more responsible and transparent management and lending policies in financial institutions.  The Government will bring forward a second Bill shortly which will provide for the enhancement and adjustment of the regulatory powers and functions of the restructured bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">This Bill will deal with the prudential supervision of individual financial institutions.  It will help strengthen supervision and enforcement and also protect consumer interests and overall stability of the financial system.  This second Bill is of critical importance to the future of the financial services industry in Ireland.  The enhancement of the Central Bank's powers of financial regulation and supervision will be grounded in best practice within the European Union and internationally.  I would like to assure the House that the Central Bank remains fully independent in the discharge of its operational responsibilities.  Taken together, these two items of legislation will ensure that there is appropriate accountability to the Minister for Finance and the Houses of the Oireachtas and greater transparency and co-operation in the exercise of regulatory and supervisory powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">A third Bill will consolidate the existing statutory arrangements for the Central Bank and financial regulation in the State.  Building on the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 — and in response to the regulatory failures identified by the two banking reports — the Central Bank has published its new more assertive approach to banking supervision.  In future, banking supervision will be more intrusive and challenging. Banks will be required to change their behaviour and improve governance, risk management and lending practices.  Under the new regime, the Central Bank will demand decisive follow through by both supervisory staff and supervised institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Specifically, the Central Bank will bring forward initiatives on internal governance requirements; remuneration standards; risk exposures; and standards on credit risk management and valuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The Central Bank has also recently opened consultation on a revised code to strengthen consumer protection.  The revised code requires regulated entities to act in consumers' best interests by ensuring that they know and understand the consumer's needs, sell them products and services that are suitable and provide them with appropriate information to enable them to make an informed choice.  The code also requires firms to have in place an effective complaints handling procedure and sets out a timeframe within which regulated entities must deal with complaints from consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">In addition to the programme of legislation, the Government has progressed a broad range of effective policies to resolve the banking crisis.  The Government's approach has been based on three broad principles; not to let any systemically relevant financial institution fail, this involves protecting depositors and creditors; any State involvement in the financial institutions will protect taxpayers' interests; and to ensure the flow of credit to the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">In formulating the strategic approach to the crisis and developing the detail of individual policies for the banking sector, the Government has taken advice from and consulted with the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and legal and financial advisers. Moreover, it has sought to reflect agreed principles at EU level and to comply with state aid guidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Government has ensured that there is no return to business as usual.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Contrary to the Opposition's motion, significant changes have been made at director and senior executive levels in the covered institutions.  Since September 2008, the chairpersons and chief executives of all of the covered institutions, with the exception of chairman of Irish Life &amp; Permanent and the chief executive of the EBS, have changed.  There has also been a substantial turnover of non-executive directors since 2008.  In total, based on information supplied by the covered institutions, 47 directors have vacated their positions since September 2008 for a variety of reasons and 33 new appointments have been made.  In addition, some 31 senior executives have departed.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Without firm and immediate action to stabilise the banks at an early stage in the crisis, the detail of departures at senior level in the institutions would have been irrelevant.  An early example of the Government's effective response to the crisis was the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme introduced in October 2008.  This scheme provided for a blanket guarantee by Government of the deposits and liabilities of Irish institutions.  It was introduced in the face of clear and present danger to the financial stability of the State at that time.  Had that guarantee not been introduced, it is doubtful whether the economy, let alone the banking system, would have survived.  When the Government made the decision on the guarantee scheme, funding had all but dried up and the banks faced closure within days.  Anyone who doubts the seriousness of the situation should read the recent report of the Governor of the Central Bank, in particular his remarks in the first chapter referring to the discussions that took place on the night of 29 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I accept that Professor Honohan raised in his report the inclusion of dated subordinated debt in the guarantee scheme.  However, as the Minister for Finance has explained to this House, there was on that night simply too much at stake to discriminate between different types of bondholders and in the end those whom the Governor felt should not have been included accounted for just 3% of the covered liabilities.  The Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2010 introduced in September last amended the bank guarantee scheme, known as the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, ELG, which had been in effect since December 2009.  The scheme is now more focused and targeted than was the original guarantee scheme and it is in line with the European model of bank guarantees developed in its wake.  The scheme no longer covers subordinated debt and imposes significantly higher fees on participating institutions for the benefit of a State guarantee of their liabilities.  At the end of June 2010, bank liabilities covered under the ELG scheme stood at €153 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The original guarantee scheme provided a necessary and critical support to banks as other measures to repair and renew the banking system were introduced.  The Government's guiding principle in all its interventions since September 2008 has been to provide a financial system that will serve our industry, businesses and households.</p>

        <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Beverley Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_649">I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is fair to say that the public is extremely angry at what has happened, the roles played by bankers in bringing the country to its knees and the economic crisis we are now going through.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">It is important to say that we on this side of the House are angry too.  The Opposition does not have a monopoly in terms of anger in this respect.  Everyone in the country is outraged at what has happened.  We all want to see anyone who has broken the law brought to justice.  I welcome the recent statement by the Garda Commissioner that the investigation in this regard is receiving the highest priority possible and that he hopes to be able to bring it to a conclusion at the earliest possible opportunity.  It must be recognised that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has informed us that this is the most complex investigation ever undertaken by the State, having dealt with approximately 100,000 documents.  It is hoped that this investigation when complete will result in an outcome which satisfies Members of this House and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">To suggest that nothing has been done in terms of dealing with this situation is completely outrageous, in particular as far as boards of directors of the various banks are concerned.  There has been a huge amount of change in the boards of directors of the covered institutions of which we are speaking tonight.  Some 47 board members who were <i> in situ</i> pre-September 2008 have departed, with 27 remaining.  That is a 64% change in board members, representing a significant change in the past number of years.  In addition, there have been 33 new appointments, including 12 Government nominees.  There has been a huge amount of change across all the boards.  The appointment by Government of two public interest directors to all major covered institutions is an important mechanism in terms of accountability to this House and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I welcome that there is a mix of board members from the domestic and overseas markets.  The Opposition's motion states that there has not been a change of personnel, but it is wrong.  What is more important than a change of personnel across the boards is a change of culture.  It is important there is a change of culture in all of the banking institutions and that the new board members challenge the management structures in terms of the decisions they are making.  That is the only way we will get the type of robust boards across our banking system that we deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, referred to the introduction of the guarantee scheme in 2008.  That guarantee was absolutely essential to ensure the stability of the banking system.  One, if not more, of our banks was close to collapse.  In terms of the protection of deposit holders, it was critically important for confidence in our banking system that the guarantee scheme be introduced.  This has been reflected in the banking reports subsequently published.  The Government introduced NAMA, a work-out vehicle to remove all the development loans from the banks' balance sheets.  That process is working efficiently.  It is hoped that process will be completed by February of next year.  It is through NAMA and the recapitalisation of the banks that we are bringing about stability in our banking system.  We are dealing with a financial crisis that is changing week by week.  Much of what happens is based on confidence.  In this regard, I might add that the role of the Opposition throughout all of this has done more damage to confidence in this country.  It has played no small part in the rising rates we must pay to borrow.  It was suggested by the Opposition that we should default on senior bondholders.  From whom do they think we will secure additional funds when we return to the markets in the new year?</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The reality is that our credibility as a country is at stake.  I support the position taken by the Government.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_655">I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, for his clear statement to the House this evening.  It will be a useful speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">When I read the Opposition's motion, I was unable to determine whether it was referring to the past or the present.  It is not timeframed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has adequately set out the actions taken by Government since 2008.  I want to echo what Deputy Flynn said, namely, that there is no premium on anger.  It is not that Members on that side of the House are angry and we, on the other side, are cold and callous.  We are as incensed as anyone else in the country at the manner in which the various people at the top of the financial institutions behaved.  They have squandered the trust people put in them.  I saw on television last night a clip showing all of the people who attended the Allied Irish Banks special meeting.  I felt sorry for them and do not know what stopped them pelting apples or oranges at the people concerned, even though it was not the man currently in charge who was in place at the time.  Those people lost all of their savings.  The banks took their money and even though they have lost all their savings, they were politely sitting in their seats listening to what Mr. David Hodgkinson was saying.  It was parroted from sections of this and the opposite side of the House that the Government was "in bed" with the bankers and speculators and that it was encouraging this heinous behaviour, which is incorrect.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I, too, wish to see some of them in handcuffs being brought in and out of prison but it will not happen because we have embraced a different justice system here.  Whether one believes the American system is good and ours is not, that is our system of justice and it has served us well.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I heard Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy, say clearly on television last night that they were getting ahead with their business and that there was no word of any shortage of funding to him or to his men to enable them to continue their investigations.  He said he hoped to carry them through to a fruitful end.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I listen to some of the talk shows at the weekend that interviewed some people who have been very much involved in speculation of the wildest nature and they get a great hearing, although not when the e-mails come in.  They want to tell their story but I wonder what is the point of that because it only enrages people further.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I commend the Minister's speech earlier and support the work the Government has undertaken in the past two years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_661">This is a populist motion by the Fine Gael Party, the key to it being that it "recognises the widespread public anger that those chiefly responsible for the crisis have not been held to account" and "calls on the Government to adequately resource the Garda".  There is public anger.  Everybody is angry about the way in which the banking system failed miserably.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Regling and Watson, and Governor Honohan, put the blame squarely on the banks.  Messrs Regling and Watson stated that the primary cause of the banking crisis lies with the banks and their boards.  While mistakes were made in regard to macro-economic policy, the Government has taken the blame for that, principally that counter-cyclical policies were not put in place by the Government during the period from 2000 onwards after we joined the euro up to 2005 to 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The reality is that between January 2003 and January 2007 the total outstanding credit from the banks here increased from €160 billion in 2003 to €380 billion in 2007.  That was an increase of €220 billion of outstanding credit from the banks.  That is the cause of the crisis.  We can put whatever connotation we want on it but that is what led to the difficulty we have today.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">One of the interesting points made by Regling and Watson was that there was not the kind of expertise available to deal with the situation that was occurring.  I did not see anybody——</p>

          <p eId="para_678">This motion and the contributions from the other side of the House go back to the accusations made in the past two years, specifically with regard to the bank guarantee scheme.  The credit institutions support scheme introduced in 2008 provided for a blanket guarantee of the deposits and liabilities of Irish institutions.  Without that guarantee, the banking system would have collapsed.  As the Governor of the Central Bank said in his report on the banking crisis, "An extensive guarantee needed to be put in place".  Otherwise, our banks would have run out of money within a matter of days and "would have had to close their doors".  The Governor went on to state: "Closure of all, or a large part, of the banking system would have entailed a catastrophic immediate and sustained economy-wide disruption..."</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The bank guarantee provided breathing space to allow necessary measures to fix the banking system be introduced.  That included NAMA, the bank recapitalisation, reform of the Central Bank and a new Financial Regulator put in place, and the ongoing restructuring of the individual institutions.  As all Members are aware, attracting funding remains difficult for the banks, not least in light of the stress in sovereign debt markets.  It is also important to point out that about a dozen other European Union countries also recently extended their bank guarantee schemes to 31 December.  They include countries such as Austria, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Spain and Sweden.  It is also important to note also that the State has already earned more than €1 billion from guarantee fees in less than two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Messrs Klaus Regling and Max Watson, in their report, questioned the fiscal and macro-economic policy of the Government but they went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_681">. . . that bank governance and risk management were weak — in some cases disastrously so.  This contributed to the crisis through several channels.  Credit risk controls failed to prevent severe concentrations in lending on property — including notably on commercial property — as well as high exposures to individual borrowers and a serious overdependence on wholesale funding.  It appears that internal procedures were overridden, sometimes systematically.  The systemic impact of the governance issues crystallised dramatically with the Government statements that accompanied the nationalisation of [Irish banking].</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It has been stated also that the Government has done nothing in recent years to face up to the problem but that is untrue.  The creation of a fully integrated Central Bank has been announced.  That was recommended in the FRS report of the then finance committee in the 1997-2002 period.  We recommended that to the House.  It was an outside report which recommended breaking up that body.  The wisdom of the House was correct on that occasion.  Deputy Noonan was the spokesperson on finance at the time and I was chairman of the committee at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">There has also been the replacement of the board of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator with a new Central Bank Commission chaired by the Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan.  Mr. Matthew Elderfíeld was appointed as Head of Financial Regulation, and has been doing tremendous work since he took up office.  There has also been provision on a statutory basis for a new regime of fitness and probity for senior management and board members in banks and other financial service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">A total of 60% of the members of the boards of the banks have vacated their positions.  It is often put forward that there have been no changes in that area but it is clear from the facts that there has been change.  Regarding what has been done to make the people answer for what they have been doing in the banks, the Garda Síochána and the Director of Corporate Enforcement have been doing extensive work in that area and from the statement of the Garda Commissioner in recent days it is hoped that work will come to an end in the near future and will go to assuage the anger that exists, and rightly so, among the public.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_687">Yes, tomorrow evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Recent revelations have added massively to the cost and uncertainty surrounding Fianna Fáil's bailout of its pals, the bankers and developers.  So badly has Fianna Fáil's blanket guarantee turned out that the interest rate on Irish bonds, as we have seen today, is now well over 7%.  If we stay at this rate, our national debt will double in ten years.  We are on an upward escalator the size of Mount Everest.  Although ordinary Irish people are taking tremendous hits in terms of cuts in services, extra taxation, pension levies and so on, the amount involved does not come near the actual increase in interest costs that Fianna Fáil and its disastrous mismanagement of the bank bailout and guarantee have brought down on the heads of the unfortunate citizens of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">There are two major contributors to the cost of the bailout, as mentioned in the recent announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The bailout IOUs, or promissory notes, give rise to super-sized interest payments, adding at least €1.7 billion to the deficit in 2011, which means that higher taxes and harsher cuts will be needed to meet deficit targets.  Many people have been surprised by the rise in the deficit from €7.5 billion to €15 billion.  The answer is simple.  Most of it — almost all of it — relates to higher interest costs, particularly with regard to promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  When he announced this last Easter, the Minister seemed to think there would be no interest charge at all, or else he did not tell us about it.  Thus, either he was stupid — which I do not think he is — or he exercised his discretion and did not share his knowledge with the plain people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">In addition, the Government has agreed to buy all shares in the AIB rights issue at a price of 50 cent — as announced on black Thursday — even though the shares are trading on the open market at about 35 cent.  This reminds me of the purchase of Farmleigh by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in his salad days.  It was on offer on the open market at €15 million, but by the time he managed to acquire it the cost, believe it or not, had risen to well over €20 million.  AIB shares cost 33 cent, yet the poor unfortunate taxpayer will pay 50 cent per share for them.  Of the total €5.4 billion rights issue, upwards of €1.6 billion will be a straight gift to existing AIB shareholders, including the many who took a punt on those shares — hedge funds and private equity funds — when they were floating at the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Bankers have treated taxpayers as doormats.  It is a case of all take and no give.  It is time this balance was redressed and the banking sector made to contribute to the cost of cleaning up its own mess and preventing a similar mess in the future.  There are two options I will recommend to the Government in this regard.  The first is to provide that 100%, rather than 50%, of the cost of financial regulation be covered by the industry, which will result in savings of about €30 million per year, or €150 million over five years.  At the moment, the banks, financial institutions and insurance companies pay half the cost of regulation, with the State paying the other half, which runs to about €30 million per year at present.  Why should the industry not pay for all of this?  Why should the banks and financial institutions not also pay the cost of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement?  It is the least they could do, given the billions of euro we have poured into them.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The second recommendation, which would require a little courage and engagement by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, is to campaign for an EU-level financial transaction tax on speculative transactions in derivatives and other types of financial product.  Believe it or not, this would raise €1 billion to €2 billion per annum for the Irish Exchequer.  However, it could only be done on an EU-wide basis, and therefore our Government should lobby for the introduction of such a tax in the EU.  It would help to curb speculation and to document transactions, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The Taoiseach shed some light on how Ireland is to pay down the IOUs incurred in bailing out Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and EBS when he described the promissory notes — a cool €31 billion — as being akin to paying a mortgage.  This is a €31 billion mortgage on Irish households for the sake of Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide and, in a small way, the EBS.  To date, the Minister for Finance has issued €18.88 billion in promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank, with the issue of a further €6.4 billion to take place before the end of the year.  A promissory note for €2.6 billion has been issued to Irish Nationwide Building Society, but the Minister has indicated that this will very soon increase by a further €2.7 billion.  A smaller promissory note, amounting to a mere €0.25 billion, has been issued to EBS.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">These IOUs will total €31 billion by the end of 2010, but that is not the end of the story.  The interest rate on the promissory notes will average around 5%, because the interest rate on the day the note is issued is applied.  With repayments totalling €3 billion per annum, the total interest charge will add a further €10 billion to €14 billion to the final bill for bailing out the banks.  The Minister for Finance must come clean on the interest rate, the term, the annual cost and the total overall cost of paying off these IOUs.  We need to see the small print of the "mortgage agreement" which the Minister has signed the country up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The use of the word "mortgage" by the Taoiseach in the Dáil confirms the Labour Party's view that these IOUs will generate large annual interest payments in the budget every year for the next ten to 15 years.  This makes the target of a 3% deficit by 2014 more challenging and will result in more tax hikes and spending cuts in the Government's four-year plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">On 8 October, I tabled a parliamentary question on the proposed rights issue to recapitalise AIB.  I was concerned that this €5.4 billion transaction, which is to be underwritten by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, could involve an immediate and significant write-down on taxpayers' investment.  In his reply to me on 14 October, the Minister confirmed to me that he intends for the rights issue to go ahead at a price of 50 cent, even though the market price has ranged between 30 cent and 40 cent in recent weeks.  In the topsy-turvy world of Alice in Wonderland, when, in a market-driven transaction such as this, would one pay 50 cent for a share that is currently trading at 33 cent, with an average of between 30 cent and 40 cent?  It is customary for shares to be offered at a discount; instead, the State is taking them on at a premium, which will result in a further loss of €1.6 billion in the State's investment in the NPRF, because the share values will be diluted.  The net beneficiaries of Fianna Fáil's largesse will be existing AIB shareholders, particularly bottom-feeders who bought when the shares were very low — including hedge funds and private equity funds — whose investments will not now be diluted as much as they would have been.  A further €1.6 billion gift to punters on bank shares may not sound like a large amount to those in the Department of Finance in the context of an overall bailout cost of well over €50 billion, but to put this in context, €1.6 billion is approximately one third of the total budget cuts and tax rises Fianna Fáil has in store in the December budget.  The cause is the blanket guarantee that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and even Sinn Féin passed in these Houses in September 2008.  Had we avoided the blanket guarantee, we could have probably avoided tens of billions of euro in losses that now lie on the backs of the taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">We must make the bankers pay for the crisis.  Even if it takes 100 years as far as I am concerned and as far as the Labour Party is concerned, we will get every cent these bankers have swallowed and that Fianna Fáil has given its cronies in the banks.  When these people move away from being in government, we will produce a serious programme for reform and corporate governance that will end the cosy old boys' club that exists between Fianna Fáil, the developers and the bankers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_698">I thank Deputy Burton for sharing her time with me.  I support the Fine Gael motion, which Deputy Fahey described as populist.  I wonder why it is popular for people to want to hold these bankers to account.  I must be leading a sad life because recently I started to listen carefully to Fianna Fáil speeches, which I regard as dangerous.  This evening I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, was doing particularly well.  It was a very technical statement almost devoid of saying anything except what some Garda Commissioner or some other person might have said in the past with very little reference to the Fianna Fáil backroom team.  However, he eventually made a bit of a slip when he said: "On the night of 29 September 2008, there simply was too much at stake to discriminate between different types of bondholders and in the end, those whom the Governor felt should not have been included accounted for just 3% of the covered liabilities."  So the Minister of State believes it is not a big deal at all even though that 3% amounts to €5 billion.  However, on 7 December the Government will rip off the people of this State to the tune of €5 billion in what will probably be the worst budget ever.  While it apparently has to be done for the greater good, the Government regards the 3% as pocket change and we should not be excited about such a meaningless amount.  However, if it had done its homework properly on 29 September 2008 and shared honestly with this House what the situation really was, then the State would be €5 billion richer, but that is not the case because of gross incompetence on the part of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">It is a pity I cannot hear that character when he talks because I would like to respond to him.  It is a pity that whoever was given the job of crafting the statement was not given the job of crafting the amendment.  The person or people who crafted the amendment to the Fine Gael motion obviously were in old mode and less competent than those who crafted the Minister of State's speech because the amendment commends the Government on "the rapid and effective response it has made to reform the structures of financial regulation, support the banks, restore confidence..."  Whoever might be replying to the debate should tell us in whom the confidence has been restored because the report on the front of today's <i> Financial Times</i> and the interest rate of 7.24% on international bond markets today hardly suggest confidence.  The confidence is certainly not restored in anyone in whom it should be restored and certainly not to the people.  It has not even been restored to Government backbenchers; one has stepped away and more may follow, which does not suggest confidence in the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The amendment also refers to "ensuring that banks fulfil their commitments given to the Government in relation to lending to Irish households and businesses and, in particular, small and medium sized enterprises".  However, that is simply not happening.  Through their work in their constituencies, all Deputies know that small businesses are screaming out for support from the banks, but are not getting it.  Overdrafts and term loans are simply not being extended to small businesses which means that the very backbone of the economy on which we will depend to find our way out of this economic mess is being wiped out.  Really someone should have a chat with whoever crafted this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">While we know a number of inquiries are going on, who is inquiring into the activities of the auditors of these banks?  Ernst &amp; Young were the auditors for Anglo Irish Bank.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the figures from the 2008 accounts audited by Ernst &amp; Young, which indicated a profit of €784 million, but a few months later we were told it was a €12.7 billion loss.  I must correct the record; of course there is an investigation going on into the auditors, but the auditors are investigating themselves.  I am sure that will be a very fruitful investigation and I can tell the House now what the results will be, and it certainly will not be very heartening for the taxpayers who will need to carry the can for these characters.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I will return to the bank shortly, but before I do I want to address the other side of the Fine Gael motion, which deals——</p>

          <p eId="para_710">That is what I meant; I do not have much time to deal with the matters I would have like to have covered.  There needs to be greater efficiency in the Garda.  There are gardaí hanging around courthouses waiting for cases to be called when the DPP knows that those cases are not likely to be taken that day and in some cases knows definitely that they will not be taken that day, leading to substantial time being wasted.  We need to get gardaí out from behind the desk doing silly things like answering phones, which is a telephonist's job.  Highly trained police officers should be doing the job for which they are trained rather than wasting time answering the phone.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I am somewhat concerned about the work of CAB, which appears to be used increasingly as a revenue raising agency.  While I do not disagree with the work it is doing and welcome it, I wonder whether there are bigger fish to fry.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Let me finish with bank regulation.  The Government claims it has done great things, but for the past three sessions the list of promised legislation has contained the Bills for the financial regulatory reform.  On the publication of the Central Bank Reform Bill in March, I met Department of Finance officials and was told that the second and third parts of this three-stage legislative programme would be almost finished by the end of 2010.  The briefing document provided by the officials stated that the text of the second Bill would be available early in autumn, but now we are told that publication of the final two Bills is not expected until 2011.  Why is financial regulation being dragged out?  Why is it not all wrapped up and done and dealt with?  The code has not even been published yet and we are supposed to have a consultation on it, which means it will not be introduced until sometime in the second half of next year.  According to the Government's amendment and to the contributions from Members on the Government side all of the legislation on bank regulation is supposed to be urgent, but there is no sign of it.  I wonder why it is being delayed and dragged out, and I am concerned about the message that sends to the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">It is a pity I could not deal with the issue of directors and the cliques who remain in place.  We need more time to deal with those characters and I hope we get an opportunity in the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas McEllistrim</from>
            <p eId="para_714">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">As business is the engine that keeps the country running and drives the local and national economy, perhaps it is time that we considered the enhanced fostering of entrepreneurship in schools and its gradual development as a formal subject.  I recently received correspondence from a young and enthusiastic secondary teacher who, after involvement in the young entrepreneur programme, YEP, in County Kerry became convinced that entrepreneurship should become a subject at second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">As part of the programme, students at both second and third level come up with a business idea, research it and submit a comprehensive business plan.  Following assessment and shortlisting, they must pitch their business idea to a panel of business people who decide on 12 finalists.  They then go forward to the final where they make a concluding pitch and face questions from a panel of nationally recognised experts.  The winner is later announced at a gala evening attended by all — students, teachers, mentors and organisers.  The YEP and similar projects in other parts of the country demonstrate the huge potential of students.  Those who did not study business but who recognised gaps in the market excelled in making business plans.  Many students completing the programme have a business plan for potentially viable business ventures.  The experience gained in the programme arms students with the tools to better themselves and their communities.  The skills learned will stand to them in whatever careers they choose.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">The global economic downturn has led to a focus on the need for job creation and competitiveness to stimulate the economy into recovery.  Large scale businesses and multinationals across the country are important in providing jobs but so too are the small and medium enterprises scattered across every county.  The fostering of entrepreneurship in our young people, through education, is the way forward.  Given the right stimulation and support, their initiative and perception could lead to the innovation needed to create new opportunities for business and for jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">Traditional enterprise programmes tend to teach the theoretical side of enterprise and the formulation of business plans but there is also a need to be more hands-on and practical in our approach.  Making the programme examinable would give it greater credence and put the emphasis on the student taking control of their own learning.  The involvement of the wider community will allow the students to derive practical knowledge from the learning pool of local established ventures through work placement and mentoring components.  Students will gain self-esteem and confidence, improving their ability to research and improving their interpersonal skills, information communication technology skills, problem solving skills, accountancy and economic skills and responsibility, adaptability and independent learning.  These are all important skills not only in business but in life.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">Regardless of whether these students take up a career in business, these skills and a can-do spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation will stay with them in any future career they choose.  It is a win-win situation.  The aims and objectives of promoting entrepreneurship in schools would allow our young people the prospect of becoming self-reliant on their own initiatives, teach them how to develop their business plans, give them the necessary tools to implement their business ideas and encompass the wider community collectively in stimulating economic growth through the implementation of business ideas through to start-up businesses.  It would ignite young people's passion and pride in their country and, therefore, the motivation to develop the indigenous industries that make their country economically sound.  It would also foster a positive attitude and understanding of all aspects of business and promote maturity in all aspects of life, personally and socially.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">The fostering of entrepreneurship would involve a coalition of partners in which each partner would be a cog in the wheel of success.  Each would serve different functions and roles, ultimately achieving the same goal, which is to bring entrepreneurship to life, to bring to students an understanding of the business world and, potentially, to bring their ideas to a successful conclusion, that is, a profitable enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">I understand there would be major practicalities involved in expanding these projects into leaving certificate subjects and considerable research and development would have to be done in advance.  However, a review of current entrepreneurship projects in various parts of the country would be an excellent place to start.  The Department could investigate why they were successful, what is to be learned from good practice, what could be improved, how the local business and school communities interacted and the dividend both for community and students involved.  At the very least, projects such as YEP should be expanded and supported throughout the State.  Business will drive our country forward and out of recession.  Mol an óige and tiocfaidh sé.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_722">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I welcome this opportunity to outline the position on entrepreneurship in schools.  At a European level, the EU Commission has identified enterprise as one of eight key competences all students should have by the end of second level education.  The Commission defines enterprise as being able to make change happen, as well as being able to support and adapt to change, taking responsibility for ideas, settingobjectives and meeting them, and being motivated to succeed.  My Department supports enterprise in schools through the development of core skills in the curriculum such as literacy and numeracy, ICT, higher order thinking and problem solving; ensuring an appropriate basket of competences in junior and senior cycles; and specific programmes in enterprise in senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">One of the principles underpinning the primary school curriculum is that the child's higher order thinking and problem solving skills are developed.  Through the curriculum, the child is encouraged to observe, to ask relevant questions, to recognise the essence of a problem, to suggest solutions and to make informed judgments.  These skills are fundamental to engendering enterprise in our young people.  At junior cycle level, an enterprise culture is promoted by ensuring an appropriate range of competences through a broadly based programme encouraging investigative approaches and offering science, ICT, languages, technology and a range of academic and practical subjects.  These offer a foundation for active citizenship and lifelong learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">In senior cycle students taking the transition year option, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills.  These programmes place a strong focus on active learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork.  Students also engage in work experience.  As part of transition year, which is now taken by 50% of students, Mini-company is among the range of options supported.  Mini-company is a tuition programme and class activity undertaken over the period of the transition year.  After generating the business idea, the company is set up and registered, different students assume the roles of different actors in the company — chief executive officer, production manager, human resources, industrial relations, finance, etc.  The same process is gone through leading to the production of the product or service, the accounts, the business report, and also the winding down of the company, and the presentation and interview process.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">Enterprise education and preparation for work are the link modules which form an explicit part of the curriculum within the leaving certificate vocational programme.  In the leaving certificate examination this year, the link modules were taken by 15,596 candidates.  The enterprise dimension of the programme is designed to give students the opportunity to meet enterprising people and investigate business and community enterprises.  As part of the modules, students are encouraged to set up their own enterprise projects as vehicles of learning at home, in a school, in the community or in business.  The vocational preparation and training aspects of the leaving certificate applied, taken by 3,358 students in 2010, also include enterprise and work experience dimensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The leaving certificate business syllabus has a strong focus on enterprise.  The syllabus is designed to provide a clear understanding of the role of enterprise and to develop in students a positive and ethical attitude to enterprise in personal, business and public life.  The syllabus covers the relationships of people in a business environment; handling conflict; identifying, marketing and starting a business; the domestic and international environment; entrepreneurs and enterprise skills; and their application to different situations.  In the leaving certificate in 2010, some 18,790 students sat business.  It will be seen, therefore, that enterprise is an intrinsic part of the curriculum in senior cycle supported by continuing professional development programmes and resources for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">The county and city enterprise boards organise a student enterprise award scheme in second level schools and Youthreach centres.  Students are required to generate the business idea, research it, undertake a risk assessment, produce the product or service, market it, prepare costings and accounts and a business report.  In 2009 for the first time, the top three winners of the transition year mini-company "Get Up and Go" competition and the CEB student enterprise awards were presented with the Seán Lemass award for enterprise by the Taoiseach.  There was also media coverage, including on "The Late Late Show", of businesses developed by students in the competitions.  This was the first year of the Seán Lemass award and it reflects a commitment in the Government strategy "Building Ireland's Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal" to raise the profile of these competitions and encourage more second level students to participate in enterprise programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">Enterprise does not relate only to setting up a business and there are other examples across the school system which promote the skills which underpin an enterprise culture.  Young Social Innovators is an initiative to promote social awareness among students and is available for schools providing the transition year programme.  The students are encouraged to identify a social issue, research it and engage in an action plan to promote change.  The skills of teamwork, research, planning, evaluation, critical reflection and active citizenship are developed.  The results are showcased in an annual exhibition and award scheme.  Some of the projects can result in social enterprises being explored.  Some 6,000 students annually take part.  The Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, now the largest and longest running exhibition of its kind in Europe, is another example of the innovation and creativity which is being fostered and promoted in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">In addition to the above, a variety of voluntary and other agencies have been promoting links between schools and business, either in the form of junior achievement or the business in the community schools business partnership programme concentrating on schools serving disadvantaged communities.  This work is also supported extensively through the county enterprise boards and chambers of commerce.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">We are continuing to promote key skills and active learning as part of ongoing curriculum reform.  The junior cycle review currently under way will present new opportunities to strengthen these skills and promote enterprise, creativity and innovation in our schools.</p>

            <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
            <p eId="para_733">I wish to raise the important issue of NAMA and its efforts to date in pursuing developers who owe money to the agency, particularly focusing on the foreclosure of bankrupt developers.  I raise this matter having already submitted a parliamentary question to the Department of Finance, to which the response from the Minister was less than satisfactory.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">As far back as 13 April, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, the CEO of NAMA, appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service and made estimates and projections for how and when bankrupt developers and unco-operative developers would be pursued.  At that point, Mr. McDonagh stated that NAMA would start to foreclose on bankrupt developers by September, after assessing how they intended to deal with their debts.  He clearly stated at that meeting that NAMA would take a strong view and would apply a zero value to developers' personal guarantees when considering loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">The disappointing aspect of all of this is that, to date, NAMA has worked on 12 potential cases where legal action is being taken against some of these people.  So far, as matters have proceeded through the Commercial Court, it has been clear that NAMA has been ineffectual and ill prepared when dealing with these cases.  For example, on 18 October, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly criticised what he described as the sloppy and careless manner in which legal proceedings were being brought by the various banks in efforts to recover multimillion euro debts.  He noted that in one case taken by Anglo Irish Bank, the bank's legal team sued for €3 million, as opposed to the €9 million owed.  It is clear that the banks in their proceedings in the Commercial Court, along with NAMA in its failure to progress matters through the legal system, are failing in their duty.  There is a significant duty of care now to the taxpayer, who has pumped billions of euro into Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and AIB, and there should be some return for this in terms of reckless developers being pursued to ensure they do not get off scot free.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">It is puzzling to the public that one developer could be heard on an RTE radio programme on Saturday talking about the salary he could expect to receive from NAMA.  As we know, NAMA has not even set a cap on the fees that will be paid to developers.  This grates with people because they do not understand why salaries are being paid to developers who were reckless by their own admission and why those fees have not had a maximum level put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">There have been delays in identifying properties that have been transferred into the names of developers' spouses.  There are lists of properties that have been identified in the national press owned by developers where substantial assets worth up to €2 million have been transferred since 2008 into the names of the developers' spouses.  When properties have been transferred within the five years, NAMA is well within its rights to set aside those transferrals.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">I hope there will be a more detailed answer from the other side of the House than was the case in response to my parliamentary question.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_415" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_739">NAMA has made significant progress in the ten months since its establishment last December.  In its second quarterly report, released earlier today, NAMA recorded a profit of €6 million in the three months to the end of June 2010.  The report also illustrates that loans are continuing to transfer on schedule to NAMA, which in turn has begun to directly manage those loans for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">NAMA advises that it is currently engaging directly with some 30 debtors.  As their loans are acquired by NAMA, debtors are being asked to produce business plans which will set out detailed and credible targets for reducing their debt.  It is not an option for debtors to survive on taxpayer-funded life support until the market improves; a debtor must set out how he plans to reduce his debt significantly over a three to five year horizon.  For most debtors this means identifying assets which can be sold to raise cash which will be used to repay debt.  NAMA will endeavour to work with debtors where this is a commercially feasible option.  It will work with debtors who are co-operative, in asset funding and in the lifestyle implications for them.  The agency will also work with debtors who can prove they possess the will and the managerial capacity to deliver on targets.  In cases where they cannot do so, the only option will be foreclosure.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">NAMA expects the property underlying the loans it acquires will be worth about half of the amount advanced by banks.  That is the most that NAMA could notionally recover today if it foreclosed on all debtors.  The market, however, is in no condition to absorb a large volume of property sales currently.  NAMA's best interest, therefore, is served by working with debtors, where possible, to enable them to improve their capacity to repay their debts.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The coming months will be pivotal for NAMA in its key decisions on the viability of individual debtors.  The agency will seek to optimise the income it can extract from loan portfolios.  Part of that involves ensuring debtors pay to NAMA all of their available cash flows in circumstances where they are unable to fully meet their current interest repayment obligations.  While it may be seen as an obvious step, NAMA is discovering it was not, by any means, the universal practice among financial institutions to secure asset cash flows for purposes of debt repayment.  Other options available to NAMA include debt rescheduling, loan restructuring and the potential sale or assignment of loans or loan portfolios to third parties.  This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and the decision will be dictated by commercial criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">Inevitably, it will be necessary to foreclose on debtors incapable of managing the burden they have taken on.  Accordingly, NAMA will become more the manager of a portfolio of property assets.  To date, NAMA has approved enforcement action on 15 debtors.  Not all of this will lead to actual enforcement, as the experience so far has been that debtors begin to co-operate when faced with actual enforcement.  In cases in which NAMA will enforce, it will have to pursue the normal avenues through the courts in Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">Banks and debtors are enduring significant pain as part of the current process — the banks through the write-downs they must accept on the sale of their loans to NAMA; debtors, through loss of their equity.  NAMA has advised it is well placed to break even, or do better, on behalf of the taxpayer.  The agency will pay no more than a realistic price for the loans it acquires and has the advantage of time to extract optimal value from the loans and from any property it may acquire through foreclosure.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">While not directly related to this Adjournment matter, it should be noted that NAMA yesterday was successful in facing down the first significant legal challenge it encountered with a comprehensive ruling in its favour in the High Court.  There should be no doubt that the agency will pursue developers who owe money to it and foreclose on bankrupt developers where this is the best course of action to take.</p>

          <heading>Garda Stations</heading>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_416">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_746">The Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Garda Commissioner, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local Garda management all agree the current site for Tralee's Garda station is not suitable for a divisional headquarters or appropriate to the policing demands of the Tralee district and Kerry division.  For eight years, several new sites have been considered but have been found not to be suitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">A site at Ballymullen Barracks was identified and considered the most appropriate for several reasons.  It was also proposed to move the local driving test centre and part of the Courts Service to the Ballymullen site.  Negotiations to ensure the transfer of the site to the Office of Public Works have been under way for some time with the Department of Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">While the site is not required by the Department for future purposes, it seems not to be prepared to pass it on free of charge to the OPW but insists on receiving the current value for it.  The OPW is not prepared to exchange money for a site it believes is State property and will remain in State ownership if developed as a divisional Garda headquarters.  Transfer of the site free of charge would make the site more attractive for the location of a new station and make financial sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Policing in Tralee is good with excellent interaction between the local policing committees and Oireachtas and county council members and a good relationship between the several effective community gardaí and local communities.  The current premises are not suitable for modern policing requirements as they are overcrowded, lack parking facilities, are inappropriately located and probably pose health and safety risks.  While the local police force is efficient and effective, its members feel these problems with the current station may affect the quality of policing they can give.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">There is a precedent regarding the free-of-charge transfer of Department of Defence lands to the OPW to facilitate a new Garda station in Ballincollig, County Cork, which is under construction, on the old Collins Barracks site.  Will the Minister of State clarify this when replying?</p>
            <p eId="para_751">In the southern Garda region, Tralee is recognised as the third busiest station after Anglesea Street, Cork and Henry Street, Limerick, respectively.  A new Garda station is critical for policing in Tralee and the surrounding areas.  A new divisional headquarters would provide proper accommodation for the technology the Garda must now use to combat increasingly more sophisticated criminals.  The local gardaí deserve the same accommodation enjoyed in most other parts of the country.  Tralee is rapidly expanding and is one of the largest provincial towns in the country.  For a town of its size, it is important that it has an appropriately sized station that can deal with the current challenges faced by its local Garda force.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_752">I am taking this Adjournment debate matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">With regard to Garda accommodation generally, the position is that the provision of Garda requirements is progressed by the Office of Public Works, on the basis of priorities established by An Garda Síochána.  In that context, capital expenditure on Garda accommodation, including all site purchases and new buildings, and the examination of potential sites for the location of Garda stations, comes under the remit of the Office of Public Works.  That office has overall responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has been informed that the Office of Public Works has been engaged for some time in a process of identifying a suitable site for the construction of a new Garda divisional headquarters in Tralee.  In addition, the Minister has been advised by the Office of Public Works that, despite repeated efforts, no suitable privately-owned sites have been identified in Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">As a consequence, the Office of Public Works has subsequently concentrated on the possibility of State-owned property being made available.  In particular, it has indicated that a Department of Defence-owned site has been identified as being potentially suitable to meet the accommodation needs of a number of State agencies, including An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">I understand that the Deputy is aware of the situation and that, in fact, he has put down a written parliamentary question on this specific matter, which was answered by the Minister for Defence earlier today.  The Deputy will appreciate from the reply provided to his question, that the Minister for Defence is of the view that military property should be disposed of on a fully commercial basis.  In that regard, the funding realised would be used to provide resources to meet the current and future equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">The Office of Public Works has reported that it has been engaged in ongoing negotiations to secure the Department of Defence property in Tralee.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has confirmed that this is a process he fully supports.  In addition, the Minister has indicated that he and his Department will work with the other relevant parties to bring the process to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_418">
            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_758">I am glad to be able to raise this matter which is very important for my constituency.  It concerns the provision of a new site for a modern Garda station in Clonmel.  At the outset, I wish to compliment all the Garda officers in Clonmel station under the command of Superintendent John Courtney. In this day and age, they need a proper facility to be able to carry out all the duties that are required of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">They need a modern building in order to deal 24 hours a day with all eventualities, including tackling crime, and responding to the needs of the community generally.  I compliment Superintendent Courtney for the leading role that his officers play in community policing, including their support for the community alert and neighbourhood watch programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">It is incumbent on the OPW to acquire a new site.  The current building, which is owned by the county council, is antiquated.  It is adjacent to the county council buildings which in turn require additional space.  The council has rented property all over Clonmel to try to cater for its own needs.  We need a modern site of which many are available in the town.  I have identified a number of good sites in town to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice and Law Reform, which could provide a one-stop-shop facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">The population of Clonmel is approximately 17,000.  It is the second biggest inland town in the country.  In addition, it covers a large area of the county as well as part of County Waterford across the River Suir.  It also covers rural districts including Kilcash, Kilsheelin and Mullinahone.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Two years ago, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, visited the constituency along with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh.  The Minister saw for himself that the current Garda station is totally unsuitable.  The public office area is tiny and totally unsatisfactory both for Garda personnel and the general public who must use it.  The lack of privacy is an issue, and although Garda officers do their best for the public it is not suitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">We recently received funding from the OPW to carry out minor upgrades on certain aspects of the station, but the building is really sub-standard and totally unsuitable.  Therefore a new accessible site is needed, which can be used as a one-stop-shop for everything from a Garda front-desk to a vehicle pound.  A new facility could also provide all technical aspects associated with the fight against crime.  We must fully support the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime in rural and urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">The public in Clonmel has a good relationship with the Garda, which we welcome and support.  The joint policing sub-committee had a meeting this evening and I wish its members well.  I also attend that committee when I can and there is a good relationship between both public and Garda representatives on that body.  I welcome the new Garda chief superintendent to Thurles.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">Some funds have been provided recently but they only covered a small aspect of what is required overall to bring about the new facility.  The current location was suitable at one time but is no longer so because the town has outgrown the station's capacity.  A greenfield site, of which there are a number, is required.  In addition, there are vacant factories and an old telecom site in Clonmel.  Such premises could be used to build a modern facility with sufficient parking, a suitable public office and other areas for consultation with legal representatives, as well as secure areas in which to store impounded vehicles.  A modern facility could be developed on a greenfield site, which is imperative for the future of policing in South Tipperary, including Clonmel.  The Garda Síochána needs proper facilities to allow its members to carry out their duties.  They have an onerous task which requires our support and they need modern facilities, including the tools of the trade, to deal with the sophisticated crimes perpetrated by gangsters in South Tipperary and other parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">The Garda is willing, ready and able to respond but needs the tools of the trade to do so.  Above all it needs proper, decent facilities for the superintendent and his team, including clerical staff.  In that way, they can carry out their duties to service the people of South Tipperary in accordance with health and safety regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I would like to thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The Deputy will be aware that the provision of new Garda stations and Garda accommodation generally is a matter for the Office of Public Works.

            <p eId="para_769">The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has been advised that the Office of Public Works has previously examined a number of potential sites in Clonmel with a view to providing a new Garda district headquarters.  Unfortunately, none of the sites assessed to date has been deemed suitable for Garda requirements.  The Minister has also been informed that the Office of Public Works is continuing to examine all available options for the provision of a Garda station in Clonmel with a view to progressing this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">The Minister also understands that in the interim, the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Mansergh, has recently announced that — as part of a national programme agreed with the Garda authorities covering around 170 stations — three cells each in Tipperary and Cahir Garda stations, and four in Clonmel, are to be refurbished by the OPW over the next 12 months or so.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The Minister is also aware that the Deputy has expressed a strong interest in having a new station built in Clonmel.  The Minister supports the project and it will be pursued in the context of the availability of a site which meets the needs of An Garda Síochána, its identified accommodation priorities and in the light of available resources.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         his plans to reform rent supplement so that payment is made directly to the landlord instead of the tenant. 
        [40034/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_420">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_773">The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long term housing support or a permanent solution to a person's housing needs.  Rent supplement has responded to the dramatic increased demand for income support to support accommodation costs.  There are currently 96,500 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 62% since the end of December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">Current legislation already provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  To remove the right of the tenant to receive this payment by making it payable only to the landlord would require legislative amendment and I have no plans at present to make this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords still have to collect the tenant contribution towards their rent (a minimum of €104 per month).  The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant's income; in some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while for others the tenant makes an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances. For example, where a person is in part-time income and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly whilst still having to collect the 90% from the tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if this arrangement were to be changed, for example, Community Welfare Officer's (CWO's) would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 96,500 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties. In particular, it would also result in CWOs being drawn into disputes between landlords and tenants.  There may also be financial and control implications in cases where a tenant moves address and neither the landlord nor tenant inform the Department.  Similarly, where a tenant is no longer eligible for rent supplement and the Department ceases paying the landlord, the Department may find itself involved in eviction proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process.  It is also open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent.  Where a CWO becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement for the purpose for which it was intended the matter is investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">Since 2004 local authorities have specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Local authorities are now meeting the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular the rental accommodation scheme (RAS).  In such cases the local authority has a direct contractual relationship with the landlord in RAS tenancies and as part of that contract the local authority pays rent directly to the landlord.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The current arrangements provide tenants with flexibility in terms of location, the freedom to move to a different location whilst allowing recipients time to seek alternative long-term housing solution provided by their local authority.  The tailoring of additional payments, such as rent supplement, to meet the specific needs of individuals and making the payment direct to the tenant is regarded as an effective way of helping individuals realise their potential and take individual responsibility.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_782">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 84 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently over 96,500 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 61 per cent since the end of 2007.  Over 44,500 have been in payment for 18 months or more.  A tabular statement is attached showing the number of persons claiming rent supplement for more than 18 months in each of the past three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The rental accommodation scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities.  Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including: the traditional social housing, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.  Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 28,939 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005: 15,986 rent supplement recipients to RAS accommodation and a further 12,953 to social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly.  In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred to RAS and social housing in 2008 and 2009; achieving targets set for RAS transfers for these years.  The target established for 2010 is for a further 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.  In consultation with the Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers.  These include allowing applicants for RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme. Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can source applicants for social housing support from long-term rent supplement tenancies also.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups.  The purpose of these Groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_803">The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  These include the employment support schemes, the activation programme and the Department's role in the National Employment Action Plan.  The Department also supports new activation measures undertaken by other agencies, for example, the Work Placement Programme administered by FÁS and the Labour Market Activation Fund 2010 administered by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) is operated by my Department and is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments to make a return to work financially attractive and viable.  The main purpose of the BTWEA is to encourage the long term unemployed to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment.  The Short Term Enterprise Allowance is payable to a person who qualifies for Jobseekers' Benefit and who wishes to commence in self employment.  This allowance is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker's Benefit entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme was launched on 20th June 2010.  Under the scheme, if any employer takes on additional member of staff in 2010 who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, s/he will be exempted from paying employers' PRSI for 12 months.  The job must be new and additional, be for at least 30 hours a week and last for at least 6 months.  The purpose of the scheme is to support job creation and counter the drift of people into long-term unemployment and welfare dependency.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">There is also a network of Facilitators (currently 66 serving) at a local level in my Department.  Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  They work in close co-operation with other agencies and service providers including FÁS, VEC, other education and training providers and the local and community and voluntary sector.  In addition they provide advice and support to customers who wish to access the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme, and the short term enterprise allowance scheme of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Innovation, this Department already has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.  The National Employment Action Plan is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.  It has been in operation since 1998 and has proven successful in that period in assisting people on the live register back into employment.  Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register, are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to FÁS for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">In the period January to end of August, 2010 (the latest period for which data is available to this Department) a total of 60,797 persons were referred to FÁS — this is an increase of 9% (4,914) over the same period in 2009. 46,146 (76%) were interviewed by FÁS and 9,489 (16%) were placed in jobs, training or education.  The Employment Action plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Currently under the National Employment Action Plan customers are referred on an individual basis by this Department to FÁS.  Under a new initiative, aimed at increasing the capacity and the efficiency of the process, jobseekers are being referred to group engagement sessions.  These group engagements are hosted jointly by FÁS and my Department.  At the engagement presentations are given by FÁS and my Department's Facilitators providing relevant information and advice and arranging follow-on individual appointments where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Recent statistics (CSO QNHS Q2 2010) show that long term unemployment has increased from 1.5% in Q2 2008 to 5.9% in Q2 2010.  Preventing long-term unemployment is important from both economic and social perspectives, especially because long-term unemployment tends to lead to erosion of skills and self-confidence, and damages future employment prospects.  Effective prevention depends on being able to identify those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed at an early stage, and referring them to appropriate labour market programmes to improve their chances of obtaining employment.  This was the motivation for a recently published ESRI report (<i>National Profiling of the Unemployed in Ireland</i> ESRI Research Series No. 10) which developed a statistical profiling model for Ireland that would identify those individuals with a high risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  This model is now being developed for use in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Under changes in ministerial responsibility announced earlier this year, the rural social scheme and community services programmes have transferred to this Department from the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Work is also underway to finalise the transfer of both the Employment and Community Services divisions of FÁS to my Department.  Overall, the transfer of functions being implemented will facilitate the delivery of a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed.  Bringing together, under the aegis of one department, the employment services of FÁS, the expertise of its Placement Officers and the unemployment services of this Department as well as the Community Employment Schemes, Job Initiative Scheme, Community Services Programme and the Rural Social Scheme will offer significant opportunities to generate synergies, improve efficiency and, ultimately, improve service delivery to those availing of those services.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">I propose to take Question Nos. 55, 71 and 90 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The Department of Social Protection already assists low income households with heating costs through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance scheme and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks each year from end September to early May.  In the 2010/2011 heating season it is estimated that over 350,000 recipients will benefit from the allowance at a cost of over €239 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">There are also 380,000 pensioner and other households in receipt of the household benefits package which provides up to 2,400 electricity units per annum (or the gas equivalent) over the year.  It is estimated that 140,000 of these households are receiving both the fuel allowance and the electricity/gas allowance under the household benefits package to assist with heating and other energy requirements.  The electricity and gas allowances under the household benefit package cost €184 million in 2009.  I have recently announced that the electricity allowance has been increased with effect from 1 October 2010 to cover the cost of the Public Service Obligation levy on domestic electricity, which will increase the annual cost of the scheme by €12.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of supports, investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives such as the Keep Well and Warm booklet and accompanying associated website.  Some 150,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed to date in the last couple of years.  The Warmer Homes Scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is the primary mechanism for alleviating the key underlying cause of energy poverty — that of thermal inefficiency of houses.  Over 19,000 low-income houses were retrofitted in 2009 with a target of a further 22,500 in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of €130 million in funding for insulation, €76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter- Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area.  They were tasked with devising an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 61, 67 and 83 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Between 1997 and 2009, overall expenditure on Child Income Supports (Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement, Qualified Child Increases, Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance) grew from just below €900 million to approximately €3.5 billion per year.  Clearly social welfare spending and specifically Child Benefit, is a very significant part of overall Government spending. The Government is proud to have been able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all families in recent years.  However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to ensure that they are sustainable and to ensure that resources are allocated fairly.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">With regard to Child Benefit, the Government is conscious that this universal payment can be an important source of income for all families and so in Budget 2010 decided against withdrawing Child Benefit completely from any family.  In the context of Budget 2010, the Minister for Finance noted the legal and logistical reasons why means testing or taxing Child Benefit could not be done at that stage.  For these reasons in 2010, the Government decided to reduce the Child Benefit payment rates while protecting those children in families who were dependent on social welfare or in low income employment by increasing Qualified Child Increases and FIS income limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Social welfare expenditure for 2011, including expenditure on Child Income Support payments, is currently being considered in the context of the preparation of the departmental estimates for that year.  Any plans to change the Child Benefit and Family Income Supplement payments are a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The Department is currently carrying out a value-for-money review in the area of Child Income Support payments.  The review is nearing completion and in line with the overall approach of the expenditure review process, conclusions reached in the review, while not necessarily representing Government policy in this area, can be expected to play a role in informing future policy development particularly directed at securing more coherent, effective and efficient spending of public money on families with children.  The question of higher levels of taxation for those with higher wealth or incomes is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">Activation and support for those who are unemployed is a key priority for Government.  Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced a number of changes to improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas.  These changes included the restructuring of Departmental responsibilities with the objective of providing a stream-lined response to the income support and job search needs of people who are unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">In this context, my Department is devising proposals for the development of new initiatives based on the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programme which will offer social employment opportunities.  This new initiative will be an important element in the development and delivery of employment and community services and will aim to provide quality work opportunities to the unemployed and beneficial outcomes to the community.  A key feature of the new scheme will be to provide a new activation route that will support unemployed people in remaining job-ready for re-entry to employment as the economic environment improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">Considerable work is required on these proposals before they come on stream and take their place within the suite of activation measures aimed at supporting unemployed people.  I have not set targets as to how many employment opportunities might be created as much depends on the level of resources that will be available to the Department and the capacity of not-for-profit community based organisations to avail of these emerging opportunities.  Details of the roll out of this initiative will be made available as soon as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_426">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_835">Marriages of convenience, or "sham marriages" are marriages which are entered into for the purpose of one of the parties gaining an automatic right of residency based on marriage to a person who already has a right of residency.  These marriages exploit Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which deals with the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.  This directive came into force on April 20th 2006.  The matter was further compounded by the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case on 25th July 2008, which held that these rights applied to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">As has been widely reported in the media, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has lodged objections to a large number of marriages involving non-EU/EEA nationals, under Section 58 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004.  Under the Act, if the objection relates to the possible existence of an impediment to the intended marriage, it is referred to the Registrar General to be investigated.  The objection can only be upheld if it is based on the provision of the Civil Registration Act and these do not include questioning the reason for marriage.  Since the enactment of the marriage provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 on the 5th November 2007 a total of 73 objections have been lodged by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, for investigation under Section 58(4) of the Act.  To date, one of the objections has been withdrawn, and the couple in question has been advised that the marriage could proceed.  The remaining objections are still under investigation by the Registrar General.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">While objections to marriages are upheld if there is an impediment, it is important to point out that issues which go to the identity of a party to a marriage or to consent to marry can also, potentially, render a marriage invalid.  In such cases, it would be unsafe to allow the marriage to proceed.  Newly updated Guidelines for Registrars for Marriage Notifications containing requirements concerning notification procedures, including the verification of identity and marital status, have been recently issued by the Registrar General to all registrars.  I am also aware that this matter has been considered by the Department of Justice and Law Reform in the context of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">I can assure the Deputy that the matter is being researched urgently with a view to identifying what further measures may be taken, including the possibility of legislating for any such measures.  I am aware that procedures to prevent marriages of convenience are in place in other EU member States, and I would hope that equivalent measures might be introduced here.  The GRO has sought legal advice as to its options and will proceed on the basis of this advice as quickly as possible once it is received.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_843">I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 76, 95 and 96 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other Government Departments, the specifications for a Public Services Card (PSC) under the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE, programme.  The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">Legislative provisions in relation to the introduction of the Public Services Card have been included in Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended by Section 32 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007).  These specify that the Minister may issue a Public Services Card in the format that he or she deems fit with the person's name, personal public service number, photograph, signature, card issue number and card expiry date to be inscribed on the card.  Provision is also included for the person's name, personal public service number, date of birth, sex, all former surnames (if any) of the person's mother, photograph, signature and card expiry date to be electronically encoded on the card.  In addition, provision is made for any other information that may be prescribed to be either inscribed or electronically encoded on the card.  It is my intention to provide for the addition of place of birth and nationality to the data set to be encoded on the chip in the Act before the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">Over the past few years significant progress had been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services. Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.  However, in view of the uncertain economic climate, the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of last year. A contract was agreed with the managed service provider from early January.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The remaining elements of the project commenced at that time and are expected to take several more months to complete.  Significant preparatory work has been undertaken including decisions regarding the final design of the card and the commencement of the development of a secure site for the personalisation of the cards.  It is also necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the management and administration of the cards. Some of this development is being undertaken internally while procurement for the remainder is underway.  Exact costs for this aspect are not yet known.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">At the moment it is estimated that, following implementation of the necessary registration infrastructure, the production capability will be ready in December and card issue for customers of the Department will commence early in 2011. The overall timeframe for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to securely register all of those to whom it will be issued. Initial registration will be carried out in the Department and it is also exploring what other options exist for external registration. Initial registration will be for those customers seeking PPS Numbers and this will be followed by registration for selected groups of claimants, including phased issue to Free Travel customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">The Public Services Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card, with highly secure cards.  Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card and the infrastructure that will support it.  Features such as photographs and signatures and electronic card authentication are expected to minimise the rate of fraud and error arising from incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The managed service provider's costs are for some €24m for a population of 3m with issuance taking about three to five years (i.e. about €8 per card including postage at the volumes stated).  The Department's current estimates provide for the cost of technical systems development and initial issue of a quantity of cards. It is intended to mitigate the costs of the PSC through reliance on existing resources and utilisation of relevant data already held by the State, for instance photographs and signatures held by the Department in relation to the All-Ireland Free Travel Scheme, possible use of Passport Office data.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">A further benefit of the Public Services Card will be the efficiencies that can be achieved by all agencies and customers using the card.  The time spent on establishing identity and authentication will be reduced on both sides, leading to significant potential savings nationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_854">I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 69 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">The determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended. Subsection (4) specifically directs the deciding officer to "take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_856">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p>
            <p eId="para_857">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_858">(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;</p>
            <p eId="para_859">(d) the person's main centre of interest, and</p>
            <p eId="para_860">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances."</p>
            <p eId="para_861">These five specified factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law which examined the concept of habitual residence in the context of social welfare benefits.  The Department's guidelines go on to point out that "No single factor is conclusive.  The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case. It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition".</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The current guidelines regarding determination of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically under the heading: Resuming previous residence.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_863">"A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State or within the Common Travel Area and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her permanent residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State. In determining habitual residence in such cases the deciding officer should take account of</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_864">purpose of return e.g. expiry of foreign residence permit</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_865">the applicant's stated intentions</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_866">verified arrangements which have been made in regard to returning on a long-term basis e.g. transfer of financial accounts and any other assets</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_867">length and continuity of the previous residence in the State</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_868">the record of employment or self employment in another State and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_869">whether s/he has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his/her previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence."</p>
            <p eId="para_870">These guidelines are currently being revised with a view to making them more user-friendly for deciding officers and customers alike.  All issues that have been raised recently by Deputies and interested groups are being fully considered in this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_872">The One-Parent Family Payment, by its nature, is not payable where the lone parent is cohabiting with the other parent of the child or with someone else as husband and wife.  The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents", which was published in 2006, proposed that the category of lone parenthood would be abolished.  Instead, a parental allowance would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on a low income, thus ending the cohabitation rule.  It will not be possible for my Department to progress this aspect of the proposal due, in part, to the current economic climate.  These proposals have, however, informed deliberations regarding the One-Parent Family Payment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">The current duration of the One-Parent Family Payment, which is payable until the  youngest child in a lone parent family reaches the age of 18 years — or 22 years if in full-time education — is not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society.  Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to:</p>
            <p eId="para_874">prevent long-term dependence on social welfare supports and facilitate financial independence;</p>
            <p eId="para_875">recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, and</p>
            <p eId="para_876">include an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">To meet these social policy objectives, my Department has introduced changes to the One-Parent Family Payment in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.  For new customers, from April 2011, the One-Parent Family Payment will be paid until the youngest child in the family reaches the age of 14 years.  For existing recipients of the payment, there will be a six-year phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.  Special provisions will be made for families with children for whom the Domiciliary Care Allowance is paid and for the recently bereaved (both married and cohabiting).  These changes will bring Ireland's support for lone parents more in line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.  It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance.  This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.  90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">The Citizens Information Board (CIB), who has responsibility for MABS, compiles information on the waiting times in each MABS office on a quarterly basis and posts it to the www.mabs.ie   website.  Based on the latest information available, at the end of September 2010 the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is some 4.9 weeks.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.  During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.  I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_884">I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 74 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">There are approximately 18,000 persons currently in receipt of mortgage interest supplement (MIS).  This represents a 120% increase since the end of 2008 when there were 8,100 recipients.  The Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group, chaired by Mr Hugh Cooney.  The main purpose of the Department's review was to examine how the scheme could continue to meet its primary objective of catering for those who require short-term assistance.  The review group included representatives from my Department, the Community Welfare Service, the Departments of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator.  The Department's review is available on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">The Department's review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme set out a number of recommendations.  These recommendations are centered on the delivery of significant customer service improvement by ensuring that State support for those unable to deal with mortgage arrears is better targeted, consistent and easily understood.  Allied with the focus on customer service improvement are recommendations that seek to ensure that lending institutions, borrowers and the Exchequer share responsibilities and commitments in a balanced way.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The key proposals of the Department's mortgage interest supplement review are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_888">1. Mortgage interest supplement will become a time bound payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">2. To remove the ‘30 hour rule' — this will allow couples / single people who, due to the economic downturn, have suffered a significant loss of income and now find themselves in a distressed mortgage and require MIS support.  Under current rules, due to these people working a full working week they would not be entitled to MIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">3. The rule excluding mortgage interest supplement where a property is offered for sale is unduly restrictive in the current market and should be suspended and re-introduced when the housing market recovers.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">4. Mortgage interest supplement should not be provided where repayments of the capital element of the loan are being made to the lender. This will insure the borrower is not placed under additional financial stress.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">5. The applicant should be afforded a six month period of forbearance with the lender before the State intervenes in providing mortgage interest supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">6. Mortgage interest supplement should not be payable in respect of any housing loans of other State agencies or housing authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">7. Successful applicants must be assisted to ensure that their long term housing support needs, if any, are met prior to the cessation of mortgage interest supplement payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">My Department is currently developing an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. This plan will be completed when the recommendations of final report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group are available.  This report is expected to be completed shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">The number of interviews or consultations that a jobseeker will attend over the course of his or her claim will vary from person to person. Customers claiming jobseeker's allowance may have to be interviewed by an inspector at the beginning of their claim and at any subsequent review of their means.  Once a customer is three months on the Live Register, he or she will be selected for interview by FÁS under the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) and may also be interviewed or elect to consult with the job facilitator at any stage during their claim. The Department refers a number of people that have been through the NEAP process to facilitators on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">For entitlement to jobseeker schemes the customer must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  As part of the normal control process, a future review date is entered on the payment system for all jobseeker customers. Additional review dates are entered, as necessary, throughout the life of the claim. At each date the claim is reviewed and, where necessary, the customer is interviewed to ensure that he or she continues to satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  The current system of interviews and consultations provides the Department with opportunities to assess a customer's commitment to seek work and his/her availability for work.  In addition, it provides customers with opportunities to discuss the employment and education opportunities available to them at various points in their claim.  The current arrangements are kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_908">The Taoiseach announced on 23rd March 2010 that the Department of Social and Family Affairs would be reconfigured as the Department of Social Protection with the transfer to it of a number of functions including the employment and community services programmes of FÁS and the transfer from it of functions relating to social inclusion and family supports.  The training services of FÁS will remain under the remit of my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  The purpose of this reorganisation is to provide a more effective and streamlined service to the unemployed by integrating the income support provided through the social welfare system with supports for activation and re-entry to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The Social Welfare Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2010 provided the legislative basis for transferring policy and financial responsibility for the employment and community services programmes of FÁS from the Minister for Education and Skills.  It is intended to commence this part of the Act shortly.  From date of commencement, FÁS will continue to provide these services but under the direction of my Department.   Further legislation is under preparation to provide for the transfer the relevant staff and related resources from FÁS to my Department during the course of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">A major programme of change is currently being developed by my Department, in close consultation with senior management in FÁS and the Department of Education and Skills, with the objective of developing a new service vision and model for the integrated Department.  The aim is to create a Department which is structured around the customer rather than the schemes it delivers so that people can obtain the services they require, and are entitled to, in a seamless, effective and efficient way.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">In this regard, a number of significant steps have already been taken to develop a more streamlined and integrated service between FÁS and my Department.  For example, as a result of a review of the National Employment Action Plan, a number of enhancements are being made to improve the delivery of services to people who are unemployed.  These include the introduction of group engagements with people referred to the employment services and the development of a new case management approach to managing interactions with people signing on for jobseekers payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">Where the funding of Community Employment projects is concerned, the current resources allocated to this programme will be transferring to my Department.  Any decisions as to the future funding of these projects will be taken in the context of the Government's deliberations on the four year budgetary framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_914">My Department operates a range of means tested schemes and these schemes, including the means testing elements, are administered through a network of local offices, central offices and, in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, through the offices of community welfare officers.  My Department is not currently considering the centralising of means testing of social welfare payments.  However, two important projects are underway which will enhance the delivery of means tested payments.  Firstly, a project to facilitate the capture and storage of means information and the calculation of customer means across social assistance schemes is being undertaken at present.  These schemes include Jobseeker's Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance (currently administered by the Health Service Executive).</p>
            <p eId="para_915">One of the benefits of this project is that the Department will be, where appropriate, able to re-use means information already held which in turn will provide better customer service by reducing the need for different parts of the Department to request information from the applicant.  Other benefits of this project include:</p>
            <p eId="para_916">achieving qualitative and quantitative improvements in productivity</p>
            <p eId="para_917">achieving value for money in the use of resources;</p>
            <p eId="para_918">implementing secure control processes;</p>
            <p eId="para_919">providing better management information;</p>
            <p eId="para_920">allowing for the future introduction of mobile working to facilitate the electronic capture of data at time of investigation; and</p>
            <p eId="para_921">placing the Department  in a position to anticipate and respond to changing business demands e.g. additional means factors, changes to scheme rules etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">This project is expected to be completed in by April 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Secondly, the integration of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) into the Department will result in a more coordinated approach to the provision of service to the public. This will create opportunities to remove duplication of work, including in the area of means assessment.  The target date for the transfer is 1st January 2011 and discussions in that regard are continuing with the unions representing the CWS employees concerned and with the unions representing the Department's existing staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_925">The Department processes in excess of two million claims each year and it makes payments to over one million people every week.  It is important to emphasise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them. The Department has a broad-ranging and comprehensive control strategy, which aims to keep fraud and abuse to a minimum.  The emphasis is to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle.  Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis.  At the end September 2010 over 546,000 individual claims were reviewed across all schemes.  The Department has introduced measures, which are evidence based, to target control activity at higher risk schemes and categories of claimants.  These include addressing residency risks in appropriate schemes.  An estimate of the extent of fraud described by the Deputy is not available.  However at the end of 2009 approx 10% of cases which were specifically targeted for residency reviews resulted in savings in Jobseekers payments while in the Child benefit scheme approximately 3% of overall residency reviews resulted in savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">Specific controls to target residency as a risk factor include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_928">1. Nationwide residency checks were introduced for non-Irish nationals on a jobseekers payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">2. New claimants for jobseekers payments do not receive payment into their bank account.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">3. Stricter identity checks have been introduced in Post Offices throughout the country for people collecting Social Welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">4. A comprehensive set of rigorous checks are being applied by Local Offices and Inspectors on claims from people who move from Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">5. Officials also liaise regularly with colleagues in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain to establish if claimants are in receipt of welfare payments outside of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">6. The Department participates in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints with other agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">7. The facility to report suspect activity on the Department of Social Protection website was introduced early this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">8. The Department's Special Investigation Unit is managed centrally since<b> </b>  February, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Other measures which address control risk factors include the appointment of additional Inspectors.  In addition fraud detection systems have been improved through data matching with other organisations.  The consequences for social welfare fraud can be severe. Criminal prosecutions may be taken against persons who defraud the social welfare system and employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations.  The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_939">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 81 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum Funding Standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge their accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years, although as part of measures announced by the Government, the Pensions Board can now allow a scheme ten years or more to meet the standard in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">At the end of 2009, there were 254,325 members in 1,192 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  It was estimated at that time that in excess of 75% of these schemes were in deficit.  In a recent survey undertaken by the Pensions Board 70% of schemes reported to be in deficit.  However, the extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The Government is very conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds during 2007 and 2008.  While schemes recovered some of their losses since then, we are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">Indeed, this was the thinking behind the implementation of a number of measures introduced to ease the pressures being felt by many pension funds.  Those measures included the granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals and allowing longer periods for recovery plans.  In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 amended the Pensions Act to allow for the restructuring of underfunded schemes; to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme and to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board in ensuring that pension contributions deducted from wages and salaries are remitted by employers to scheme trustees. This Act also introduced the legislative provisions to enable the Minister for Finance to establish the Pensions Insolvency Payments Scheme (PIPS) to reduce the cost of purchasing pension payments for trustees of pension schemes where the employer has become insolvent.  The PIPS came into effect in February 2010 and will ensure a more equitable distribution of assets following the wind up of underfunded pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">In March of this year the Government launched the National Pensions Framework. As the Deputy is aware, the framework sets out the Government's intention for a radical and wide-scale reform of the Irish pension system.  I announced last month that work on the new defined benefit pension model, as outlined in this Framework, would be expedited. My Department will aim to introduce this new model, following legislative changes on 1 July 2011.  Following this announcement, the deadline of the 30th November for the submission of funding proposal to the Pension Board was deferred. It is anticipated that the deferral of this deadline will allow scheme time to take account of reforms to the defined benefit model in the preparation of funding proposals for submission to the Pensions Board by a date which will be announced by the Pensions Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">As you are aware, the Government has established an implementation group charged with bringing forward proposals for the introduction of measures contained in the National Pensions Framework. As part of its deliberations, the proposal for a sovereign annuity mentioned by Deputy Shortall is also being given serious consideration.  It must be stressed that the issue is by no means straight-forward and the benefits and risks involved for all stakeholders are being fully assessed.</p>

            <p eId="para_947">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Rent supplement is not payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, that is for 30 hours or more a week. However, provision was made in 2007 whereby a person on rent supplement, who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme, may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, without losing entitlement to their rent supplement payment.</p>

The use of 30 hours as the part-time limit for SWA is designed to be as advantageous as possible to individuals returning to the employment market without including those in full-time employment, thus reflecting the scheme's original purpose of a short-term income support payment.  Support for those in full-time employment and who require long term housing support are provided by local authority housing initiatives which include the rental accommodation scheme and other social housing placement schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_950">The Government is currently examining ways of providing further support to graduate retention in the economy, with policy matters in this area being primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills. The main existing employment support mechanism for graduates is the work placement programme administered by FÁS. A key element of the programme is that the customer retains their social welfare entitlement. This facility has also been extended to the IBEC gradlink programme. While on either programme a person must be genuinely seeking work and must take up an offer of paid employment if one arises.  In this way participants may continue to satisfy the social welfare criteria of being available for and genuinely seeking work.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">However, if a participant is paid a top-up by their employer this constitutes reckonable earnings from employment. On this basis they can no longer be considered unemployed. Additionally, in relation to those in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment, such income would fall to be assessed as means.  The distinction between employed and unemployed is of crucial importance in the design and administration of any such scheme. Design of a scheme that permits retention of social welfare benefits while a person is in receipt of wages or non-pecuniary emoluments must take cognisance of substitution and replacement effects, while remaining attractive to both interns and hosts. On this basis careful control and demarcation is essential in schemes of this nature.  Payments by employers also raise fundamental issues in relation to employment rights, taxation and social insurance. These matters are informing ongoing policy discussions in relation to internships.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">Significant improvements to the means test for rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement were implemented in 2007. The assessment of means for these schemes now provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive a rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 91 and 357 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are reviewed in all areas of the Department.  These reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">The main impact on service delivery has arisen due to the increase in the Live Register which increased from 240,217 at September 2008 to 419,854 at September 2009 and 442,417 at September 2010.  In response, all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims has been examined and streamlined wherever possible.  In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending their Local Office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">In addition, a range of other process improvements have been introduced which include:</p>
            <p eId="para_963">A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires;</p>
            <p eId="para_964">A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years;</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times;</p>
            <p eId="para_966">More straightforward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced;</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The Department has also simplified processing methods for some customers who work casually, part-time or on systematic short-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">Since May 2008, 766 staff have been assigned to my Department, mainly through the transfer and redeployment of staff from other Government Departments.  The staff assigned have filled additional posts and critical vacancies in Local Offices, Support Units, Scheme areas and the Department's Inspectorate.  Some of these posts were sourced through a staff levy imposed on other Government Departments in April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">A number of initiatives have also been put in place to enhance the capacity of the Social Welfare Appeals Office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</p>
            <p eId="para_970">2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</p>
            <p eId="para_971">A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</p>
            <p eId="para_972">The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</p>
            <p eId="para_973">A  project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented,  and</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Eight experienced retired Appeals Officers have been re-employed on a part-time basis since July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">In conclusion, I wish to assure Deputies that service delivery remains a key priority in my Department and that processes are kept under continuous review to ensure that services are delivered promptly to customers.  Staffing needs are also kept under constant review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_978">Social welfare legislation does not currently provide for reimbursement to the Department by insurance companies in cases where adjustments may have been made to special damages awards on foot of social welfare payments received by plaintiffs.  Preliminary work has been undertaken by my Department in relation to the issues involved. These issues are complex, not least insofar as there could be consequences for economic competitiveness and negative downstream costs for employers and employees in terms of increased insurance premia in respect of employer liability, public liability and transport cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Against that background, the introduction of any changes in this area would necessitate extensive consultations with a wide range of interested parties, including not only representatives of the insurance industry but also the legal profession and employers' representatives amongst others, in order to adequately assess all of the possible implications and to comply with formal Regulatory Impact Assessment requirements.  In view of the wider potential implications, I intend to consult with my Government colleagues with a view to securing agreement on the most appropriate course of action in relation to this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  The purpose of the household income limit is to ensure that the allowance is directed at those with the greatest need.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">In Budget 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance were increased by €50.  The rates of back to school clothing and footwear allowance have been increased significantly in recent years.  Since 2005, the allowance has increased from €80 to €200 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and from €150 to €305 for those aged 12 to 22. These are increases of 150% and 103% respectively.   As a special measure introduced in Budget 2009, an additional allowance of €215 is payable to 18 year olds only in respect of whom compensatory child benefit is in payment.  Total payment in respect of children aged 18 is €520.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The number of children benefiting from the allowance increased from 161,000 in 2006 to over 277,000 in 2009. The number of families benefiting has increased from 79,000 in 2006 to almost 140,000 in 2009. Approximately 170,000 families were expected to benefit from the Scheme in 2010 year. At 15 October 2010 in excess 160,444 claims had been paid at a value in excess of €76.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">My Department established a Working Group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme as part of its Expenditure Review Programme.  The Working Group published its report in August 2004.  In relation to the adequacy of the payment rates of the scheme, the review noted that while the value of the BSCFA had increased by 152% for children under 12 and by 194% for children over 12 since 1990, the Consumer Price Index figure for clothing and footwear dropped by over 24% in the same period.   The review concluded that payment rates did not warrant adjustment. Nevertheless, the rates of payment for BSCFA were increased in recent years, including increases in the income limit which have enabled more people to qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The most recent Consumer Price Index figures show that clothing and footwear costs have:</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Fallen by 7.4% in the last 12 months;</p>
            <p eId="para_987">Fallen by 27.6% since December 2006;</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Fallen by 38.1% since December 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">The adequacy of back to school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be kept under review.  Any further changes to the scheme would have to be considered in the context of future Budgets and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_995">The primary objective of the Department's information policy is to ensure that all customers are made aware of the wide range of schemes and services available and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.  The Department operates a network of some 125<b/>local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each local office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  Information officers provide a range of information to customers on their entitlements including, in broad terms, the effect that taking up work may have on their social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">In addition, the Department's network of facilitators work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities for people.  This locally-based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets and these are available in a wide range of outlets, including Social Welfare Local Offices, Citizens Information Centres and Post Offices.  Leaflets can also be requested through the Department's website www.welfare.ie.  The website contains full information on the range of schemes and services, including supports that may be available to jobseekers on return to the workforce such as Family Income Supplement, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, etc.   There is a ‘Frequently Asked Questions' section dedicated to Jobseekers which is available in English, Irish and Polish and provides answers to some of the most common queries the Department receives on topics such as taxation of benefits and on options available regarding training, employment, self-employment and voluntary work.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, which was launched on June 21st this year, is prominently advertised on our website's home page.  The Department also operates a PRSI Mailing List via its website, and the almost four thousand subscribers, primarily employers and tax practitioners, receive mails on PRSI changes each year.  Funding is also provided annually to the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed (INOU) to produce their booklet "Working for Work", which contains full information on jobseekers payments, the training and development options available to jobseekers as well as advice on job searching, tax and other social services provided by other Departments and agencies.  INOU provide free copies of the "Working for Work" booklet to people in receipt of social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, is the national information agency with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice on the broad range of social services including social welfare services.  Information is provided through Citizen Information Centres and other offices throughout the country, through the Citizens Information Phone Service (1890 777 121) which operates from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday and on their website at www.citizensinformation.ie.  The Citizens Information Board recently launched a new website dedicated to people recently made unemployed, called www.losingyourjob.ie.  This site provides a single point of information for anyone looking for assistance with unemployment or reduced hours.  The Department will continue to increase and improve the channels through which it delivers information services to all its customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1001">Between 1994 and 2008 social welfare pensions increased by 148% while the Consumer Price Index for this period increased by 51%.

A pensioner couple would be eligible for a weekly income of €436.60.  These pension increases demonstrate the significant improvements which were made in real terms in pension rates. In Budget 2010, the Government avoided any cuts in the State pension. Weekly rates of payments to pensioners (those 66 and over) were not reduced and neither were other supports such as the household benefits package which includes the free TV licence, electricity/gas allowance and telephone allowance.  The living alone and over 80 allowances were also retained at existing levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">I have been engaged in an intensive round of consultations with a wide range of welfare representative organisations and I am listening carefully to their views. In an uncertain international environment, my priority will be to ensure that the overall Government strategy is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.  It is important to stress that, at this stage, no decisions have been taken either by me or by the Government with regard to the forthcoming Budget.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1006">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 99 and 103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">In considering any changes to social welfare schemes, full consideration is given to the impact of any proposals on the recipients involved.  The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.  Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively.  As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">Where a person is not satisfied with a decision in relation to their entitlement to Supplementary Welfare Allowance, they have a right of appeal in accordance with the terms of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  This provides for the appeal to be considered by an Appeals Officer within the HSE.  However, where this appeal is unsuccessful, the appellant can make a further appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  It is assumed that this is the two-step appeals process to which the Deputy refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">The appeals process in the case of the schemes administered by the Department differs in so far as there is only one right of appeal and that is to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Part of this process involves a review of the case by a deciding officer before it is forwarded to the SWAO.  When the Community Welfare Service is transferred to my Department, the HSE Appeals Office will no longer have a role in relation to the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  Instead it is proposed that appealable decisions will be dealt with by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in the same way as for other schemes administered by my Department.  The legislation governing Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeals when the Community Welfare Allowance transfer to my Department was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. The provision is subject to a Commencement Order.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">With effect from 19th July 2010, changes have been introduced to BTEA to increase flexibility in terms of accessing the scheme.     The period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing BTEA was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  In addition, a person in certain circumstances can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">The back to education scheme covers courses of education from second level to higher diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person's employability.  BTEA will not usually be approved if a person holds a qualification equivalent or higher than the qualification for which the application has been received.  Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">However, a small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master's course on the basis of relevant life experience. In the context of the ongoing monitoring of the operation of the scheme, it has been decided to extend entitlement to the Back to Education Allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">The focus of the Back to Education Allowance is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects.  Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is a free, independent and confidential service which assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  MABS promotes the importance of people coping with debt difficulties taking early action with their creditors and approaching MABS for help and guidance.  This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties. Often people will have multiple creditors and MABS money advisers will assist clients in working out budgets and negotiating on behalf of all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">In addition to face-to-face meetings with a money adviser, MABS operates a National Telephone Helpline, available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday.  As 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation, it would not be appropriate to place a financial charge on financial institutions and or utility companies in these instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">In addition, MABS companies around the country are involved in many local education and information initiatives.  This close involvement of MABS staff in education activity ensures that community education remains at the heart of the money advice process; promoting effective household budget management and empowering individuals to help themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">I do not propose to introduce measures whereby financial institutions and or utility companies subsidise the work of MABS as this would compromise the independence of MABS services, would not be appropriate where people use assisted self-help services, and would be extremely difficult to do given that most people have multiple creditors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1026">Self-employed people pay PRSI class S contributions which provide cover for long-term benefits such as state pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory).  Employees are covered by PRSI classes A, E, H and P, which provide cover for the above benefits as well as for short-term contingencies such as jobseekers and illness benefits.   PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments.  Self-employed people pay class S contributions at a rate of 3% per annum, as compared to the 14.75% full Class A contributions paid by employees and their employers, to reflect the narrower range of benefits they receive.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance. They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and the process recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</p>

Successful applicants are exempted from liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees for 12 months from the date they are approved for the scheme.

            <p eId="para_1033">The OECD Report on Better Regulation in Ireland was published today on the OECD website.  It had been presented to Government in October to note its upcoming publication.  The publication of the Report is being formally marked by a special conference organised by my Department in which the OECD will participate on 29th of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The Report recognises the considerable progress made on the Better Regulation agenda since the original OECD review in 2001 which compares well with other EU countries.  In particular, it commends the Better Regulation Unit (BRU) in my Department for its role as a highly active advocate of Better Regulation across Government and beyond.  It acknowledges the BRU's role in raising awareness of the Better Regulation agenda and in the provision of supports for conducting Regulatory Impact Analysis. However, the report also identifies a need for greater engagement with the agenda across the Government system including a need for strong linkages between this agenda and economic renewal and public service transformation strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">There are a number of key areas which the report focuses on. With regard to the issue of Regulatory Impact Analysis   (RIA), the OECD note that the Irish model and supports such as training, guidelines and helpdesk assistance compare well with those developed in other EU Member States. However, they also point out that the quality of RIAs require improvement together with more frequent publication.  These issues are to be addressed by individual Ministers and their Departments.  The report notes that while some work is underway to reduce administrative burdens on business considerable further effort will be required from all relevant Departments if the target of a 25% reduction by 2012 is to be made. The team acknowledged also that a good start had been made on addressing the issue of risk-based enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">In addressing the issue of the accessibility of the law, the OECD note the complexity of the Irish legal system which makes a focus on accessibility all the more important. They stress the importance of maintaining a momentum on projects in this area in the face of tight resources. This includes, in particular, Statute Law Revision, Restatement, consolidation and the maintenance of the Statute Book.  It is suggested that Local Authorities  would be invited to take part in the administrative burden reduction programme. Enhanced consultation mechanisms between the national and local level are also suggested.</p>

            <p eId="para_1050">The Ireland Newfoundland Partnership (INP) was established in 2001 on foot of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Government of Ireland and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.  The original agreement, signed by former Taoiseach John Bruton in 1996, together with then Premier of Newfoundland, Brian Tobin, was re-affirmed by my predecessor, Mr. Ahern in 1999 and 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">The role of the INP is to manage the agreement between the two Governments, recognising the deep historical links between the two Islands, and to identify new areas for collaboration.  It assists Irish organisations to identify and carry out joint projects with Newfoundland partners through government, research, business, educational and cultural activities.  The Partnership also aims to raise the awareness of Newfoundland and its Irish heritage.  The administrative office of the INP, originally located under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has operated under the aegis of my Department since January 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">Since late 2009, the work of the Partnership was integrated into the main structure of my Department.  There has been a budgetary saving of €300,000 which was previously provided in my Department's Vote. The Board has also been re-structured and renamed the Ireland Newfoundland Advisory Council.  The annual budget provided for the INP from 2004 is outlined in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_1290">The Department of the Taoiseach is represented on the Interdepartmental Group on Administrative Burden Reduction.  e Central Statistics Office (CSO) is represented separately on the Group. The Department itself has no legislation that impacts on business.  As the CSO has legislation that impacts on business, they are fully engaged in the burden reduction programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">It should be acknowledged that the compilation of business statistics is absolutely necessary.  Therefore, while it is essential to minimise burdens, it is neither possible nor desirable to completely eliminate burdens of this kind.  In this context, the CSO published a ranked list of 20 information obligations in <i>the Standard Cost Model Report — Measurement of administrative burden imposed on Irish business by Central Statistics Office inquiries</i>.  This report was published in August 2010 and is available on the CSO website.  The report estimates that the total cost of the burden to businesses arising from CSO activity for 2008 (the most recent year available) was €10.8 million using the standard cost model (which assumes full compliance).  The CSO also publishes an annual statement on total burden to business arising from CSO activity.  These reports are available on the CSO website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1293">The Pilot Short Time Working Training Programme was introduced in May 2009. FÁS initially administered the programme, which aimed to provide training to people on systematic short time for the days they are not working.  The programme aimed to provide two days training a week for up to 277 workers over a 52-week period and they received training free of charge for these two days. The Department of Social Protection continues to pay participants social welfare entitlements whilst receiving this training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">In the 2010 budget, FÁS was not allocated funding for the Short Time Working Training Programme, instead Skillnets has been providing for its inclusion in its training networks programme (TNP) of limited numbers of unemployed persons with the emphasis, where possible, on priority cohorts on the live register. It is intended that this will also include provision for some people on reduced working weeks and this supersedes the FÁS Short Time Working Training Programme initiative. Skillnets are now providing training to approximately 4,800 unemployed persons.  Skillnets have embarked on an initiative to provide learning support to the unemployed via existing structures of networks who support the learning needs of the unemployed. This has resulted in a very high standard of quality and depth of the support for the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">In June 2010, Skillnets surveyed unemployed individuals who trained with networks between June and May. 86% of all respondents agreed that the training increased their chances of securing employment. Since completing Skillnets training, one in five people secured work, one in four progressed into further education/training and one in seven became self employed.  FÁS are currently in the process of collating other specific information requested about the Short Time Working Training Programme and when this information becomes available FÁS will forward it directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">The detailed information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and would involve a very significant amount of administrative time to compile.  However, details of public funding disbursements are made available in a range of publications on an annual basis. The Revised Estimates Volume, published annually by the Department of Finance, contains a significant level of detail regarding funding allocations for the year of publication, together with details of funds disbursed by the Exchequer in the previous year. Additionally the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes the Appropriation Accounts, which are the annual accounts of Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">Both the Revised Estimates Volume and the Appropriation Accounts categorise expenditure by Government Department and by subhead designation. Within the subheads categorised, major organisations funded by individual Departmental Votes, including the Vote for my Department, can be identified. Other tables within these publications contain significant further information.  Additionally, on an annual basis, my Department posts on its website details of organisations part-funded from National Lottery funds. In this regard, funding details for the years 2007-2009 are provided in tabular form in the following spreadsheet.  If there is a specific person or body in which the Deputy has a particular interest I would be happy to supply any additional information that is held by my Department in this matter.</p>

This certification is a normal requirement before funding can be provided in relation to school projects.  The dismissal of the Consultant Architect by the school authority has created difficulties in relation to final certification of the satisfactory completion of the project and, consequently, payment of the balance of funding due.

The institutions approved under the scheme are, generally speaking, publicly-funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and post-graduate level. Each year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of institutions approved for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">My Department provides very significant funding to publicly-funded third level institutions in the State. This funding is used to provide a very broad range of courses to meet both economic and societal needs. Private commercial colleges, in general, operate on a "for profit" basis and the State has no say in directing their operations.  Section 8 of the Student Support Bill as published makes provision for the Minister, in certain circumstances and taking certain matters into account, to prescribe an educational institution as being an approved institution for grants purposes.  However, I have no plans to extend the scope of the student grant schemes to private colleges operated on a "for profit" basis at this time.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1819">I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 138 to 140, inclusive, and 157 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The Government has decided to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 and to the merger of particular city and or county VECs.  My Department has commenced work on the preparation of legislation so that it can be brought forward in 2011.  I have framed this restructuring, having regard to the need to address the current low scale and size of operations in particular VECs together with the need to retain and support the flexibility and adaptability which has characterised the VEC sector to date along with the requirement to meet future challenges across the school sector generally.  In addition, geographic factors such as the total area covered by a VEC, the distance between extremities of the area, the road network within the area and the alignment of other regional structures have been taken into account in arriving at these combinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">I am satisfied that the scale of operations of a significant number of VECs makes restructuring of the sector a key priority to ensure that each VEC has the critical mass of activity while at the same time, retaining the flexibility and responsiveness to meet the needs of the population for which it caters.  A VEC's budget for service delivery is the broadest measure of activity.  In order to ensure that each VEC will have the required critical mass of operations under the revised structure, I sought to bring as many of the new VEC areas as possible, taking account of the other criteria outlined earlier to a level of activity which would require a budget of  €50 million.  In this new arrangement, the smallest VEC will have a budget of €39 million and the median for the individual budget measure of scale of operations will move from €26 million at present to €59 million with 13 of the proposed 16 VECs having a budget of €50 million or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">Flexibility and responsiveness to changing and emerging needs has been a general feature of the operation of VECs. I am satisfied that this restructuring of VECs will not only retain and support this demonstrated capacity for flexibility and adaptability but also position the VEC sector to meet future challenges across the school sector generally and the proposed reconfiguration has been framed on that basis.  Some of the likely savings from the restructuring of the VECs will come from the sale of existing VEC buildings.  The potential revenue to be raised from the sale of these assets, however, is closely linked to the current state of the property market and it may not be possible to dispose of such buildings satisfactorily in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">This reconfiguration can over time yield savings in the recurrent cost of the headquarter functions of VECs which at present is of the order of €42 million in total, primarily comprising pay provision. The Special Group suggested savings of €3 million. I am satisfied that a saving of that order is reasonable in the medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">Many of the detailed aspects of the restructuring, including the location of the headquarters of the new VECs and the number of administrative staff which each of the new VEC entities will have, will be considered and worked through by my Department in conjunction with the VECs involved in any one merger before decisions are taken. Implementation will involve consultation and negotiations with the unions representing employees in the sector and other stakeholders. The Croke Park Agreement provides the backdrop for these negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1855">As part of the implementation of the Smart Schools = Smart Economy Report and the 2008 ICT Strategy Report, I recently announced ICT grants of over €20m for post primary schools.  The school referred to by the Deputy received a grant of €12,232. The grant should be used by the school to work towards equipping each classroom in the school with a teaching computer, with a long range wireless mouse and keyboard, and a fixed digital projector with a particular priority to be placed on equipment for use in the teaching of Project Maths.  This latest investment brings the total equipment grant outlay under the ICT in Schools programme to more than €43m within the past twelve months and further grants will issue to primary schools shortly.</p>

Trí líon teoranta bunscoileanna eile a áireamh sa threoirscéim, beidh sé níos fusa fadhbanna praiticiúla a shainaithint agus réitigh nua a thriail.

            <p eId="para_1889">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended by Section 102 of the Finance Act 2010) provided for the introduction, from 1 January 2011, of a revised classification system for the assessment of vehicle registration tax (VRT), which reflects the categories used for classification of vehicles at European level under various EC Directives.  It also brings the definitions of individual vehicles into line with EC definitions and introduces new definitions for certain terms used for vehicle registration tax purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">Accordingly, from 1 January 2011, motorhomes (defined as motor caravans in VRT legislation) with an EC vehicle classification of M1 with a <i>bodytype SA</i> will be charged VRT at 13.3% of the open market selling price of the vehicle in the State.  The Commissioners confirm that <i>unladen weight</i> will no longer be a determining factor in the calculation of VRT on the registration of motor caravans from 1 January 2011.  The Deputy may wish to note that the VRT charged on registration of a vehicle is reduced by the amount of the fee charged by the NCTS to carry out the pre-registration examination and therefore does not result in any additional charge to the customer.  Finally, from 1 January 2011, the 13.3% rate of VRT will be payable on the registration of all motorhomes in the State. </p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1896">On June 2nd last, the European Commission published a proposal to amend the existing Regulation governing the activities of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs). This proposal is currently being examined at Council working group level, as well as within the European Parliament under the co-decision process.  The proposal is principally a technical measure to allow the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to assume responsibility for the regulation of CRAs which operate in the EU. ESMA, which is being established as part of the implementation of the recommendations of the de Larosière Report on financial supervision, will become operational at the start of 2011. The proposal amends the existing CRA Regulation (No. 1060/2009) in which national competent authorities (i.e. central banks or financial regulators) were responsible for supervising the activities of CRAs. The national competent authorities will be required to co-operate with ESMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">The proposal also seeks to put in place a provision whereby national competent authorities would be required to ensure that all regulated financial institutions, which use ratings produced by CRAs, comply with certain requirements when using those ratings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">The proposal also introduces greater transparency on the ratings provided for structured financial products (e.g. asset backed securities). This obligation, which is already in place in some non-EU jurisdictions, will help avoid possible conflicts of interest, for instance, where CRAs are paid by issuers to produce ratings, and will enhance the transparency and quality of ratings. Ireland has supported the basic thrust of the proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899">The main issue which is emerging is in relation to the treatment of ratings produced in countries outside the EU. Some Member States believe that the regulatory regime for non-EU countries should be equivalent to the European model, whereas others consider that ESMA's endorsement of these regulatory regimes should be sufficient. Ireland is in the latter camp.  The Council working group discussions are progressing well and the Belgian Presidency has indicated its desire to achieve agreement on this proposal before the end of the year.</p>

         the tax or VAT concessions available to a person returning to the workforce as self-employed sole trader after being unemployed for over 12 months following redundancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [39667/10]

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_510">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1901">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in relation to income tax, there is no specific relief or allowance available to a person returning to the workforce as a self-employed sole trader after being unemployed for over 12 months following redundancy.  However, the rules governing the submission of tax returns provide a concession for new business in respect of the first tax year.  In general, failure to submit a tax return for a year by 31 October in the following year will result in a surcharge being added to the final tax bill for the year.  However, in the case of a new business, the surcharge will not be imposed if the return for the first tax year is made by the return filing date for the following tax year i.e. by 31 October in the second year after the year in which the sole trade started.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">The rules governing the payment of preliminary tax can also <i> </i>facilitate start-up business in terms of cash flow.  A person has the option of paying preliminary tax on 31 October in the tax year in which trade commences based on either (i) 90 per cent of the liability for the year or (ii) 100 per cent of the liability for the previous year, in order that interest charges will not apply. Where the person opts for the 100 per cent rule, the preliminary tax payment required for the first year can be nil where that person had no taxable income in the year prior to the year in which the trade started.  Additionally, where the person wishes to pay preliminary tax in the first year of trade, the person can pay by way of direct debit monthly instalments. This facility is designed to spread the burden of payment throughout the tax year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">In so far as VAT is concerned, there are no concessions for a person who commences business as a sole trader following unemployment — the normal VAT rules apply. Where a person is supplying taxable goods or services and certain turnover thresholds (€37,500 for services and €75,000 for goods) are exceeded, or are likely to be exceeded, in any 12-month period, then, the person is obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate or rates on his or her supplies of taxable goods and services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1905">I assume the Deputy is referring to the income level at which a third rate of income tax of 48% would have to apply in order to raise €5 billion, €10 billion and €15 billion.  The position is that it would not be possible to raise yields in the order of magnitude the Deputy has outlined by introducing a third rate of income tax of 48% without restructuring the current rate band system.  Alternatively, if the 41% rate in its current structure was increased to 48% it would yield in the region of €1.3 billion in a full year, estimated by reference to 2011 incomes.  A third rate above this income level would raise even less.  This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011. It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1933">Under the current interest terms, it is estimated that the total interest accruing into 2010 in respect of the Promissory Notes issued to date to Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Educational Building Society is around €560 million.  The appropriate accounting treatment of these Promissory Notes under General Government accounting rules is currently under active consideration between the Irish authorities and Eurostat.  However, under the current terms of the coupons on the Notes it is estimated that the annual accrued interest element will initially be of the order of €1½ to €1 ¾ billion before declining in future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">The additional capital required by Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society which I set out in my Statement on Banking on 30 September will be provided largely by an increase in the value of the Promissory Notes. It is, however, not possible to determine the future interest liability which this will give rise to as it will depend on the appropriate Irish Government 10 Year Bond Yield at the time of issue as well as the outcome of the Irish authorities discussion with Eurostat on the General Government accounting treatment of the Notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">The impact of the Promissory Notes on the agreed target to achieve a General Government deficit of below 3% of GDP by the end of 2014, and their accounting treatment will be finalised by the Department of Finance in the context of preparations for the Four-Year Plan for Budgets and Economic Growth. However, in broad terms taking account of the Promissory Notes means that the deficit will be impacted by about 1% of GDP over the forecast period.</p>

Having said that, the Central Statistics Office in compiling estimates of national income, and in line with best international practice, makes adjustments to the figures in order to control for informal activity in some sub-sectors of the economy.  This is done at a very detailed level, with the result that an overall economy-wide estimate is not available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1939">The detailed macro-economic and fiscal projections for the period 2011-2014 are currently being revised by my Department in the context of the publication of the Government's Four-Year Plan. Projections for debt servicing interest costs are not currently available for the period beyond 2014.  While the up-to-date forecasts are still being finalised, the debt servicing costs previously set out are informative. Based on the Budget 2010 estimates, a table outlines the debt servicing interest costs for the period to end-2014 as calculated by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) at that time. In respect of the forecast for 2010, on advice from the NTMA, my Department has already signalled publicly that debt interest costs in 2010 will be approximately €350 million lower than was forecast at Budget time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the scheme of capital allowances introduced to support the construction of student accomodation.  My Department is not involved in the payment of grants for the provision of student accommodation.  Section 50 Finance Act 1999 introduced a scheme of tax relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students.  The relief provided for a deduction of 100% of the construction, conversion or refurbishment expenditure, which could be off-set against all Irish rental income — whether derived from the premises in question or from other lettings.  The purpose of the relief was to increase the supply of quality accommodation for third level students and the scheme was very successful in that respect.  The scheme was abolished by Finance Act 2006 with a final termination date of 31 July 2008 for qualifying capital expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available on the cost to the Exchequer of the property based tax relief for the provision of student accommodation is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers and corporation tax returns filed by companies for the years 2004 to 2008, the latest year for which this information is available. These are set out in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2417">On foot of an open EU procurement exercise, my Department put in place a framework for the provision of mobile voice and data services to the entire Irish public service in February 2008.  Framework agreements were awarded to three providers — Vodafone, O2, and Meteor.  In September 2008, my Department met with Meteor to express its dissatisfaction with Meteor's performance under the framework in terms of the services it was offering and the price levels it was demanding.  My Department was concerned that Meteor was not responding to the bulk of procurement competitions operated under the framework, and had not been successful in any, arising from its policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">As Meteor was not in a position to rectify these matters or give an indication of how or when it could do so, the Government Networks Programme Board, which is chaired by my Department, agreed to the suspension of Meteor indefinitely from the framework in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Vendor Particpation Agreement governing the framework.  Meteor was notified of this decision in October 2008, and was informed that my Department would be willing to review the suspension on notification from Meteor of changes that would rectify the causes for suspension.  Meteor has not responded to that opportunity to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_2422">My Department, in accordance with Government policy has a procurement policy for the acquisition of all ICT products and services.  A procurement exercise must be undertaken based on functional requirements for all software, i.e. not a specific technology brand.  The evaluation of such a procurement exercise is conducted on as close to a total cost of ownership (TCO) model as possible and at a minimum includes the following costs: licensing; arising hardware upgrades/ renewals/replacements; IT and user training; support and maintenance; planning, testing and migration; external expertise; and exit costs.  My Department has not incurred any expenditure on desktop operating system or productivity software (wordprocessing, spreadsheets, presentation software, email client, etc...) in the last 6 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">My Department runs a competitive tender exercise each year advertised on the eTenders website for the supply of printer consumables so as to achieve the best value for money.  This tender is evaluated with a high emphasis on the cost of supplying the manufacturer's brand of toner as this is the only way of achieving a like with like comparison between the offerings of each vendor.  The National Procurement Service is currently establishing a printer consumable framework for the Public Service which is expected to be completed early in 2011, and it is my Department's intention to use this framework for future procurement.  The evaluation criteria to be used on the framework will be based on the cost of the manufacturer's brand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">The principal reason for not using generic consumables is the potential for voiding the manufacturer's warranty.  Many studies have been carried out on the use of generic consumables and reasons for not using them include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">Generic toners often cannot produce the same quality as genuine toners.  Some generic cartridges that have been designed poorly can lead to toner leaks and printer malfunctions; often these faults brought in by inferior parts will also void the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">Generic toners can cost more in the long run.  One in four remanufactured or refilled cartridges are dead on arrival or fail prematurely and that almost 30% of pages printed from remanufactured toner cartridges were of limited or no use due to poor print quality, which lead to reprints.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">Increased paper usage and paper costs can erode any cost benefit of cheaper toner. Generic toners are also more likely to cause problems with the printer when they cannot effectively emulate patented printer technology resulting in increased printer downtime and repair costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2428">Printer blockages, unusable messy printouts and increased print tests are common side affects from generic toners. These are problems that are much less likely to occur using the original manufacturer's toners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2432">The Valuation Act 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property.   As you will appreciate, the Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis as provided for in the Valuation Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_2433">The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed last year and Dún Laoghaire- Rathdown will be completed this year (2010). In the coming months the programme will be rolled out to further local authorities. The necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is underway in Dublin City and in the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also underway on the revaluation of Limerick City.</p>
            <p eId="para_2434">The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and following completion of the initial national revaluation programme, I am satisfied that there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and that this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of the recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">The Commissioner is confident that the national revaluation programme can be delivered in a ten-year period, which accords with relevant provisions of the Act, but is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for delivery within a shorter timeframe.</p>

My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area including extending an appropriate regulatory and tax regime to betting exchanges.  Any extension of betting duty will be applied on a fair basis and should not be perceived as an attempt to threaten jobs.  Also, tax changes will be in tandem with ongoing work by the Department of Justice and Law Reform on issues surrounding licensing and regulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2507">In accordance with the relevant EU Directive the overall excise duty on cigarettes is made up of a specific (fixed) element and an <i>ad valorem</i> element. Ireland already applies a high specific duty element and a low ad valorem element in setting its excise duty for cigarettes relative to other Member States. It is intended to continue that approach in setting our excise duty for cigarettes.    It has also to be recognised that Ireland has the highest prices and excise duty levels for cigarettes in the EU. For example the level of excise duty on cigarettes in Ireland (€5.22 for a packet of 20) is double that in Sweden, and slightly less than double that in The Netherlands.</p>

            <p eId="para_2509">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2011 incomes, of a 1% point increase in the top rate of income tax for those single individuals with incomes over €100,000 and married couples with incomes over €200,000 as referred to by the Deputy would be of the order of €57 million. Consequently, the top rate of income tax would need to increase to 59%, 76% and 111% to yield in the region of €1 billion, €2 billion and €4 billion in a full year respectively. These estimates are based on confining the increased tax rate to the segment of income that is in excess of the stated thresholds of €100,000 and €200,000.    These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised.  It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p>

            <p eId="para_2516">The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the accompanying table.  The yield from these three tax-heads increased steadily during the first half of the decade, to peak at a combined amount of just under €7.2 billion in 2006. However, this figure had fallen to just €1.7 billion in 2009, a decline of over 75 per cent. Between their peak in 2007 and 2009, total tax revenues fell by approximately 30 per cent. Consequently, a significant gap has emerged between revenues and expenditures. The Government has already taken very significant action to tackle this shortfall but further efforts will be required and the Four-Year Plan for Budgets and Economic Growth, which will be published later this month, will set out the measures necessary for us to reach our target of a General Government deficit of 3 per cent of GDP by end-2014.</p>

The pension scheme in place comes under the scope of a public service pension scheme as defined in section 1 of the Act ‘provided for under an administrative measure to like effect as the Superannuation Acts'.</p>

            <p eId="para_3253">There are a range of financial supports in place which are designed specifically to address the issue of additional costs associated with disabilities including weekly/monthly allowances, additional income supports, other benefits such as medical cards/free travel/mobility allowance and tax concessions.  It is important to be aware that the provision of a cost of disability payment raises a number of very complex questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3254">Not all people with disabilities incur additional costs, nor do they incur costs to the same extent.  A national system of needs assessment is a prerequisite for any cost of disability payment scheme.  The Government was committed to considering the issues around the feasibility of cost of disability payment following the development of the needs assessment system provided for in the Disability Act.  However, with the major changes in the economic environment and  the deferral of the implementation of the Disability Act, the Government is not in a position to progress consideration of the feasability of introducing a cost of disability payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 to 218, inclusive, 256 and 276 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">The Government will be considering the 2011 Estimates for the health service over the coming weeks in the context of its strategy for economic recovery and its target to reduce the general government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs and to support ongoing reform of the public health services within the resources available for health.  To achieve this, staff at all levels will have to work together to deliver services in a more flexible way.  It is essential that the impact on frontline services of any cuts is minimised while ensuring that the needs of service users remains the highest priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">The HSE is working within limited financial resources.  The appropriate management of the public finances means that the health sector, which represents over 27% of public expenditure, must operate within the approved budget set out at the start of the year.  Under Section 31(1) of the Health Act, 2004, the HSE is required to prepare an annual National Service Plan.  The Plan, which must indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the HSE, is submitted to the Minister for Health and Children for approval.  The appropriate management of the health services also means that the mental health services must be funded in an equitable and sustainable manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">The estimated cost of the implementation of <i>‘A Vision for Change</i>’ is €150m over 7 — 10 years.  Development funding totalling €54 million has been allocated to the HSE since the launch of the Report in 2006.  In addition, almost €1 million was allocated this year under the Dormant Accounts Fund for a programme of suicide prevention measures to help communities to develop integrated local action plans for suicide prevention.  To further the implementation of <i>‘A Vision for Change’</i>, the 2010 Employment Control Framework for the health service provided an exemption from the moratorium on recruitment and allowed 100 psychiatric posts to be filled by nurses or therapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">There are substantial resources already invested in mental health.  The reconfiguring and remodelling of these resources will be the main focus for the immediate future. While implementation of <i>‘A Vision for Change’</i>   has been somewhat slower than originally anticipated it is important to say that in many parts of the country, services are pressing ahead with the implementation of the policy.  Significant progress has been achieved including: shorter episodes of inpatient care, improved child and adolescent mental health services, fewer involuntary admissions and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.  Acute admissions to St Brendan’s Hospital have ceased.  Plans for the transfer of acute inpatient admissions from St Ita’s Hospital to a new purpose built unit on the Beaumont Hospital Campus are proceeding.  New Community Nursing Units in Ballinasloe and Mullingar have been developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3267">The number of child and adolescent inpatient beds will increase from 30 to 52 before the end of 2010.  This together with the Mental Health Commission code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 will greatly reduce the need to admit children to adult units.</p>

            <p eId="para_3271">I met with the Jack and Jill Foundation on Tuesday 12th October last.  The Health Service Executive was also represented at the meeting.  We discussed a range of issues including additional State funding.  I will continue to engage with the Jack and Jill Foundation.  Both the Minister and I and the Health Service Executive recognise the valuable contribution that the many agencies and charities make in the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3272">Reflecting the current economic situation the health sector must manage service levels within available resources.  The HSE together with the ‘non-statutory organisations' who provide services on behalf of the HSE, will continue to review how these services are provided in order to protect the delivery of front line services as much as possible.  In the current environment, this is a challenge for all, including the HSE and non statutory charity organisations.  The HSE will continue to work closely with all agencies and bodies in the sector, including Jack and Jill, to provide whatever assistance it can from within its resources, in the context of the annual Service Level Agreement arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3273">The very difficult financial position facing the country will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure, including the disability sector. Notwithstanding this difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect patient services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs, and to support ongoing reform of the public heath services within the resources available for health.</p>

            <p eId="para_3277">The Health Service Executive (HSE), with my full support, decided to centralise the processing of all medical cards and GP visit card applications and renewals to its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  In January 2009, the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  In September 2009, the processing of all applications from two Local Health Offices in Dublin transferred to the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">In June 2010, the HSE introduced a new website, www.medicalcard.ie, which enables people anywhere in the country to apply for a medical card through a simple and efficient online application process.  Online assessments are immediate and for applicants who supply all evidence/documentation and are eligible on income grounds, medical card delivery is guaranteed within 15 days of receipt of the completed application pack.  The HSE has also made provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately.  The PCRS is receiving approximately 3,000 applications each week via this new channel, with more than 50% of these being made outside normal office hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">Significant progress has been made in this national project in providing an improved service to the public at less cost to the State.  Up to 8th October 2010, the PCRS has received 211,801 medical card applications and reviews and issued 171,237 medical cards.  The next phase of the project will move the processing of all new applications to the Central Office following a consultative process with staff representatives in line with the recent agreement on pay and reform in the public service.  As the centralisation process continues, more initiatives will be introduced and the current initiatives will continue to be enhanced as the HSE receives feedback and continues to engage closely with advocacy groups, staff, public representatives and primary care contractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">When the centralisation process is finalised (estimated completion date is 31st March 2011), staff in Local Health Offices will continue to have access to the national system and will be available to help clients with enquiries about their application or review and will also be able to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme.</p>

Prior to 2009, details of all recipients of lottery grants were set out in the Appropriation Account of my Department.  Following a decision by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Appropriation Accounts no longer provide this detail, but require each Department to publish this information.

The scientific literature would suggest that there is no additional public health benefit in starting screening below the age of 25 years and published research in fact has shown that the disadvantages of screening women under the age of 25 years may be greater than any potential benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">The NCSS keeps under constant review the evidence base, involving any research conducted in Ireland or internationally, that would influence the target population for CervicalCheck.  CervicalCheck is a programme for women without symptoms. Irrespective of her age, any woman who has symptoms causing concern should seek the advice of her doctor.</p>

The Executive indicated that it temporarily closed the Day-care Service at the Plunkett Community Nursing Unit in Boyle from Monday March 8th.  The HSE appreciates that this is an inconvenience for clients of this service but there must be appropriate staffing levels to run any service safely.  The Executive has indicated that it is unable to re-open this facility at present as there are a number of vacancies in the service and it has not been able to recruit appropriate staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_3402">It is important to note that these figures are not directly comparable, as following the establishment of the Health Service Executive in 2005 the programme breakdown in the Revised Estimates Volumes changed.  Up to 2004 (2003 outturn figures) the programme breakdown provided was in relation to the "General Hospital Programme" and included services provided in district hospitals, county hospitals and long-stay hospitals.  Many of the costs related to these areas are now reflected in other programmes, such as care of older people and the mental health programme.   Following the establishment of the HSE, the programme breakdown  for hospitals is now the acute sector only, with long-stay and other residential services reflected in other programmes.  It should also be noted that the figure for 2010 includes savings arising from public service pay reductions and other economies.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_3446">I met with members of the Save Wicklow Hospital Campaign and local public representatives to discuss the proposed closure of Wicklow Community Hospital on 27th October 2010.  Wicklow Community Hospital, built in the 1940s, currently provides 26 long stay care beds, 4 respite care beds and 1 palliative care bed.  HSE Management commissioned two reports recently arising from concerns in relation to the physical infrastructure of the residential unit at the Hospital.  One was a comprehensive architectural survey and the other a report in relation to Fire Safety compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3447">While the Architectural Survey is still underway, the Fire Safety report was completed and submitted on 14th October.  It found approximately 80 issues requiring significant and urgent attention. In addition, it became clear that if works were undertaken to bring the current building up to meet the requirements under the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People the likely numbers of residents that could be accommodated at the Hospital would be reduced to between 10 and 12 which would render the residential element of the Hospital unviable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3448">Consequently, the HSE has decided that the best option is to close the hospital and informed HIQA of this decision on 22nd October.  The HSE has met with representatives of residents, and Wicklow Public Representatives. Staff representative bodies have also been apprised of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449">The welfare of the residents is the primary concern.  The Director of Nursing and her Assistant Director, who know the residents and their familes, informed them of the decision. The Director of Nursing and her staff continue to make themselves available at all times to the residents and their families in supporting them through the transfer process.  A helpline phone number has been set up and given to the residents and their families. They have been offered a choice in relation to their future homes.  Currently most of the residents have chosen to move to St. Colman's, Rathdrum, or to Blainroe Nursing Home in Wicklow.</p>
            <p eId="para_3450">Residents are being assessed by the staff from the units where they will make their new homes to ensure that their assessed needs can be met.  The General Practitioners who provide a medical service to the residents have also been informed.  Suitable transfer arrangements will be facilitated for the residents when they are ready to transfer to their new homes. They will be accompanied by appropriate staff from Wicklow Hospital to ensure continuity of care in relation to their needs as indicated in their individual care plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_3454">I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which provides for a free pre-school year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3455">Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months in September of the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 are eligible for the free pre-school year which commenced in September 2010 and children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 will be eligible in September 2011.  The child in question will be eligible in September 2011 but if her parents decide to send her to primary school at that time she will not be able benefit from the ECCE scheme.  There is no provision under the scheme  to enrol children that are below the qualifying age.</p>
            <p eId="para_3456">The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the year before they commence primary school.  Services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the pre-school year at a particular age cohort and to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children participate in the scheme.   In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the variation in school admission policies and the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_3487">I recognise the valuable contribution made by the many agencies and charities to the provision of health and personal social services for people with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">Reflecting the current economic situation the HSE must manage service levels within available resources.  In the current environment, this is a challenge for all, including the HSE and non statutory charity organisations.  By working together and finding innovative ways to provide value for money we can help to protect services.  With this in mind we must improve the efficiency and effectiveness of disability funding.  There are many organisations providing services to people with a disability.  It is essential that organisations operate models of service that maximise the significant resources available.  The HSE will work closely with all agencies and bodies in the sector to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness, in the context of the annual Service Level Agreement arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3489">Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are continuing in the context of the forthcoming Budget.  The very difficult financial position facing the country will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure, including the disability sector. Notwithstanding this difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect patient services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs, and to support ongoing reform of the public heath services within the resources available for health.</p>

In key areas such as web site and some database systems, where skill sets are available, considerable use is made of open source software.  It is difficult to evaluate the savings made in deploying these products due to the variety of comparative technologies available on the market but I am confident they are more economical to deploy and maintain.  In relation to consumables, it is intended to purchase via the National Procurement Service consumables tender as soon as their procurement framework exercise is finalised early in the new year.  It is planned to exhaust all current stocks of consumables and any requirements in the interim will be made via a small draw down arrangement until the new framework is in place.  My Department earlier this year has evaluated the concept of a managed print service and the use of generic consumables to achieve better value for money but has decided to approach the issue via the proposed framework agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_3518">A medical card as issued by the Health Service Executive (HSE), confirms that the holder is entitled, free of charge, to a range of health services, which includes:</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">General medical and surgical services including all in-patient services and out-patient services in a public ward in a public hospital (including consultant services);</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">A choice of general practitioners (GP) from those doctors who have a General Medical Services (GMS) contract with the HSE;</p>

            <p eId="para_3522">Dental, Ophthalmic and Aural services</p>
            <p eId="para_3523">GPs who hold GMS contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3524">The contract between the HSE and GPs under the GMS Scheme stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".</p>
            <p eId="para_3525">Consultation fees charged by GPs to GMS patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect general practitioners to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  My colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has also called on providers of professional services in the private sector to adjust their fees in line with the reductions in fees of those providing such services in the public sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_3573">The Government decided to limit the funding available to the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups.  Services for high-risk patients and those requiring exceptional care continue to be available.  The remaining care provision, which is subject to prior approval from a clinician in the HSE, prioritises high risk and exceptional patients, plus patients requiring emergency care, and patients who are considered to have greater clinical urgency and/or necessity in receiving care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3574">Treatments that are not available under the DTSS may be obtained privately.  While consultation fees for such treatments are a matter between individual dentists and their patients, I would expect dentists to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting such fees.  My colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has also called on providers of professional services in the private sector to adjust their fees in line with the reductions in fees in the public sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_3689">The person who is subject of this question was granted permission to remain in the State pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 2004, following consideration of an application made to the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) under the Irish Born Child Scheme (IBC/05). Such permission is granted subject to condition that the person receiving such permission does not contravene the laws of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">On 15th January 2010 the person attended at Kildare Garda Station to register a renewal of his permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Renewal Scheme 2010. However in view of an incident which resulted in the person being convicted of an offence contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 and which is subject of an ongoing appeal, the Immigration Officer granted the person a permission for six months, pending the outcome of that appeal. A second permission, for six months, was again granted to the person on 19th August, 2010, as the appeal had still not been determined by the Courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3691">The requirement to pay a prescribed fee in respect of the issuing of a registration certificate is provided for in the Immigration Act 2004 (Registration Certificate Fee) Regulations 2008 (S.I.

Comprehensive information relating to making an application for a re-entry visa is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service ( www.inis.gov.ie ).  The cost for a single journey re-entry visa  is €60.00 whilst a multiple journey re-entry visa may be obtained at a fee of  €100.00.</p>
            <p eId="para_3693">A multiple-re-entry visa can be applied for once the applicant is registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau ( GNIB ).

            <p eId="para_3698">I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3699">The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009. At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3700">The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand. Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process. However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 12 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3701">The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis. In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are kept under review.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3717">The fact that current law governing gaming is outdated and in need of reform if it is to reflect the realities of a modern gaming sector, including gaming over the internet, is one of the reasons why I initiated a review of gambling.  That review is currently underway in my Department and addresses reform of the gaming and other sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3718">The objective of the wide-ranging review is to provide Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing the gambling architecture in the State.  As I have already pointed out in this House, in reply to previous Questions, it is a matter of record that successive Governments have shied away from attempting any significant reform of our gambling laws since our existing gaming and lotteries legislation was enacted over 50 years ago.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, I am resolved to make our gambling laws relevant to the 21st century.  In light of this commitment, I feel we must take the time to make sure this is done effectively.  We must first achieve a policy in relation to a new gambling architecture that is capable of winning broad spectrum agreement.  It is when this goal is achieved that we will be in a position to address the matter of legislative change, with some degree of confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3719">Any such new policy aimed at modernising our gambling code must take account of the issues raised by new technologies, particularly the internet.  In addition, policy must also be premised on the three important considerations which are the hallmark of most well-regulated gambling codes.  These are:</p>
            <p eId="para_3720">that young people and the vulnerable are protected</p>
            <p eId="para_3721">that gambling should, in all respects, be fairly and openly conducted and</p>
            <p eId="para_3722">that gambling is kept free of crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_3723">While taxation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance, it can be anticipated that as far as regulatory compliance is concerned there will be no question of disadvantaging domestic or Irish operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_3724">As the Deputy is no doubt aware, and as  I have pointed out on previous occasions in this House, it is a matter for the Garda Síochána to investigate breaches of our current gaming legislation and to take whatever action is deemed appropriate.  I have been assured that gaming premises receive Garda attention and if breaches of the legislation are detected appropriate action is taken.  I invite the Deputy, if he has information about any specific breaches of the relevant provisions of the Acts, to bring this to the attention of the Gardaí.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that should the law need to be changed to ensure an appropriate level of enforcement or control of gaming, I will not hesitate to do so as part of the outcome of the review of gambling currently underway.  In that context, may I say that following the settling of policy, arrangements will be made in the normal course to address the necessary legislative change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3725">As the first comprehensive review of our gambling law, effectively since the enactment of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, draws to a close, it is reasonable to expect that any new legislation that may arise, will be both complex and comprehensive.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 184 of 29 April 2010 in which he stated that it was not his Department’s responsibility to legislate against forced marriage if he will reconsider his reply in view of reports of two Latvian women being trafficked into Ireland and falsely imprisoned for the purpose of forcing them into marriage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3727">I am of course aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.   As he will understand, this matter is the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific aspects of the case or on any possible criminal charges that might arise.   Also, as I outlined in my earlier reply, my Department does not have responsibility for marriage registration.   That said however, I can outline the general position in the criminal law where a person is held against their will with a view of forcing them into marriage. There is not on the statute book a composite offence of holding someone against their will with a view to forcing them to marry.  However a person who engages in this activity would be in breach of existing criminal laws in respect of its  constituent elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3728">False imprisonment, which essentially consists of restricting the personal liberty of another person, is an offence under section 15 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and carries a life sentence.  Unlawfully intimidating a person with a view to compelling him or her to do something which he or she has a right not to do, e.g. attend a marriage ceremony, amounts to coercion, which is an offence under section 9 of the 1997 Act punishable by a fine and up to five years in prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_3729">The seriousness of the offence of false imprisonment is also marked by the additional provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The 2007 Act allows for a person suspected of false imprisonment to be detained by Gardai for investigative purposes for up to seven days (subject to judicial authorisation).   It also provides for the courts to make Monitoring Orders for persons convicted of false imprisonment. Courts may also make Protection Of Persons Orders prohibiting offenders from engaging in any behaviour that would cause the victim of the offence fear, distress, alarm or intimidation.  The same Act provides mandatory minimum sentences for repeat offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3730">The whole area of marriages of convenience is a complex one and there are no easy solutions.  It is a question of adopting a number of complementary strategies including international police co-operation.   In addition to the criminal sanctions as outlined above, where coercion is found in time then the marriage can be prevented.  If a marriage has taken place and is later found to have involved coercion then any immigration benefit can be withdrawn.</p>

            <p eId="para_3740">Comprehensive guidance in relation to the current visa arrangements applicable to Chinese citizens is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).</p>
            <p eId="para_3741">As with all visas in all countries worldwide, the central concern is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time not placing unnecessary or unreasonable obstacles in the way of those who intend travelling for legitimate purposes and who are likely to abide by the terms of their visa.  Each visa application is decided on its individual merits and I believe that, in most cases, my Department achieves this balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3742">Currently, straightforward ‘visit' visa applications are being decided upon within 10 working days by the Visa Office, Beijing.  The decision time frame is even shorter where applications are lodged via a Chinese government approved tourist agent, such applications being decided upon within 1-3 working days.  The current processing time for straightforward ‘study' visa applications is 20 working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_3743">My Department continually examines ways in which the visa process can facilitate the promotion of tourism in the State, including in cooperation with the United Kingdom with which we have a common travel area, in conformity with the needs of an effective immigration regime.  In this respect, as the Deputy will be aware,  a document entitled "New Immigration Regime For Full Time Non-EEA Students" was launched by the Government on 22 September.   This was in tandem with the Government's 5 year strategy document " Investing in Global Relationships — Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010–15".   Copies of these documents are available from the websites of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Department of Education and Skills respectively.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3748">Arrangements for the management of registered sex offenders is a matter which I discuss regularly with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, including under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters.  We share a determination that the border should not be used in any way by such individuals to evade their obligations. To this end there is close co-operation between the two police forces and probation services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3749">The management of registered sex offenders is one of the discrete areas of co-operation under the Agreement.  A Registered Offenders Project Advisory Group, co-chaired by senior members of An Garda Síochána and PSNI and including representatives of other relevant criminal justice agencies, takes directly responsibility for ensuring that the two jurisdictions work closely together on this issue.  This work is overseen by the Working Group which co-ordinates overall policy in relation to North-South criminal justice co-operation and which reports directly to Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3750">The Sex Offenders Act 2001 already contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  The Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State, including from Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3751">My Department is working on proposals for the greater approximation of the laws North and South of the border in relation to the respective notification systems so that sex offenders can gain no advantage living either side of the border.  Currently, the notification period for the purposes of the sex offenders register in this jurisdiction is 7 days. I propose to reduce this period to 3 days to bring it into line with requirements in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_3752">An Garda Síochána has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to the current requirements.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions.  The Unit maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3753">The Probation Service works closely with An Garda Síochána and has developed common risk assessment instruments related to the management of sex offenders which match those used by the probation and police services in Northern Ireland.  Best practice indicates that different jurisdictions as well as different agencies within jurisdictions should use the same risk assessment instruments so as to support effective communication.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">An Garda Síochána and the PSNI maintain close contact and exchange intelligence on convicted sex offenders.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the Irish and British Governments in 2006 on the sharing between An Garda Síochána and British police forces, including the PSNI, of information on sex offenders.  An Garda Síochána and the PSNI have subsequently signed an agreement on the sharing of personal data in relation to the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders.</p>

Approximately 1,100 cases in the system are there five years or more following the finalisation of their asylum application.  This represents some 11% of all such cases.  It should be borne in mind that many of these cases are the subject of legal actions instigated by the applicants which must first be dealt with by the Courts before my Department can proceed to finalise them.</p>

            <p eId="para_3765">A visa transaction, as referred to in my reply to Parliamentary Question 355 on 19 October 2010 is a single visa application.  When completing the first stage of the visa application process (an on-line visa application form) an applicant is assigned a unique visa transaction number.  This detail is unique to the application concerned and must be provided where a query on the status or other inquiry regarding a visa application arises.  The provision of this unique visa transaction number ensures that accurate and current information is provided to the authorised inquirer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3766">It is worth reiterating that the figures referred to in my response to Parliamentary Question 355 relate to visa transactions, for non-EEA nationals, resulting in approval decisions and do not refer to unique individuals.  There may be instances where a visa applicant may have made multiple applications.  Each of these would count as a transaction but, for the reasons outlined above, it cannot be taken that the number of transactions equals the number of persons granted visas in any one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3767">For those students requiring a visa, while the subject to be studied and the level of qualification to be obtained are essential considerations in deciding individual study visa applications, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) does not routinely produce statistical reports of visa applications using the parameters of course title, awarding body or level of qualification.  Although the information requested by the Deputy is, therefore, not readily available, analysis carried out as part of the Final Report and Recommendations into a New Immigration Regime for Full-Time Non-EEA Students may be useful.  This analysis showed that there were 12,555 non-EEA students enrolled in higher education courses in October 2008, 13,412 in March 2009 and 12,888  in March 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_3769">I should point out that the applications referred to by the Deputy can be based on marriages which do not necessarily have to have taken place in Ireland.  My Department does not keep records in such a way that would allow the ready separation of applications based on the location of the marriage.  Records in relation to the number of non-EU nationals who married in Ireland in 2010 are held by the General Registrars Office which is under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_3770">However, I can inform the Deputy that to end-September 2010 there were 1,950 applications made by non-EU nationals for residency under EU Treaty Rights, of which 1,487 involved spousal applications.  For the same period in 2010  there were 1,193 applications granted, with 542 applications being refused and 167 not accepted or withdrawn.  Some of these decisions would have related to applications carried over from 2009.  At the end of September 2010, there were 1,158 applications on hands awaiting a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3771">Refusals were due to non-compliance with Directive 2004/35/EC on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (the "Directive") and the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 and 2008 (the "Regulations") which transposed the Directive into Irish law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3772">My Department has prepared statistical information in response to the Deputy's query including a table giving a breakdown by applications based on marriage by the top ten applicants by nationality and by spousal nationality for 2010 and a further two tables give the top ten nationality and gender analysis of EU Treaty Rights applicants based on marriage for 2010.  The Deputy will appreciate that the details in this regard are too extensive for inclusion on the normal electronic system for answering Parliamentary Questions.  I have, however, made arrangements to have this portion of my reply delivered under separate cover to the Deputy in manuscript form.</p>
            <p eId="para_3773">For the Deputy's information, certain information on the situation this year, up to 30 September 2010, has been extrapolated from the statistical tables prepared.  Pakistani nationals have made the most applications — 286 — based on marriage to an EU citizen with 128 of those applications based on marriage to a Latvian national.  Of those 286 Pakistani applicants, 266 were male and 20 were female.  The second highest number of applications was made by Nigerian nationals with 185 applications being made based on marriage to an EU citizen with 40 of those applications based on being married to a English national.  Of those 185 Nigerian applicants, 121 were male and 64 were female.  In total, 293 Latvian spouses have been attached to applications for EU Treaty Rights with 47 being male and 246 being female.  There were 227 English  spouses attached to applications for EU Treaty Rights with 118 being male and 109 being female.</p>

            <p eId="para_3782">Long Term Residency is granted on the basis that a non-EEA national has completed five years legal residency in the State on work permit work/work authorisation/working visa conditions. Residency is calculated from the corresponding Stamp 1 or Stamp 4 endorsements in an applicant's passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each work permit. Periods of time where a person has not had legal residency cannot be counted in any application for Long Term Residency.  On this basis, the person referred to had less than one year's applicable residence and did not satisfy the criteria for obtaining Long Term Residency.  A letter setting out the position in this regard issued to the person concerned on 26/10/2010.  It is of course open to him to reapply for Long Term Residency when he satisfies the above-mentioned criteria.</p>

It invited the President of the European Council to undertake consultations on a limited treaty change to give effect to this, while specifying that article 125 of the Treaty on Functioning of the EU (the "no bail-out" clause) should not be modified in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3817">The Commission is to undertake preparatory work on the general features of a new mechanism including the role of the private sector, the role of the IMF and the very strong conditionality that would apply to associated programmes.  The European Council is to return to the matter in December with a view to taking a decision on treaty amendment so that a change can be ratified by mid-2013 at the latest.  It is intended that the change to the Treaty be limited, and it would not give rise to a new EU Constitutional Treaty.</p>

          if his attention has been drawn to reports that preparations for the referendum to decide the future of south Sudan and the peoples of that region due to take place on 9 January 2011 have not been adequate; the action Ireland is taking bilaterally and through the EU to ensure that preparations are supported to ensure the process is legitimate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3819">The north-south peace process in Sudan is at a critical juncture as the country prepares for a referendum on self-determination for the South and a separate referendum on the status of the district of Abyei on 9 January 2011.  The referenda are envisaged by the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) which brought an end to the north-south conflict in Sudan.  Ireland and the EU believe that full implementation of the CPA is fundamental to securing peace and stability in Sudan as a whole and in the wider region. This is a position shared by a wide range of countries, including the United States and the Member States of the African Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_3820">Preparations for the two referenda have commenced. Voter registration will begin on 14 November and the electoral register is scheduled to be finalised on 31 November. The Referendum Commission for South Sudan has commenced its work and preparation of approximately 3,600 polling stations in Sudan is underway. Electoral materials have been prepared and pre-positioned within Sudan for distribution to the polling stations. However, much remains to be achieved in the remaining time, in particular arrangements for the conduct of the referendum in Abyei, which remain to be agreed between the two sides. Further progress is also needed on clarifying a number of ‘post-referendum' issues, in particular citizenship arrangements, delimitation of the border between North and South Sudan and agreement on sharing of oil revenues, to enable voters to make an informed choice when they go to the polls in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_3821">The three-member panel appointed by UN Secretary General Ban to monitor the referendum identified this and a number of other concerns following their visit to Sudan last month. The panel members called on the Government of Sudan and the Government of South Sudan to take all necessary steps to ensure the conditions necessary for the successful conduct of both referenda. They expressed the view that, should these efforts be made, it is still possible to hold both referenda according to the original timetable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3822">In view of the importance attached to a peaceful and orderly referendum process in Sudan, the international community has intensified its efforts to facilitate progress on the issue of the two referenda. Efforts are underway to prepare for a further round of talks in Ethiopia between the two parties which it is hoped will resume soon under the auspices of the African Union.  Preparations are also underway for a summit meeting on Sudan of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which comprises six countries in east Africa including Sudan, in Addis Ababa on 6 November. A meeting of the Consultative Forum on Sudan is also foreseen.</p>
            <p eId="para_3823">It is hoped that these initiatives will help the parties reach agreement on the necessary arrangements for the two referenda. The UN continues to play a lead role in coordinating international assistance to the Sudanese authorities through the UN mission in Sudan. The Security Council heard a report on the situation in Sudan on 25 October which reviewed the state of preparations for the two polls. The EU Special Representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, is playing an active role in encouraging both sides to fulfil their obligations under the CPA.  The EU will deploy an Election Observation Mission to Sudan, to cover both the voter registration process and the referendum and preparations for this mission have already begun.</p>
            <p eId="para_3824">Nationally, Ireland attaches considerable importance to a peaceful and orderly referendum process. This was one of the pressing issues I highlighted in my address to the UN General Assembly last month and personnel from our Embassy have also recently visited South Sudan to review the situation on the ground.  In September last, Ireland participated in a meeting with the Government of Southern Sudan hosted by the European Commission in Brussels.  The meeting offered an opportunity for the Government of Southern Sudan to outline its plan for capacity building and consolidation of governance during the remainder of the interim period of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which is due to conclude in July 2011, as well as its longer term vision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3825">The humanitarian situation in Sudan as a whole remains a matter of deep concern.  In particular, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan continues to be one of the worst in the world, where even basic needs often go unmet.  Ireland will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of South Sudan.  Ireland has provided over €35 million since 2008 for humanitarian and recovery projects across Sudan, including in Darfur and South Sudan.</p>

            <p eId="para_3827">Angola's first parliamentary election since 1992, and only the second since 1975, took place in September 2008.  The ruling MPLA party won a landslide majority in the 2008 general election, with 82% of votes and a total of 191 seats out of 220. This gave it a two-thirds majority in Parliament.  An EU election observation mission at the time said that they represented a ‘positive step towards strengthening democracy', despite some organisational weaknesses and state control of the media. While the EU mission welcomed the peaceful conduct of the elections it did not go as far as describing them as free and fair and made several recommendations in its final report, including strengthening the impartiality of the National Elections Commission (CNE).</p>
            <p eId="para_3828">The 2008 elections, though subject to these caveats, represented an important milestone for Angola on the route to democracy. Turnout was estimated at over 75%, which was a demonstration of the Angolan people's enthusiasm for the democratic process. That the elections passed off peacefully is significant given that the results of the only previous election in Angola in 1992 were violently disputed, leading to the re-intensification of the civil war. The next   round of Parliamentary elections is due to take place in 2012.  In relation to possible international assistance for these elections, the EU-Angola Country Strategy Paper for the period 2008-2013 allows for support to the Angolan electoral cycle, in areas of voter education and capacity-building to key institutions, including the National Electoral Commission.  EU assistance, including a possible electoral observation mission, is dependent on a request being made by the national authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3829">On a broader level, the promotion of democratic accountability and equality in order to ensure equitable and sustainable development is a policy priority of the Irish overseas aid programme.  Our work in this area includes participation in election monitoring and support; support for parliaments and parliamentary reform; support for strengthened public financial management systems and oversight bodies; and support for civil society, including independent media.  Irish Aid will continue to prioritise support to this important area and help to ensure effective, equitable and accountable governance in developing countries, particularly in Africa.</p>

          the steps he is taking to ensure that Ireland meets its 0.7% target of GNP in overseas aid by 2015; the timeline for delivering on this commitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_3831">Ireland has committed to the UN target to provide 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015.  The EU has committed to collectively attain the UN target by 2015, and has set an interim target of 0.51% for Ireland and other Member States in 2010.  This year the Government is providing a total of €671 million for ODA.  On current projections, this will amount to at least 0.52% of GNP, thereby exceeding the EU interim target.  Last year, Ireland was the seventh most generous aid donor in the world in per capita terms.  We are ahead of most other EU Member States in our progress towards the achievement of the international ODA target by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_3832">The economic crisis of the past two years has required very difficult decisions across all areas of public expenditure, including the allocations for ODA.  The sole motivation and objective of these decisions has been the need to restore stability to the public finances, in order to create the conditions for a resumption of economic growth.  Stable public finances and sustained growth in our own economy are the indispensable bases for the resumption of sustainable growth in the aid programme.  The Deputy will be fully aware of the extent of the challenge facing the Government in framing the Budget for 2011. The decision in relation to ODA, as with all budget expenditure decisions, will be taken in the light of the commitment by all parties to stabilising the public finances and restoring growth to the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3833">The Government's aid programme is the Irish people's aid programme.  We can be justifiably proud that it continues to receive strong international recognition for its quality and effectiveness and for its particular sharp focus on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  I am committed to maintaining the high quality of our aid programme, and its focus on the fight against global poverty and hunger.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3835">There are a number of different schemes operating in my Department which administer grant funding: the Irish Aid programme, Ireland's programme of official development assistance; the Emigrant Support Programme; the Reconciliation Fund for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation; the Anti-Sectarianism Fund; the Communicating Europe Initiative; the Cultural Programme; and the Asia Strategy.  In addition to this there are a number of grants which are given to specific projects, programmes or organisations such as the Atlantic Corridor Project; the Irish College in Paris; the Fulbright Commission; the European Movement Ireland, Title V of the Treaty on European Union Grants,and the Documents in Irish Foreign Policy Project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3836">Appropriate financial procedures and regulations are followed in relation to all funding provided by my Department, including, where appropriate, the requesting of certified or audited annual accounts and tax clearance certificates. Many of the schemes are aimed at civil society organisations, most of whom are not required to publish annual accounts.  In cases where the provision of the grant or subvention is on a statutory basis and requires the placement of the accounts in the library of the Oireachtas, this is done.</p>
            <p eId="para_3837">In some instances it has not been possible, in the time available, to provide the detail requested relating to funding in the year payments commenced. Details can be provided to the Deputy at a later stage if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3838">Irish Aid</p>
            <p eId="para_3839">The Government is providing a total of €671m for Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2010. Of this, €536m is administered by my Department, which manages the Government's development cooperation programme.  Under Vote 29 (International Cooperation), Irish Aid, which is based in the Development Cooperation Division of the Department, provides funding to a wide range of partners, including developing country partner governments, UN Agencies and other Multilateral and International Organisations, development Non-Governmental and Missionaries Organisations, and other civil society groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_3840">Funding is provided through various aid modalities and funding schemes managed by the aid programme. The clear focus of the programme, and funding allocation, is the alleviation of poverty, with a particular concentration on meeting fundamental needs, including food security, access to safe water, primary health care and access to basic education.  Approximately 95% of the overall funding allocated to Vote 29 in 2010 is managed through Grant or Grants in Aid funding schemes. The balance is allocated to meet the costs associated with the management, oversight and administration of the aid programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3841">The main funding schemes, together with overall allocations for 2010, are summarised as follows.</p>

            <p eId="para_3861">Following the 2002 report of the Task Force on policy regarding emigrants, the Government decided that the Department of Foreign Affairs would have lead responsibility for support services to emigrants and Irish communities abroad.  My Department's Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) provides grant funding to Irish community organisations abroad, and in particular to organisations which support vulnerable members of those communities. The Irish Abroad Unit, established in my Department in 2004, has responsibility for making recommendations on funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3862">In 2004, the first financial year for which my Department had lead responsibility for emigrant services grants, a total of €5,047,038 was provided to organisations giving assistance to Irish community groups abroad and those working with Irish emigrants. A list of these grants is included below.  To date in 2010 grants totalling €10,405,866 have been provided through the ESP. The table below summarises the regions and organisations to which the funds have been paid to date this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3863">All funding awarded under the ESP is approved for specific purposes, based on the applications received. The application process requires organisations to complete an on-line application form which includes the submission of their most recent accounting statements. In addition, organisations are required to submit by an agreed date a progress report, including financial details, on the project undertaken, and detailing how the project has contributed towards the achievement of the aims of the Emigrant Support Programme.</p>

The Reconciliation Fund was established in 1982 and the Anti Sectarianism Fund was launched in 2008. The purpose of these Funds is to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and efforts to create better understanding between people on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, and to assist local initiatives aimed at tackling sectarianism.  Up to €3 million has been allocated for both Funds in 2010. To date, €1.92 million has been awarded to 77 organisations, details of which are included below. A further round of funding will be announced shortly. All awards are published via press release on my Department's website (<i>www.dfa.ie</i>  ). The Funds receive applications from a variety of different organisations and successful applicants vary from year to year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3866">Each grant recipient must provide my Department with a written, detailed report of the project undertaken. All recipients of grant aid in excess of €12,500 must provide audited accounts on completion of the project. A Tax Clearance Certificate is required for grants in excess of €10,000. In addition to these procedures, officials from my Department regularly visit projects to assess suitably for funding.</p>

The Fulbright Commission supports study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States and the programme in Ireland was established in 1957. It was originally funded with £500,000, drawn from the original American Grant Counterpart Account of £6,000,000 given to Ireland, pursuant to the Economic Cooperation Agreement of 1948. In 2010, funding of €254,000 has been provided by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3869">The funding is used to support scholarships to Irish citizens to study and research in the United States and for US citizens to study and research in Ireland. In accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, a copy of the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the audited accounts of the Fulbright Commission are lodged annually with both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3870">The Centre Culturel Irlandais (Irish Cultural Centre) in the Irish College in Paris promotes cultural and educational exchange between France and Ireland. The college dates from the 16th century and, following a major refurbishment in 2001-2002 the Centre Culturel Irlandais was formally inaugurated in October 2002. A grant of €130,000 was provided by my Department in 2003 and the centre has received a grant of €150,000 in 2010. The funding is used to support the Centre's cultural programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3871">In 2010, a further €450,000 has been allocated to cultural initiatives undertaken by the Embassy and Consular network.

This figure also includes some support to Irish Studies at universities overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3872">Through Promoting Ireland Abroad Division,funding is also provided to the Atlantic Corridor project. The Atlantic Corridor was founded to facilitate, through its network of transatlantic and cross border activities and international linkages, the development of projects that will assist in supporting sustainable economic development and enhanced educational attainment.

            <p eId="para_3878">Title V of the Treaty on European Union Grants</p>
            <p eId="para_3879">Established in 2002, the purpose of this Subhead is to support actions consequent on Title V of the Treaty on the European Union. Title V established the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Expenditure under this Subhead has included mandatory contributions arising from our membership of the EU to the EU Satellite Centre and the EU Institute for Security Studies. Discretionary funding which promotes Ireland's CFSP priorities and the values which underpin Irish foreign policy is also disbursed from this Subhead. A list of grants made to date in 2010 under this funding scheme is included below. Funding for the recipients this year began between 2004 and 2009 and totals for the start year of funding for each organisation are given below. It should be noted that that not all of these organisations have received funding in each of the intervening years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3880">The reporting regime under this Subhead varies, according to the type of organisation being funded. Grants to international and regional organisations are always reflected in those organisations' annual accounts which are sent to my Department; other partner organisations provide appropriate reporting on expenditure and publicise the grant in official literature. In all cases, organisations are required to acknowledge receipt of funds and are monitored by my Department to ensure the grant is utilised appropriately and for the purposes outlined in the project proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3881">Documents in Irish Foreign Policy Project</p>
            <p eId="para_3882">The Documents in Irish Foreign Policy (DIFP) series is a multi-volume series of documents on Irish foreign policy which my Department undertakes in association with the Royal Irish Academy and the National Archives. The project was established in 1996, after being recommended in the 1996 White Paper on Foreign Policy. The 2010 allocation from my Department for the DIFP project is €175,000. The project operates under a Memorandum of Understanding which includes a provision that a copy of the audited accounts are provided to my Department in advance of payment being made. The accounts of the DIFP project, in common with all monies under the control of the RIA, are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
            <p eId="para_3883">Details of the aforementioned grants schemes are listed in the tables below.</p>

          if the EU proposes to hold an EU-Asia summit to enable the EU to position itself to take maximum advantage of the growing economies in Asia, including China, Singapore and India, and the investment and employment opportunities that these economies could bring to the EU and Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4353">The emergence of China and India as global economic powers in recent years makes Asia a key regional partner for the EU. Relations between the EU and Asia are organised on different levels. There are the region to region arrangements; there are relations between the EU and individual Asian countries; and there are the bilateral relations of EU Member States with individual countries.  Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is the main multilateral forum for high level regional dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and Asia.  It was established in 1996 and involves virtually the whole of Asia, including Brunei, Burma/Myanmar, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  This year,   Australia, New Zealand and Russia have been admitted to the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_4354">ASEM leaders meet at summits every two years. The 8th ASEM Summit was held in Brussels on 4-5 October. It brought together the leaders of 46 countries, together representing half of the world's GDP, almost 60% of the world's population and 60% of global trade. The summit highlighted the strong links between the EU and Asia and gave new momentum to the relationship. Leaders addressed a wide range of issues under four themes — global financial and economic governance; sustainable development; international cooperation on global and regional issues and the future of ASEM. A key outcome of ASEM 8 was the Brussels Declaration on More Effective Global Economic Governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4355">The Taoiseach attended the ASEM Summit where he had the opportunity to meet in the margins with a number of Heads of Government of participating countries, including the Chinese Premier.  He also participated in a breakfast meeting with the Asia Europe Business Forum, where leaders met senior business representatives from Asia and Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_4356">The EU is keenly aware of the necessity to take full advantage of annual summits with key partner countries in Asia to strongly promote its economic and trade agenda. This was a key issue highlighted at the September European Council meeting on external relations which approved a series of internal measures to improve the effectiveness of the EU's approach to its strategic partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4357">During 2010, the EU also held separate bilateral summits with Japan (April), China (October) and Korea (October), while a summit with India will take place in December.  At these high level meetings, the EU strongly promotes the trade and investment dimension of the relationship. During the summit with Korea, leaders signed the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which is the largest agreement of its type ever entered into by the EU. The EU is currently negotiating major partnership agreements with China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore, while there are also plans to seek new trade agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.</p>

            <p eId="para_4359">The Deputy will be aware, from my PQ reply to him of 21 October, that having been advised of the difficulties being experienced by Killester United Football Club members at immigration at São Paolo airport our Embassy immediately contacted the immigration authorities to ascertain why the group had been refused entry. Our Embassy was informed by the Brazilian authorities that the decision to refuse entry was based on an alleged incident involving two members of the group and two Brazilian citizens during the Iberia flight from Madrid to São Paulo.  It is understood that on landing in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian citizens lodged a formal complaint with the Military Police at the airport who are responsible for immigration control and that this complaint was verified by a number of other passengers on the flight. The Embassy was informed that the decision to refuse entry was based on this complaint and its subsequent verification by Brazilian authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4360">As I mentioned in my earlier reply to the Deputy the application of Brazilian law is a matter for the Brazilian authorities and it is not appropriate for the Department of Foreign Affairs to become directly involved in that process. However, our Embassy has again contacted the Brazilian Immigration Police authorities and were, I understand, informed that the citizens/ group involved could send complaint for the attention of the Federal Police Superintendent in the State where the refusal occurred. Our Embassy was also informed that the Superintendent in charge will consider any such complaint and decide whether or not to send it to the Delegate at Immigration in the airport who made the decision for refusal.  My Department will provide you with the contact details for the relevant Superintendent in São Paulo, as provided to them by the Brazilian authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4361">I also understand that our Embassy has been advised that any complaint should be laid out clearly, in as much detail as possible, and must be sent in Portuguese. If the group require any further information in this regard, they are welcome to contact the Consular Section of my Department.  I also understand that there is no agency similar to our Garda Ombudsman tasked with the consideration of complaints and/or any compensation which might arise following a refusal of entry and that it appears from our Embassy's contact with the Brazilian authorities that any form of compensation is extremely unlikely.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael Creed</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
          his views on ratification of the stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and if he will indicate the Government’s position regarding the level of Serbian co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_670">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4363">Negotiations on an EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) began in 2005.  However, the negotiation and signing process for the Agreement was delayed on a number of occasions until the EU was satisfied with Belgrade's level of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Cooperation with the ICTY is a precondition for those wishing to conclude Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU.  Following positive assessments by the ICTY Chief Prosecutor regarding Serbia's ongoing cooperation with the Tribunal, Ministers decided by consensus at the June Foreign Affairs Council to submit the EU-Serbia SAA to national parliaments for ratification.  At the same time, the Council again underlined that full cooperation with ICTY remains an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process.  The requirement for full cooperation with the ICTY is included in the text of the SAA with Serbia in Articles 2 and 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_4364">Each Member State ratifies Stabilisation and Association Agreements according to its own internal procedures.  In Ireland's case, this requires the passing of a Resolution by Dáil Éireann approving the terms of the Agreement.  It is proposed to submit a motion to Dáil Éireann in relation to the ratification by Ireland of the SAA with Serbia in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4365">As the Deputy may be aware, at the General Affairs Council on 25 October Ministers decided, again by consensus, to refer Serbia's December 2009 application for EU membership to the European Commission for its opinion.  This is essentially a technical step and usually happens quickly following the submission of an application.  The period for the formulation of that opinion has no specific timeframe, although the Commission's research on Serbia's application is likely to take several months and a report is not expected until the second half of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4366">The Council on 25 October also reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union and reiterated that each country's progress towards the Union depends on its individual efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process.  The Council underlined that a constructive approach towards regional cooperation is essential and called for progress in the process of EU-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.</p>
            <p eId="para_4367">Furthermore, the Council recalled that, in line with the political criteria of Copenhagen, full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is an essential condition for membership of the EU and that Serbia's full cooperation with the ICTY is already required by the EU-Serbia SAA (Articles 2 and 4).  The Council called upon Serbia to implement recommendations presented by the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor to the United Nations Security Council in June 2010 concerning Serbia's support in ongoing trials and appeals and assistance in the key matter of the arrest of the two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.  In addition, the Council underlined that, at each stage of Serbia's path towards EU accession, further steps will be taken only when the Council unanimously decides that full co-operation with the ICTY exists or continues to exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_4368">I share the widespread revulsion at the appalling massacres at Srebrenica and elsewhere during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I too want to see the perpetrators brought to justice as soon as possible.  Regrettably, as we know from experience elsewhere, including in this country, justice can sometimes take time to deliver.</p>
            <p eId="para_4369">Serbia must do all in its power to ensure that the two remaining indictees are immediately handed over to the ICTY.  However, I believe that we, for our part, should acknowledge the substantial progress Serbia has made in the ten years since public outrage led to the end of the Mílosevic regime.  Serbia today is a different place from the Serbia of Mílosevic because of the courageous decisions of governments in Belgrade since then.  Over the past year, in particular, we have seen a number of positive developments which demonstrate that Serbia's Government has moved away from the destructive politics of past decades.</p>
            <p eId="para_4370">These positive developments include:  the declaration by the Belgrade Parliament last March condemning the Srebrenica massacre; the appointment by Bosnia and Herzegovina in March of an Ambassador in Belgrade for the first time in three years; the handing over of the wartime notebooks of Ratko Mladic to the ICTY in May; the joint visit by the Serbian and Croatian Presidents to Bosnia for the Srebrenica commemoration this July; the indictment in September of nine former paramilitaries by the country's war crimes prosecutor over the killing of ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo conflict; and the joint EU-Serbia UN General Assembly resolution on Kosovo this September.</p>
            <p eId="para_4371">I met with Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic in New York last month.  He emphasised the importance Serbia attaches to EU integration and underlined Belgrade's commitment to working with the ICTY.  In response to my questioning, he assured me that his government is determined to secure the arrest of the two remaining indictees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4372">I believe that the most likely means of achieving the arrest of Mladic and Hadzic lies in a combination of encouragement and pressure designed to empower the progressive elements in Serbia and that it is important that we send a signal to the people of Serbia that we recognise the positive direction their country has taken in the past decade.  I welcome, therefore, the unanimous decision by Ministers to request an opinion on Serbia's membership application from the Commission.  We should continue to assist and encourage Serbia in its reform programme, as it rebuilds its relations with its neighbours and moves towards the EU.  At the same time, as with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process, the EU will insist at each stage in the process that Serbia cooperates fully with the ICTY.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael Creed</b>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4383">The Lisbon Strategy, launched by the European Council in March 2000, was an ambitious, multifaceted strategy which set the goal of Europe becoming "the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion and respect for the environment".  In an evaluation carried out earlier this year the Commission found that the main targets, covering employment rate and spend on R and D, had not been met, but in mitigation noted that the end of the term of the Lisbon Strategy came at a time when the impacts of the economic crisis were being deeply felt in Europe as in other parts of the world. On the plus side the Commission study states that the Strategy had a role in mobilising and assisting the reforms that Europe needs to become more competitive, and that benefits from it could be identified in the business environment and consumer choice areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4384">Ireland shares in much of that assessment.  Member States engaged thoroughly with the Strategy during its term. As envisioned in 2000, it was extremely broad in scope and aspiration, and implementation posed a variety of challenges, including in relation to its diffuse focus and its governance structures. In 2005, the European Council reviewed the Strategy and agreed to refocus its efforts on jobs and growth and establish a much more streamlined process for delivery, which resulted in improved outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4385">The December 2009 European Council noted that the Strategy had been useful in setting a framework for strengthening European competitiveness and encouraging structural reform, and drew the lesson from it that any new strategy would have to have a sharper focus and concentrate on a limited number of key objectives for achieving sustainable jobs and growth. Furthermore, the December 2009 European Council noted that "in view of the economic and social impact of the crisis, in view also of the challenges posed by ageing populations, increasing inequalities and climate change, a new approach is needed more than ever".</p>
            <p eId="para_4386">In response to the European Council's call, the European Commission conducted a public consultation process and in March 2010 presented a Communication entitled "Europe 2020: a strategy for smart sustainable and inclusive growth". The European Council, meeting in June 2010, finalised and launched a new European Strategy for Jobs and Growth, the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4387">Ireland welcomes the tighter focus adopted by the Europe 2020 Strategy and the improved and strengthened governance structures for the Strategy which have been put in place. Under the new Strategy, Heads of State and Government, meeting in the European Council, will have a hands-on leadership role in overseeing its implementation over the coming decade, as they have had in agreeing its overall goals and EU level targets during the first half of this year. The reinforcement through action at EU level of growth and reform polices we are pursuing nationally should be an important part of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">With regard to the roll out and implementation of the new Europe 2020 Strategy, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the details set out in my reply to his Written PQ (39308/10) of Wednesday, 27 October 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4390">As a beneficiary of past enlargement, and on the experience of more recent accessions, Ireland is broadly supportive of enlargement. The prospect of enlargement bolsters economic and political reform processes and helps to promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe. Ireland takes an active role in discussions on the issue, both at Council meetings and in bilateral discussions with existing and aspirant member states.   It is important to note that enlargement is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predetermined.</p>
            <p eId="para_4391">The Council plans to discuss enlargement again in detail at the European Council in December. Prior to this, the European Commission is due to publish their annual progress reports on candidate countries in November. These reports will provide a basis for further discussion and conclusions at the December Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_4392">Negotiations with Croatia   are well advanced and work on most chapters will be completed by the end of the year. Currently, 22 of the 35 negotiating chapters have been closed and the work of the Accession Treaty Drafting Group is well underway. A further 2-3 Chapters are expected to be closed at an Intergovernmental Conference for this purpose in November. Issues that still require effort concern measures to combat corruption and organised crime, and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The findings and recommendations of the Commission's 2010 annual Progress Report due to issue on 09 November will be very relevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4393">An intergovernmental conference with Iceland on 27 July marked the formal opening of negotiations and the negotiations are proceeding. The first step in this process is for the Commission to undertake a formal process of examination of the acquis with the Icelandic authorities, called screening. This allows it to be fully explained to Iceland, and to narrow down specific areas that will require substantial negotiation. Once the Commission gives its Screening Report to Council, negotiations begin across each chapter. This is expected to begin in early next year. Issues of contention are expected to be fisheries, agriculture, financial services and environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4394">In October 2009, the Commission recommended formally opening accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  The December Council welcomed progress made in a number of important areas but stopped short of endorsing the Commission's recommendation to open negotiations. The key obstacle is a bilateral dispute with Greece regarding the use of the name "Macedonia."  No breakthrough was reached at the June General Affairs Council and major progress is not expected over the next six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_4400">As I have stated previously, Ireland is committed to the full realisation of all human rights, and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, including the seventh Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation.  Last year, through the Government's development programme, Ireland provided €12.6 million in direct support to water and sanitation activities through our Programme Countries and civil society organisations. In addition, significant funding was provided to multilateral organisations, including UNICEF, which have a strong focus on water and sanitation in their programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4401">Ireland recognises the existence of human rights obligations relating to access to safe drinking water and sanitation and has supported initiatives at the UN Human Rights Council, most recently the Resolution on human rights and access to safe drinking water and sanitation, adopted at the 15th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2010 and co-sponsored by Ireland.  The topic is nonetheless a complex one, as illustrated by the negotiations on the draft Resolution on the human right to water and sanitation, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 28 July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4402">The differing views among EU member states were reflected in the fact that Ireland and seventeen of our EU partners (Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) took the decision to abstain from voting on that Resolution; nine EU member states voted in favour of the Resolution (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain).  This division reflects the ongoing debate in the European Union on this issue.  Ireland did not wish to prejudice eventual EU consensus on this issue and took the decision to abstain from the vote on the General Assembly Resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_4403">Clarification of the content of human rights obligations relating to access to safe drinking water and sanitation will require further discussion at the UN, as well as among relevant Government Departments.  In this regard, Ireland supports the work of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Ms. Catarina de Albuquerque, whose work is mandated by the Human Rights Council.  In light of the adoption of the General Assembly Resolution in July 2010 and the Human Rights Council Resolution in September 2010, my Department, including Irish Aid, intends to engage in discussions with other relevant Departments including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Our deliberations and discussions on these important matters will continue to be informed by the forthcoming reports of the Independent Expert, including her annual reports to the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_4409">No significant printing contracts have been awarded by my Department to operators from outside the State in the past three years. My Department's missions abroad have occasional small print requirements and it is more economically advantageous to source such requirements by getting competitive quotes from local providers. In the case of smaller print jobs at Headquarters my Department has made use of drawdown contracts put in place by the National Procurement Service (formerly the Government Supplies Agency) and it is also intended to make use of the panel of print service providers which has recently been established by the National Procurement Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4410">My Department's largest print requirements are for passport application forms and passport booklets.  Both of these contracts are currently held by Irish companies with all technical and production facilities located in Ireland.  In accordance with Irish law (which gives effect to Ireland's international obligations in these matters), these contracts are tendered periodically and are open to competition from suppliers in all European Union and European Economic Area (EEA) countries as well as suppliers from countries that are parties to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).</p>
            <p eId="para_4411">I appreciate that this is a competitive challenge to Irish companies. However, under the same arrangements, there is an equivalent entitlement for Irish companies to compete for a vast range of public sector contracts in all EU and EEA countries as well as in all GPA countries. Access to such opportunities is vital to our exporting economy and to our prospects for economic growth. Details on how to access opportunities in international public sector markets can be found on my Department's website and on the Enterprise Ireland website. The Deputy can be assured that both Enterprise Ireland and my Department, including at embassies abroad, will be happy to provide any assistance they can to Irish companies in pursuing public procurement opportunities overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_4413">My Department is involved in the operation of two high level groups — the Consultative Group on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs/NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights.   My Department has chaired the Consultative Group on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. The Group was established to assist with the development of Ireland's National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325. It first met in February 2010 and has met on five subsequent occasions to date. Civil society representatives, academics, and representatives of other relevant government departments, including the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, and Defence are represented on the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_4414">It has been agreed to extend the consultation process on UNSCR1325 until the end of 2010, and an independent Chair has recently been appointed to lead this process. My Department continues to be a member of the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_4415">The Joint Department of Foreign Affairs/NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights is chaired by an official of my Department. Established in 1997, the purpose of the Committee is to provide a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between my Department and representatives of the NGO Community. It is comprised of representatives of human rights NGOs and experts, who serve in a voluntary capacity, as well as officers of my Department.  The Standing Committee meets approximately four times per year, with provision for additional meetings in exceptional circumstances. A new Standing Committee was appointed earlier this year, with a term of office of two years, effective from 1 October 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4473">I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 to 362, inclusive, and 366 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4474">There are currently 96,500 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 62% since the end of December 2007. The outturn for rent supplement for 2009 was €511m with €509m provided for in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4475">It is not possible to provide an accurate cost to the exchequer if the withdrawal rates for rent and mortgage interest supplements were adjusted due to the many variables in determining a person's entitlement.  Some of factors which affect the amount of rent or mortgage interest supplement payable include:</p>
            <p eId="para_4476">The accommodation cost,</p>
            <p eId="para_4477">The household composition,</p>
            <p eId="para_4478">Any special needs or circumstances the applicant may have or require,</p>
            <p eId="para_4479">The applicant's earnings and its impact on the rate of primary scheme payable (e.g. jobseeker's allowance/benefit, one parent family payment),</p>
            <p eId="para_4480">The different types of incomes that an applicant may have, for example maintenance payment or income from investments,</p>
            <p eId="para_4481">The location of the accommodation, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4482">The number of hours per week worked; the supplements are not payable where a member of the household works for 30 or more hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4483">The current assessment of means for these schemes provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive a rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income is disregarded with 75% of any additional income above €75 being contributed toward the accommodation cost. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4484">The tabular statement below shows the impact of adjusting the withdrawal rate for a person with an income of €250 per week in excess of the SWA appropriate to their circumstances. This statement shows that as the withdrawal rate reduces the amount of supplement payable increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4485">Overall, I am satisfied that the rent and mortgage interest supplement schemes provide for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours worked and earning increase and have no plans at present to change these arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_4536">In considering any changes to social welfare schemes, full consideration is given to the impact of any proposals on the recipients involved.  The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.  Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.</p>
            <p eId="para_4537">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.   Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_4538">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.   These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4539">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4540">As regards the suggestion to increase the number of hours a carer can engage in employment from 15 to 19 hours per week, the fundamental qualifying condition for carer's allowance, carers' benefit and the respite care grant is that the carer must be providing "full time care and attention" to a person who needs it.   Prior to June 2006 people could engage in employment outside the home for up to 10 hours per week and still qualify for payment.  Since then, the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home has increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  This relaxation was introduced to recognise the value of work for the carer in terms of additional income, self-esteem, a form of respite and retention of involvement in the workforce. This improvement applies to carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  Similarly, a person on carer's leave can also engage in employment, education or training outside the home for up to 15 hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4541">It is important, however, to protect the needs of the care recipient.  The qualifying conditions for the payment are such that the person receiving care is medially assessed as needing it on a full-time basis.  Any further change would necessarily dilute the very notion of "full time care and attention" and directly impact on the person who needs that care.  The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_4547">As regards the issue of access to the warmer home scheme, this scheme is operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) which is under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In carrying out its function the SEAI has decided to prioritise those in receipt of the fuel allowance.  While carers are not in receipt of the fuel allowance, they do receive the household benefits package and free travel which represents a significant additional level of support.  In the case of this submission, the care recipient is in receipt of fuel allowance and could, therefore, apply for the warmer home scheme.  The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_4551">My Department is currently renting two premises — Office Suites 1-3, Bridgewater Business Centre, Islandbridge, Dublin 8; and the Community Social Services Centre Bishopsgate, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath.  The Community Social Services Centre, Mullingar is the operational location for the Department's Disability Activation Project which is funded by the European Social Fund.  This building is currently in use.</p>
            <p eId="para_4552">The Bridgewater Business Centre was originally leased by the Combat Poverty Agency in April 1996 for a period of 21 years. From 1 July 2009, the Combat Poverty Agency integrated with the former Office for Social Inclusion within my Department, to form the new Social Inclusion Division, which subsequently transferred to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs on 1 May 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4553">The Department has exercised an option to break out of the 21-year lease by March 2011, and is currently in the process of applying the necessary measures in order to return possession of the property. Staff were relocated from Bridgewater Business Centre in October 2009. The maintenance and security costs for 2010 to date are €14,631.  The premises costs, including rent, rates, insurance, maintenance, etc for 2008 and 2009, in respect of the above buildings are set out in the table below.</p>

            <p eId="para_4573">The Department operates an ‘open sourcing' procurement model which aims to achieve the most economically advantageous result for each requirement/procurement. This includes consideration of open source solutions and generic consumables.</p>
            <p eId="para_4574">Open source software and proprietary software have different business models and it is difficult to compare them directly even where they have directly comparable functionality.  The open source business model depends on service and support revenues whereas the proprietary software business model depends on a mixture of licence fees and support revenues. Neither is intrinsically better than the other — the Department's experience is that lower initial acquisition costs for open source are usually balanced by overall higher support costs, particularly where a diverse set of packages are deployed.  The Department has a number of open source packages in use as well as a number of proprietary software packages.</p>

            <p eId="para_4576">The person concerned last renewed their family income supplement (FIS) claim in December 2009.  To qualify for FIS a person must have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. A qualified child is any child under 18 or aged 18 to 22 if in full-time education. At the time of renewal the person concerned had one qualified child in full time education and accordingly was awarded FIS. Subsequently the qualified child ceased full time education and payment of FIS was stopped.</p>
            <p eId="para_4577">However, current legislation provides that once FIS is awarded, it continues to be payable at the rate awarded for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment. The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks but there is no provision for a reduction in rate where the child ceases to be qualified during this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4578">Consequently the person concerned remains entitled to a FIS payment until December 2010.  Payment of FIS will now be re-instated to the person concerned and continued until December 2010. Arrears due since payment of FIS was stopped on 20th of October, totalling €260, will issue with the weekly payment due for 4th of November.  The person concerned will be notified accordingly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4585">During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.   However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.   In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.   This position remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_4586">The Government acknowledges and recognises the vital contribution that carers make to the economy and society.   It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.  Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.   The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.</p>
            <p eId="para_4587">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.    Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively.  As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_4588">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4589">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.   The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_5241">Where, in the future, eligibility for one-parent family payment ceases due to the youngest child attaining the age of 14, a range of other income supports will be available, subject to  satisfying the various conditions of the particular scheme. These schemes include family income supplement, jobseeker's allowance, farm assist, disability allowance and blind pension.  It is not possible to accurately predict which of these schemes will prove to be the most beneficial option for any individual affected by the change in One-Parent Family Payment eligibility, as that will depend on their particular circumstances at that time, such as the number of hours work they secure, the level of earnings and so on. Consequently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of applying a special earnings disregard in the jobseeker's allowance scheme for single parents with the youngest qualified child aged 14 or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_5242">It is important to note that the 6-year tapered phasing out period will remain as part of the provisions for existing recipients with the new age of 14 cut-off point coming in to effect for them in 2016, i.e. entitlement to the payment being maintained at 18 years for 2011 and 2012 and then reducing on a yearly basis from 17 years in 2013 to 16 years in 2014, 15 years in 2015 and then to 14 years in 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_5244">To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  There are currently some 27,228  people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment of which 5,606  are also in receipt of a One Parent Family Payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5245">With regard to the level of take up, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements.  Accordingly the department completed a research project in 2008 to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  This research project included a survey of over 3,000 families which appeared to satisfy conditions for receipt of FIS.  From over 1,000 valid responses received the survey identified that only 23% might actually be eligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5246">The research also found that overall awareness of Family Income Supplement among potential recipients is high with nearly three in four claiming to have heard of the scheme.  Despite high levels of awareness, there was a lack of awareness and understanding of the eligibility requirements with only one in three claiming to be aware of the qualifying criteria for FIS.  The report recommends that the Department needs to ensure that information about the scheme is advertised in a focused way with the eligibility and qualification criteria communicated as clearly as possible.  The Department is addressing this by ensuring such information is highlighted as part of its ongoing information strategy.</p>

These conditions vary from scheme to scheme. In the case of One-Parent Family Payment, this would include confirmation of a person's place of habitual residence and, where appropriate, to assess means. In some cases, there is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary enquiries to enable decisions to be made. Time can also elapse where the applicants do not supply all the necessary information in support of their claim. Increases in the number of claims can also impact on processing times. Operational procedures, the organisation of work, and the allocation of staff resources continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the processing capability and to improve these times.</p>

            <p eId="para_5250">The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support services that are designed to encourage and to support social welfare recipients of working age, including lone parents, to reduce their dependency on social welfare payments and to return to work.  These services are provided through the Department's network of locally-based Facilitators.</p>
            <p eId="para_5251">The primary role of these Facilitators is to work with social welfare recipients to help them to identify appropriate training or development programmes that will enhance their skills and ultimately improve their employment chances as well as help them to continue to develop on a personal level.  They work in close    co-operation with other agencies and service providers including FÁS, VECS, other education and training providers and the local community and voluntary sector.  In addition, they provide advice and support to customers who wish to access the Back-to-Education Allowance Scheme and the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance Scheme that are run by this Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5252">Currently, all lone parents who present themselves to FÁS Employment Services are already provided with a one-to-one guidance interview with an Employment Services Officer.  As part of this process, lone parents are advised on suitable labour market opportunities such as current work vacancies and suitable training/employment programme places, and may also be referred to other FÁS supports.  A new support model to help people to overcome barriers and to increase their opportunity to access training and employment programmes and, ultimately, the open labour market, is being tested by FÁS with lone parents.  This ‘Steps to Employment' Programme is aimed at individuals who are parenting alone who want to get a job or improve their work prospects and who need to learn new skills through training or a return to education in order to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_5253">This Department also operates the Back-to-Education Allowance (BTEA) Scheme.  Since its introduction, the primary objective of this Scheme is to help those who are in receipt of a social welfare payment to improve their employability and job-readiness by acquiring additional   educational qualifications.  It is a second-chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third-level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  A total of 3,220 lone parents availed of the Scheme in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5254">Under recently announced changes in ministerial responsibility, the Community Services Programme and the Rural Social Scheme have been transferred to this Department from the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Work is also underway to finalise the transfer of both the Employment Services and the Community Services divisions of FÁS to this Department.  Overall, the transfer of functions that is being implemented will facilitate the delivery of a more streamlined and effective response to the needs of people of working  age, including lone parents, to assist them, where appropriate, to access relevant education, skill development and related supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_5287">There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight  months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.  In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order.

            <p eId="para_5296">Activation and support for those who are unemployed is a key priority for Government.  Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced a number of changes to improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas.  These changes include the restructuring of Departmental responsibilities with the objective of providing a stream-lined response to the income support and job search needs of people who are unemployed.  When all functions have been transferred, the employment and community services programmes of FÁS, the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programmes, previously delivered by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, will be managed by a single Department with the objective of providing a more effective and streamlined service to the unemployed people by integrating the income support provided through the social welfare system with supports for activation and re-entry to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5297">In this context, my Department is devising proposals for the development of new initiatives based on the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programme which will offer social employment opportunities.  Considerable work is required on these proposals before they come on stream and take their place within the suite of activation measures aimed at supporting unemployed people.  The issues raised in the correspondence referred to by the Deputy in respect of the displacement of current employment and training opportunities on Community Employment, concerns about the ability and capacity of the community and voluntary sector to provide work opportunities and the needs for task specific training are being considered in the implementation of these initiatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_5472">I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 and 394 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5473">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st May 2004.  A person who does not satisfy the habitual residence condition is not eligible for specified social welfare payments, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.  The purpose of the habitual residence condition is to safeguard the social welfare system from abuse by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5474">I am not aware of any country that makes its assistance schemes freely available to all persons without some condition as to nationality or residence.  Determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.    The factors set out in this legislation have been derived from European Court of Justice case law which examined the concept of habitual residence in the context of social welfare benefits.  That case law also confirms that including a habitual residence condition for social assistance payments where persons have had little or no link to the employment market is not in conflict with the freedom of movement rights within the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_5475">The habitual residence condition does not apply to exceptional needs or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  These payments may therefore be used to meet the immediate needs of any person who is in need, but they cannot be availed of on a continuing basis in a way that undermines the purpose of the habitual residence condition.  These payments can however be extended to facilitate voluntary return of an EU citizen to their home State if they so wish.  In the case of asylum seekers or illegal migrants, voluntary repatriation may be arranged through the International Organisation for Migration funded by the Department of Justice and Law Reform, and the community welfare service will assist in meeting the interim needs while that is being arranged.</p>

            <p eId="para_5478">I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 396 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5479">The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  With effect from 19th July 2010, changes have been made to the qualifying conditions of the back to education scheme to reflect the present economic situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5480">The period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing BTEA was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_5481">In addition, a person can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.  This also applies to people who are granted an exemption from a period of their third level course. A person who completed earlier year(s) of his/her third level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker's payment, may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5482">These enhancements build on other improvements made to the scheme in recent years in response to the changing economic climate: from September 2007, the qualifying period for illness benefit was reduced from 3 years to 2 years; from September 2008, the cost of education allowance, which is an additional annual payment made to cover the cost of books and materials, was increased from €400 to €500; from September 2009, the 6 month waiting period for those pursuing second level courses was reduced to 3 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_5483">The number of participants on the Back to Education Scheme in the 2009/2010 academic year was 20,808 which represented a 79% increase on the previous year. The number of participants in the 2008/2009 academic year also represented an increase of 31% on the previous academic year. As of 22nd October in the region of 21,500 participants were approved the Back to Education Allowance. Due to the nature of the scheme a significant number of applications are processed in October and indications are that BTEA numbers will increase noticeably again for this academic year. (Table 1 below details number of participants in the previous 3 academic years).</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_5494">The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5495">The Department plays a key role in the National Employment Action Plan which is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.  Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register, are identified by this Department and referred to FÁS for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  In addition, under a new initiative, unemployed people are being referred to group engagement sessions in a number of areas.  This is aimed at increasing the capacity, effectiveness and efficiency of the process. This will be supported in due course by the roll-out of the Department's profiling and care management systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_5496">The Department also offers one-to-one assistance through its facilitation service which operates at a local level nationwide in conjunction with FÁS and other agencies.   Facilitators help jobseekers develop individual progression plans to enhance their skills and ultimately improve their employment chances.  The back to education allowance which supports people who are furthest from the labour market and back to work initiatives are also available and provide targeted supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_5497">The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</p>
            <p eId="para_5498">The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments to make a return to work financially attractive and viable. Participants are allowed retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment (100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2) and may retain secondary benefits over two years.  The short term enterprise allowance (STEA) is payable to a person who qualifies for jobseekers' benefit and who wishes to commence in self employment. This allowance is payable for the duration of their jobseeker's benefit entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5499">A part-time job incentive scheme is also available which allows persons who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a weekly income supplement called the part-time job allowance.  In addition, an Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme was launched on 20th June 2010.  Subject to compliance with the rules of the scheme, an employer taking on an additional employee in 2010 who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, will be exempted from liability for employers' PRSI for 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_5500">Under recently announced changes in ministerial responsibility, the rural social scheme and community services programmes have transferred to this Department from the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Work is also underway to finalise the transfer of both the Employment and Community Services divisions of FÁS to this Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5501">Overall, this re-structuring of departmental and agency responsibilities will facilitate the delivery of a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed.  Bringing together, under the aegis of one department, the employment services of FÁS, the expertise of its placement officers and the unemployment services of this Department as well as the community employment schemes, job initiative scheme, community services programme and the rural social scheme will offer significant opportunities to generate synergies, improve efficiency and, ultimately, improve service delivery to those availing of those services.</p>

            <p eId="para_5505">Since May 2008, some 450 additional posts have been assigned to my Department to deal with the significant increase in claims for the schemes operated by the Department. The majority of these posts have been sourced through the lateral transfer and redeployment of staff from within the Department and from other Government Departments.  Staffing needs are kept under constant review to ensure that best use is made of all available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_5506">It is also recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself is not the only appropriate way to deal with the rising claim load.  Since early 2008 all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims has been examined and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls.  In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending the office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_5507">In addition, a range of other process improvements have been introduced which include:</p>
            <p eId="para_5508">A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires;</p>
            <p eId="para_5509">A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years;</p>
            <p eId="para_5510">Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times;</p>
            <p eId="para_5511">More straightforward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced;</p>
            <p eId="para_5512">The Department has also simplified processing methods for some customers who work casually, part-time or on systematic short-time work.</p>

            <p eId="para_5515">In addition to statutory schemes a number of non-statutory schemes are operated by my Department. Decisions are made by Officers of my Department based on published guidelines (available on my Department's website www.welfare.ie)   setting out the conditions of entitlement.  The back to education scheme is a non-statutory stand alone scheme.  Such decisions cannot be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  However, the claimant may seek a full and fresh review of the case by an officer in my Department at a higher level if s/he is dissatisfied with the decision made enclosing any new evidence in support of the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_5516">Applicants for the back to education scheme are already in receipt of another social welfare payment before a decision is made on their entitlement.

        <b>Deputy Róisín Shortall</b>
         asked the

          his plans to reform rent supplement to enable the payment to be made directly to the landlord instead of the tenant.
        [39267/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_722">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_5527">The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long term housing support or a permanent solution to a person's housing needs. Rent supplement has successfully responded to the dramatic increased demand for income support to support accommodation costs. There are currently 96,500 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 62% since the end of December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5528">Current legislation already provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the HSE. Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. To remove the right of the tenant to receive this payment by making it payable only to the landlord would require legislative amendment and I have no plans at present to make this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_5529">Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords still have to collect the tenant contribution towards their rent (a minimum of €104 per month). The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant's income; in some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while for others the tenant makes an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances. For example, where a person is in part-time income and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly whilst still having to collect the 90% from the tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5530">The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if this arrangement were to be changed for example CWO's would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 96,500 additional clients, the landlords. This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties. In particular, it would also result in CWOs being drawn into disputes between both landlords and tenants.  There may also be financial and control implications in cases where a tenant moves address and neither the landlord nor tenant inform the Department. Similarly, where a tenant is no longer eligible for rent supplement and the Department ceases paying the landlord, the Department may find itself involved in eviction proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5531">Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process. It is also open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement for the purpose for which it was intended the matter investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_5532">Since 2004 local authorities have specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Local authorities are now meeting the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). In such cases the local authority has a direct contractual relationship with the landlord in RAS tenancies and as part of that contract the local authority pays rent directly to the landlord.</p>

            <p eId="para_5562">My Department took part in the Inter-Departmental Group on Administrative Burden Reduction, as led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  As a consequence of this participation, my Department identified all legislation that imposes an administrative burden on business, listed the so-called information obligations (IOs) in each such piece of legislation and estimated in broad terms the burden that each IO imposes on business, according to the number of businesses affected, the frequency of obligation and the administrative time required to comply with the IO.  The outcome of this work resulted in the identification of ten IOs, with all ten recording a ‘low' burden affecting comparatively small populations of businesses with, at most, a frequency of once-per-annum completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5563">In view of the comparatively minor nature of the administrative burdens identified, it was agreed at both Ministerial and Departmental level between my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation that the identified IOs do not warrant detailed measurement and the preparation of simplification plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_5564">This agreement arose from the observation that international evidence suggests that approximately 90 per cent of administrative costs is caused by approximately 5 per cent of regulation.  Accordingly, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is taking the approach that it would be wasteful of resources to engage in a complex and costly process of detailed burden measurement and reduction for all Irish regulation.  Instead, the core principle of that Department's methodology is that it is seeking to identify the 5 per cent of regulation that is most burdensome and to subject only that 5 per cent to detailed burden measurement and simplification.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5580">I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 to 423, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5581">The European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 prescribe the quality standards to be applied in relation to supplies of drinking water, including requirements relating to sampling and analysis of water to ensure that it meets those standards. The Regulations prescribe a maximum parametric value of 25 micrograms of lead per litre of drinking water supplied.</p>
            <p eId="para_5582">The Regulations designate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the supervisory authority for local authority drinking water supplies.  In April 2009, the EPA issued guidance to local authorities on dealing with lead in drinking water supplies.  This guidance addresses the need to identify lead distribution mains, service connections in the ownership of the local authority, lead plumbing in public buildings, the extent of lead plumbing in domestic dwellings and subsequently the approach to be taken where lead pipes have been identified.  Local authorities have been advised by my Department that funding is available to carry out appropriate work to replace lead in the distribution mains.</p>
            <p eId="para_5583">Local authorities are responsible for the drinking water mains and communication pipes linking the mains to stopcocks on individual properties or to the boundary of private property.  Section 43(3) and Section 54(1) of the Water Services Act 2007 state that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system and is required to ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards.  Therefore, responsibility for lead piping is dependent on whether it is part of the local authority's distribution system i.e. normally before the service connection to the house, or part of the internal distribution system, i.e. within the boundary of the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_5584">The 2007 Regulations require that where a supply of water is considered to be a risk to human health, the local authority which is responsible for that supply must consult with the Health Service Executive (HSE) to agree appropriate follow-up action. The HSE has issued guidance (which is available on the HSE website — www.hse.ie) regarding lead in drinking water, and advises that where there is any lead pipe work between the stop valve outside the house and the kitchen tap, the best solution is to replace it with plastic pipe work. However, the HSE advises householders with lead pipes not to drink water that has been standing in the pipes for long periods, overnight, or if no one has been in the house for more than six hours. In such circumstances, the HSE advises that householders should draw off a small quantity of water from the kitchen cold tap to clear the water which has been standing in the pipes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5585">My Department has consulted with the local authority in question. The authority is aware of the matter and has concluded that the lead levels in the water are caused by lead plumbing in the premises. The authority has given the persons concerned the advice from the HSE.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5593">The EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) required each Member State to introduce regulations providing for a producer funded take-back scheme for consumers of end-of-life equipment from 13 August 2005.  To come within the scope of the WEEE Directive, items of electrical and electronic equipment must be:</p>
            <p eId="para_5594">dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly; and</p>
            <p eId="para_5595">designed for use with a voltage rating not exceeding 1,000 volts for alternating current (AC) and 1,500 volts for direct current (DC).</p>
            <p eId="para_5596">Electronic cigarettes which are placed on the market come within the scope of the WEEE Directive.  Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of waste electrical and electronic equipment is solely a producer responsibility. Two collective compliance schemes, functioning under the responsibility of producers, are operating in Ireland.  These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for ensuring that all recovered household WEEE is managed in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5597">The compliance schemes are also responsible for the procurement of the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of all household WEEE deposited at designated collection points. These include civic amenity facilities and retail outlets. The compliance schemes report that circa 9kg per capita of household WEEE is being collected for recycling per annum; this is over double the prescribed 4kg target as set out in the WEEE Directive and indicates that Ireland has had significant success in implementing this Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5598">Retailers are required by law to take back WEEE free of charge on a one-for-one, like-for-like, basis from householders. Where a replacement product is bought over the counter, retailers must take back the old product in-store, either at the time of sale or within a maximum of 15 days of the date of sale. Where a replacement product is delivered, retailers must take back the old product, if ready for immediate collection, on completion of the delivery or within a maximum of 30 days of the date of delivery. Each local authority must also accept household WEEE free of charge at its civic amenity facilities.  Retailers can have their premises designated as ‘WEEE collection points' or deposit household WEEE free of charge at local authority civic amenity facilities. There are currently in excess of 600 ‘WEEE collection points' including both retail outlets and civic amenity facilities. Retailers are obliged to notify purchasers of these take back arrangements. Information on the WEEE take back system is available on my Department's web site — www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5599">The WEEE Monitoring Group, which is made up of representatives from relevant industry and public sector stakeholders, oversees the implementation and operation of the WEEE Directive in Ireland. Responsibility for enforcement rests with the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities. My Department continues to work with relevant stakeholders through this Group to ensure that Ireland continues its strong track record of performance versus our EU targets for WEEE recovery and recycling.</p>

            <p eId="para_5603">Under Section 15 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, it is a duty of every local authority to establish and maintain one or more shelters for dogs seized, accepted or detained under any of the provisions of the Act.  The local authority may enter into arrangements with any person for the provision and maintenance of such shelters and for the exercise by such person of the functions of the local authority under the Act in respect of the acceptance, detention, disposal and destruction of stray and unwanted dogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5604">The Dog Breeding Establishments Act was signed by the President on 21 July, 2010 following its passage through the Oireachtas. It is intended that the Act will commence in early 2011.  The dog control function of local authorities is funded in part through income raised from the issuing of dog licences. The forthcoming increase in this licence fee, as provided in the Act, should provide extra funding for local authorities which will be of assistance to them in carrying out their dog control functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5605">Under the new Act, a State regulated registration system for dog breeding establishments will be put in place and guidelines will be published in relation to the operation of dog breeding establishments. In this regard, draft guidelines will be published shortly for public consultation.  The new measures will be enforced through the existing local authority dog control structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5606">Section 16 of the Act provides that it will be unlawful for the operator of a dog breeding establishment to keep a dog that is over 12 weeks old which is not implanted with a microchip. The time limit for microchipping will reduce to 8 weeks after the first year of operation of the Act. This provision will assist Local Authorities in identifying dogs as part of their control functions.  A number of the issues raised in the correspondence referred to in the Question are matters for my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</p>

         the settlement agreed by Mayo County Council on the 7 July 2010 allowing a continuance of operations for an unauthorised quarry development on a limestone pavement, adjacent to a ecologically valuable, historical, semi-natural woodland, which has previously been refused planning permission by Mayo County Council and An Bord Pleanála does the Minister intend a planning review of Mayo County Council’s planning practices.

            <p eId="para_5663">I propose to take Questions Nos. 437 to 441, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5664">Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  The 2000 Planning Act places substantial obligations on planning authorities in relation to enforcement.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority's decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5665">It might also be noted that the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 contains a number of further provisions in relation to enforcement.  The minimum fines have been increased and the requirements on a planning authority in relation to the issuing of an enforcement notice have also been increased: it is now explicitly provided that where unauthorised development is being carried out and the developer has not moved to rectify the position, the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice unless there is a compelling reason for not doing so.  Also, the so-called 7 year rule, under which proceedings may not be taken, in the case of a development with no permission, after 7 years from the commencement of the development, has been abolished in the case of quarries and peat extraction activities.  Two of these provisions have been commenced and it is intended to commence the last one shortly.  Under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_5667">Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  However, I have urged local authorities to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard. Across the 88 local authorities the average change of ARV from 2009 to 2010 shows a decrease of 0.62%. As part of a range of measures to aid economic recovery, I am clear on the need for continued reductions in commercial rates over the coming years.</p>

My Department has examined its primary and secondary legislation since 2001 and has identified 209 information obligations stemming from 51 pieces of legislation<b/>for which the Department is responsible.  Of these 209 information obligations, the 20 obligations which appear to create the greatest burden have been identified. </p>
            <p eId="para_5739">To ensure consistency in the measurement of the actual costs to business stemming from information obligations across all Departments and Agencies concerned, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is arranging to conduct the cost measurement process on the basis of a methodology used throughout EU Member States.  I understand that this process will be completed in 2011, at which stage the actual costs to business will be identified.  Following measurement, my Department will prepare a simplification plan, which will target any unnecessary information obligations, streamline systems and remove any duplication of requirements on business as far as possible in order to contribute towards achieving the 25% reduction in costs to business by 2012.</p>

For the Deputy's information, construction of the Corrib Gas Terminal at Bellanaboy is substantially completed as are the subsea facilities at the Corrib Gas Field.  Last summer the 83km offshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline was installed.  The developers are engaged in the process of securing a number of statutory consents required for the construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline.  Completion of the development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.</p>

            <p eId="para_5745">The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty and is targeted at householders who are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, Disability Benefit or Invalidity Benefit.  Measures undertaken include attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, cavity wall insulation and energy advice at no cost to eligible households.  The scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department, and is delivered through a combination of community based organisations (CBOs) and a panel of private contractors.  Vulnerable homes are primarily identified by the SEAI and the CBOs, who work in partnership with local networks of community support and poverty organisations, which include public health nurses, MABS and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.  Since the inception of the WHS in 2000, almost 62,000 low income homes have been upgraded with energy efficiency measures.  The 2010 Allocation for the WHS is €29.81 million, and it is expected that 22,500 homes will be assisted under the scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5746">The SEAI has worked closely with the Department of Social Protection to identify vulnerable homes, and has conducted a mail shot directed at 46,000 homes in receipt of Fuel Allowance in areas not covered by the CBOs.  The mail shot was dispatched in July 2010, and comprised information on the scheme and the application process.  Some 13,300 applications have been received to date, and it is estimated that approximately 15,000 eligible homes will be identified through this process.  In addition to this mail shot, the updated Keep Well and Warm booklet, and the associated website, provide energy saving advice as well as information on grant schemes and other supports.  Some 140,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed across the country to date, and further distribution will take place in the course of the winter months.</p>

Purchases are made solely on the lowest price for a suitable product at any given time; brand is not a factor in product purchase.  The volume of generic or branded consumables purchased is not recorded.  An open source product is used within the Information Systems Division for monitoring the availability of networks and servers.  An equivalent proprietary solution would cost approximately €10,000.  My Department's overall approach is geared to using, and promoting the use of open source software where this is appropriate and cost effective.  The open source community would generally agree that the general use of open source software in a corporate environment is only now becoming a realistic proposition.  While the initial costs of open source software are very low, it does require a larger technical effort to support going forward with resultant cost implications.</p>

            <p eId="para_5816">The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at <i> www.callcosts.ie.</i>  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_5817">In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and which seek a service.  I am pleased to say that under the NBS broadband is now available in all Electoral Divisions in the NBS Coverage Area.  It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_5818">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5819">While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral — it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>

            <p eId="para_5825">In May of this year, I announced a Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) Scheme for electricity generated from biomass including energy crops such as miscanthus and willow, ranging from 8.5 cent per kilowatt hour to 15 cent per kilowatt hour depending on the technology deployed.  State Aid Clearance from the European Commission is required before the new feed in tariffs can be implemented.  My Department is currently finalising the State Aid submission together with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and this will be forwarded to the Commission for discussion with Commission Services this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5826">My Department estimates that it will take two to three months for clearance to be finalised and approved by the European Commission.  Therefore, I expect that I will be in a position to announce implementation of the tariffs in the first quarter of 2011.  The announcement of the proposed REFIT Scheme has of itself been a positive development for the biomass sector, together with the support for energy crops provided by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and ongoing development of the demand side including the co-firing of biomass at Bord na Móna's peat generation plant at Edenderry</p>

            <p eId="para_5846">Open cycle gas generation is extremely valuable in the Irish generation context, as a vital part of a balanced portfolio, which can underpin the delivery of increasing amount of intermittent generation, including wind.  All power generation projects are subject to licensing by the Commission for Energy Regulation and predicated on the necessary connections from EirGrid.  There are a number of existing and planned open cycle gas generation projects by the State energy companies under the aegis of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5847">I am advised that ESB has three existing operational open cycle gas turbine plant located as follows: Aghada and Marina, both in County Cork, and North Wall in Dublin City.  Bord na Móna has recently commissioned two open cycle gas turbine generating units at Edenderry with a total capacity of 116MW.  I am advised by BGE that four Open Cycle Gas Generation projects at four separate locations are at various stages of planning, with some having progressed to securing grid connections.  Bord na Móna has received planning permission to construct a 170MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine Plant in County Offaly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5848">The expected date of commissioning of all these projects is not yet available and decisions will be subject to a variety of considerations, including financial, in light of current and projected capacity in the market.  There may also be plans for private sector projects involving open cycle gas turbine plant at various stages of development.  I would refer the Deputy to EirGrid publications for additional information on generation developments.  EirGrid's current Generation Adequacy Report 2010 to 2016, provides considerable detail on current, forthcoming and planned generation plants.</p>

            <p eId="para_5851">I propose to take Questions Nos. 468 and 469 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5852">My Department has not conducted studies or computer modelling specifically to evaluate modern pumped storage technology.  The "All Island Grid Study", jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Northern Ireland and published in 2008, examined the potential for renewable generated electricity systems to be handled on an all island basis by the grid transmission system.  As part of that work a very large scheduling model was constructed to provide dispatch information on all plants for the year 2020 for a number of portfolios, including fuel consumption, reserve allocation, imports and exports and CO2 emissions.  One of the technologies in the model was large scale pumped storage.  The findings of the study showed that penetration of up to 42% renewable electricity is technically feasible without any major increase in pumped storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5853">With regard to analysis conducted by agencies under the remit of my Department I understand that in the past year EirGrid has published two reports which include analysis of pumped storage.  The reports entitled ‘Generation Adequacy Report 2010–2016' and ‘Low Carbon Generation Options for the All Island Market' are available on the EirGrid website at <i>www.eirgrid.com</i>.  In addition, EirGrid is available to provide technical information and analysis to any group investigating the potential for large scale pumped storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5854">Energy storage has been developed over the years in Ireland where it can make a useful contribution to balancing electricity supply and consumer demand.  This is the case at the ESB's pumped water power station at Turlough Hill.  Pumped storage is one of a number of technical options for energy storage. I welcome all private endeavours seeking to promote and deploy renewable energy to the benefit of energy consumers.  It is the case that several parties are actively developing renewable energy proposals, which are predicated on or include, pumped storage projects.  Any successful deployment of economically viable and environmentally acceptable storage technologies would enhance the ability of the electricity grid to accept higher penetration levels of intermittent renewable generation.  Developments are being kept under close review by my Department in consultation with EirGrid and the energy sector.</p>

        <b>Deputy Enda Kenny</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         the figures or estimates for the mean annual wind speed at 50 metres above ground for each county; if he will provide those figures as a percentage of the total wind resource for each county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6314">Table 1 shows the seasonal and annual mean wind speeds per county.  The figures are a result of the modelling by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which produced the national wind atlas in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_6315">Historical weather datasets were compiled for intervals of six hours at all atmospheric levels.  Analysis was then performed using grids of successively finer mesh size to simulate conditions down to a grid size of 1km square.  The mesh size was further reduced (200m square) using a second model having regard to local land elevation, land cover and roughness.  A comparison was made between the predicted wind characterisation and those measured at a range of met sites across the country (but not in each county) to minimise the residual differences predicted and actual mean values encountered.</p>
            <p eId="para_6316">The mean wind speed figure might provide an indication for a county and a useful comparison of a county to other counties but local factors are always crucial in producing the actual mean wind speed at a site.  Such local factors include altitude, aspect, topography, land use and exposure.  As a result, the mean annual wind speed at different locations within a county can vary greatly. A particular site's annual mean wind speed can be estimated using the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's (SEAI) online wind atlas at http://maps.seai.ie/wind  .  This will provide a better indication of the potential mean wind speed in a locality as opposed to the county's mean figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6317">At a national level the estimated accessible wind resource on land in 2020 is 12,000 MW.  The methodology is set out in the SEAI publication Renewable Energy Resources in Ireland for 2010 and 2020 Report, 2004.  The accessible resource estimate accounts for the following constraints among others:</p>
            <p eId="para_6318">Minimum recommended spacing between turbines;</p>
            <p eId="para_6319">Extracted wind speeds below 7.5 metres per second;</p>
            <p eId="para_6320">Buffer zones on and around habitation, roads, lakes, infrastructure and airports;</p>
            <p eId="para_6321">Cost;</p>

        <b>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 100 Mbps fibre broadband is available in rural locations in the United Kingdom, such as Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, with the assistance of European funding through the European Regional Development Fund’s convergence programme; if he would consider organising a similar type scheme for west Cork with similar financial support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6530">Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market including (i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment (ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure, (iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide in cases of market failure and to meet certain of the State's own communication needs, and (iv) appropriate regulation.  The policy paper sets out the Government's position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_6531">The policy has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and increasing broadband speeds over recent years.  At the end of June 2010, for example, Ireland had in the region of 1.48 million broadband subscriptions and of the homes with broadband access 77.8% of them are using broadband speeds between 2mbps and 10mbps.  This progress was achieved by a combination of competitive forces in the open market and Government and ERDF funded schemes such as the Metropolitan Areas Networks programme and the National Broadband Scheme.  The latter schemes are designed to intervene where market failure has been identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_6532">This approach is also consistent with the EU Commission's ‘Community Guidelines on State Aid rules for broadband networks' (2009/C 235/04), which limit the circumstances in which the State can intervene in the broadband market.  The proposed Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly Next Generation Broadband scheme, referred to by the Deputy, was also examined under those guidelines as part of the EU State Aids clearance process.  I signalled last month that I have commenced the establishment of a Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, comprising industry, Government and ComReg, to consider how best to facilitate the roll out of next generation broadband in Ireland without compromising the competitive market principles and applicable EU rules.</p>

The actual cost to business of that information obligation and the total cost for my Department will shortly be measured in coordination with Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

            <p eId="para_6594">Under EU regulations governing the Disadvantaged Areas' Scheme and the Single Payments Scheme all ground eligibility inspections must be completed before any payment can issue to any applicant under either scheme, including those not selected for a ground eligibility inspection.  On the other hand cross-compliance inspections may be carried out within the calendar year and do not hold up payment.  Any undue payment detected as a result of a cross-compliance inspection can subsequently be recovered from the applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_6595">In 2010 some 3,500 farmers were selected for ground eligibility inspections and all of these inspections were completed in advance of the first payments made under the Disadvantaged Areas' Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme.  A further 4,200 inspections were conducted by remote sensing without the need to visit the farm.  In the vast majority of cases that were inspected, amendments have had to be made to the maps in order that the Land Parcel Identification System that is used for making payments to farmers is kept up-to-date.   Processing of these changes is continuing with priority being given to applications that were the subject of a ground eligibility inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_6596">My Department has received 123,000 applications under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme and 102,000 applications under the Disadvantaged Areas' Scheme.  When processing is completed it is expected that over 70,000 of these will have required the digitising of maps as a result of changes submitted by farmers.  This compares with an average of 22,000 digitising changes required in previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6597">With regard to the Single Payment Scheme, the total number of farmers paid since payments commenced less than two weeks ago is 108,845 farmers with an amount totalling €507.67 million. A further 1,046 farmers have their applications processed but payment cannot be made as the amount is less than €100. The number of farmers paid under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is 88,478 with the total amount paid at €169.7 million. There are a further 25,363 farmers, who have been partially paid. These will be paid their balancing payment as their cases are fully processed and <i> </i>cleared.</p>

            <p eId="para_6609">The number of eligible Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme applications amount to almost 130,000 per annum. As part of the application procedures for the both Schemes, applicants are requested to identify and remove ineligible areas, on maps provided by my Department, from their pre-printed land parcel details supplied by my Department. On receipt, the amended maps have to be processed and the changes identified by the applicants are digitised onto my Department's Land Parcel Identification System.</p>
            <p eId="para_6610">By the time the processing of the 2010 applications is completed, it is expected that we will have processed and digitised maps received from over 70,000 farmers. This compares with a figure of 30,000 for 2009 and an average of 22,000 maps in recent years. On average each farmer submitted two maps with their 2010 application forms.</p>
            <p eId="para_6611">The payment of the aid under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced on 22 September 2010. In order to enable my Department to make payments to many farmers as possible including those farmers with non-digitised maps, I decided to make a 75% advance payment to eligible farmers under this Scheme. The balancing payments were made on 20 October 2010 to all applicants, who were fully processed and clear. The total number of farmers paid to date under this Scheme is 88,478 with the total amount paid of €169.7 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_6612">The earliest permissible date for the payment under the Single Payment Scheme is 1st December. However in 2010 I made a special case to the European Commission and secured agreement to make an advance payment of 50% from 18 October. The total number of farmers paid since payments commenced two weeks ago is 108,845 farmers with an amount totalling €507.67 million. As in the case of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I arrange for payments to be made to applicants, where the only outstanding issue was non-digitised maps. The balancing payments of 50% will commence on 1 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_6613">In addition to the deployment of additional resources, a number of other initiatives were taken to enable payments (even if it was not the entire payment) to issue earlier that might have been the cases. These included paying on the eligible land that was digitised and clear.  The number of herds with maps processed on a weekly basis is some 3,000. To date we have processed 38,000 herds with re-digitising required. There are approximately 32,000 herds with maps to be re-digitised. This is a significant task and it is estimated that re-digitising will be completed in early 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_6614">I set a very demanding schedule of payments for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, Single Payment Scheme and the Grassland Sheep Scheme form September to December 2010. I intend to adhere to this schedule. In the meantime, multiple payment runs under the Schemes will be made on a weekly basis to pay farmers, whose applications are fully processed and clear.</p>

            <p eId="para_6722">There are a number of my Department's services, which have an on-line facility, including the Single Payment Scheme, Afforestation Aid Scheme and calf registration/animal movement. In total 3,127 Clare farmers, or their authorised agents, have registered for my Department's online services, to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_6723">Under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme, a total of 1,311 on-line applications were submitted by, or on behalf of, Clare farmers. In addition, 140 farmers/agents have uniquely used the Forestry online services to date, while 647 farmers have registered 16,983 calves, to date, during 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6724">In relation to the Single Payment Scheme, due to the system of in-built validations on the on-line facility, the options for applicants to make minor errors on their applications is dramatically restricted, as a result of which, those who submit their applications on-line are much more likely to have their applications cleared for payment more quickly. Analysis of the issues which delay processing of applications shows a very high percentage are delayed because of basic errors or omissions on the part of the applicant. However, it has been possible to construct the on-line facility with a series of compulsory fields and built-in validations, which dramatically reduces the level of these types of error, simply by refusing to allow the applicant to make the error in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6725">It was recognised from the outset that, in order to maximise the benefit of the on-line facility, a system of approved Agents would help maximise the numbers submitting applications on-line. While there are various reasons why individuals might not be in a position to lodge on-line applications, the Agent facility is attractive to those who wish to avail of the benefits of lodging an on-line application, although not in a position to do so personally. Anyone considering availing of the on-line facility to make enquiries via the website, www.agfood.ie   or, alternatively, the dedicated Helpdesk at Lo-call 1890 252 118.</p>
            <p eId="para_6726">The Deputy will also be aware that my Department earlier this year introduced a new online initiative which removed the requirement to maintain the on-farm bovine herd register, known as ‘the blue book' for those farmers who use www.agfood.ie   for electronic registration of births and movements. To date in Co Clare, 242 keepers have signed up to the online herd register and, in addition, 104 keepers have applied for compliance certificates online (farm to farm movement permits).</p>

            <p eId="para_6752">The Accreditation Review Group</p>
            <p eId="para_6753">The Accreditation Review Group (ARG) meets under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of the Department and includes representatives from the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Its primary function is to ensure that the Department retains its status as the accredited paying agency in Ireland for CAP Funds. In particular, the ARG monitors compliance with EU accreditation criteria and the follow up of all recommendations contained in the EU audits and the Certifying Body audits. The ARG first met in 1997 and has met quarterly every year since then.</p>

            <p eId="para_6755">The Risk Management Committee (RMC), chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, monitors the implementation of the Department's risk management system. The RMC first met in 2002 and has met quarterly every year since then.

            <p eId="para_6758">This Group replaced the Efficiency Review Group (ERG) which was established as a subcommittee of the MAC in October 2008.  Its remit was to facilitate a strategic approach to budgetary decision making, while addressing the structural changes necessary to enable the Department fulfil its wide ranging remit.  The ERG met on seven occasions from the time of its establishment.</p>

            <p eId="para_6760">My Department participated in the Inter-Departmental Group on Administration Burden Reduction.  This group is tasked with examining the administration burdens arising from obligations created under Irish legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6761">The measurement of administrative burdens using a Standard Cost Model is an exercise that was called for by business, as a baseline for the 25% administrative burden reduction programme and is being carried out across all Departments with any substantive regulation that affects business.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will shortly commence a process which will provide assistance to all Departments to measure the current costs on business arising from their national regulations.  As part of this process, this Department has provided the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation with a list of fifty information obligations, many of which are of minor nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_6762">However, the main schemes operated by my Department are operated under European legislation.  In that respect, the EU Commission presented in 2005 a Communication on Simplification and Better Regulation for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This set out an ambitious programme for a significant simplification of the CAP. The programme and its implementation are fully embedded in the overall Commission strategy on Better Regulation and in particular the Simplification Rolling Programme and the Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burden.  My Department has strongly supported the simplification process at European level which aims to reduce the administrative burden by some 25% by 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_6764">The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table on the basis agreed between the Deputy and an official in my Department. In that regard, subventions to the Agencies of my Department which are detailed in the Voted Expenditure / Appropriation Account for my Department each year are not detailed.  In addition, and as agreed with the Deputy, 1997 was used as the base-year as to trawl back earlier than that would have entailed a disproportionate amount of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6765">Individual grants for small schemes run by Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland (e.g. the Workplace Innovation Fund) are accounted for within the Annual Report and Accounts for that Agency and these accounts are lodged in the Oireachtas Library as a matter of course each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6766">Where grants are paid directly to private organizations, the provision of sets of audited accounts for those organisations is not always a requirement of the funding provision where their preparation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work for the body concerned.  In such circumstances, alternative arrangements operated by my Department would include requiring confirmation that conditions commensurate with good governance are operated by the body concerned, that the funding is drawn down on the provision of vouched receipts and, in some cases, auditor confirmation that the expenditure was incurred for the stated purpose of the particular grant.  In all cases of such schemes, my Department maintains appropriate records which are available for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_6833">My Department operates an early warning system of firms in difficulty and where jobs are at risk.  The system applies to firms that have been assisted by the Industrial Development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department.  Notifications of firms in difficulty and where jobs are at risk are received from these agencies as soon as the agencies become aware of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6834">I should point out that the information is provided on a confidential basis and it must remain confidential as, invariably, it is commercially sensitive information.  Such information could be of benefit to national or international competitors in the context of industrial projects already established in this country and our ability to attract further projects in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_6835">The Industrial Development agencies are in regular contact with their clients.  For example, when Enterprise Ireland is made aware of jobs at risk, it engages closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job loses to determine what appropriate proactive measures can be put in place by the Agency to prevent or minimise the job losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_6836">When IDA Ireland becomes aware of a company's intention to either downsize or cease operating in Ireland, it works with the client company to safe guard/influence/minimise the number of job losses through offering relevant interventions to assist their companies in improving competitiveness; enhance their use of technology; grow the skills of their employees; engage in research, development and innovation or develop their business processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6837">Similarly, as soon as Shannon Development the agency becomes aware of jobs at risk, it proactively engages with the company to offer whatever supports are available to minimise the impact as regards job losses.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Industrial Development agencies would look to anticipate potential problems and are always prepared and available to assist companies in whatever way they can in order to minimise or avoid job losses if at all possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_6843">My Department and the 8 Offices of my Department currently occupy 11 buildings within the State.  A list of the buildings involved is set out below as a tabular statement. All of the buildings listed in the tabular statement are occupied by the Department or the Offices of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6844">With the exception of a building in Shannon occupied by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), none of the buildings or premises occupied by my Department and the 8 Offices of my Department are rented or leased by the Department or the Offices concerned.  In general, all buildings and premises occupied by my Department and its Offices are provided by the Office of Public Works (OPW) without any cost to the Department or the Offices.  In many of those cases the buildings/premises are rented or leased by the OPW and the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost of same for 2008 and 2009 could only be supplied by the Office of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_6845">NERA's Shannon accommodation is held under a four-year licence agreement between the OPW and NERA on the one hand and Westpark Shannon Limited on the other.  The licence agreement commenced in February 2009.  The licence fee, which was paid by NERA in 2009, amounts to €156.08 per square metre, subject to a maximum charge of €32,480 per annum (exclusive of VAT). Since 1 January 2010 the OPW has assumed responsibility for the payment of the licence fee costs for NERA's Shannon accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6846">Due to the decentralisation process, the transfer of staff to other Government Departments and the reduction in staff levels generally in the Department and in the Offices of the Department in recent times, a certain amount of office space has become available in most of the buildings and my Department is currently engaged in a process to ensure that the buildings occupied by the Department and its Offices are occupied to the optimum levels possible.</p>

         when a redundancy claim will be processed in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_838">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_6877">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 09 August, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits  processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6878">In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved and claims dating from April 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_6879">My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_6880">Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>
            <p eId="para_6881">Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget   towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_6882">Establishment of a special call handling facility   in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_6883">Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_6884">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments   by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_6885">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.   In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first nine months of 2010 was 58,202 — up over 81% on the corresponding 9-month period in 2009 (32,127) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009 which came to 50,644.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a level of 29,776 as of the end of September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6886">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_6888">The Employment Subsidy Scheme (Temporary) was introduced to help employees maintain their jobs while at the same time assisting employers in retaining their productive capacity. There have been 2 calls under the Scheme and as a result almost 1,700 enterprises were approved for support with those companies committing to maintaining over 100,000 jobs to end November 2010.  There are no plans to extend the Scheme.  The Employment Subsidy Scheme is operated as part of an Irish state aid scheme approved under the European Commission's Temporary Framework on State aid. The Temporary Framework was introduced in December 2008 to allow Member States increased flexibility to assist companies in the real economy that were facing difficulties in accessing finance as a result of the economic downturn.  The Temporary Framework is due to expire at the end of December 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_6890">Purchasing decisions on individual software packages are taken on the basis of a wide range of factors including fit with the needs of the Department and its existing systems, availability of adequate support for critical IT systems, fit with my Department's support skills, up front cost, and total cost of ownership taking account of the foregoing factors.  Because of the complexity of these issues, it is not always possible to replace proprietary software with open source alternatives and it is not always clear what savings, if any, will arise from the use of such software.  Following competitive procurement procedures, purchasing decisions in relation to both software and consumables are made on foot of taking all such relevant factors into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_6891">Therefore, my Department uses open source software and generic consumables where they are evaluated as best meeting the Department's requirements.  As such, my Department does not track savings made through the use of open source software packages or generic consumables.  Costs are kept to a minimum through the use of this competitive tendering process rather than through specifying any particular brand of product.</p>

            <p eId="para_6914">I propose to take Questions Nos. 554, 556 and 559 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6915">International benchmarking statistics reveal that Ireland imposes a relatively low burden of regulation on business. The Forfás Annual Competitiveness Report 2010 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation, the time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.</p>
            <p eId="para_6916">The work to reduce red tape in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts. The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business; and an Inter-Departmental Group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, coordinates the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognized Standard Cost Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_6917">The High Level Group has processed thirty specific red tape issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on a further thirty-eight items. The Group has measured over €20m of annual business savings and continues to work with business interests to identify opportunities for simplification.  In addition, my Department is in the process of measuring other burden reductions achieved.  These burden reductions include simplification procedures in relation to waste collection permits, increased availability of online forms in the CRO and pre-filled on line forms and the facilitation of companies to upload their accounts in PDF format.  A list of priority simplifications achieved is currently being compiled for measurement.  The results of this measurement exercise are expected to be published in the second half of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6918">The measurement of administrative burdens using the Standard Cost Model is an exercise that was called for by business, as a baseline for the 25% administrative burden reduction programme, and is being carried out across all Departments with any substantive regulation that affects business.  My Department and the Central Statistics Office have already measured burdens arising from regulations under their responsibility, and all other Departments will shortly measure the current costs on business arising from their regulation.  Measurement is expected to be completed in 2011 and, following this, simplification plans will be developed in consultation with stakeholders, for implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6919">The results of the measurement exercise conducted by my Department during 2009 involving thirty-one priority Information Obligations is available on my Department's website at   http://www.deti.ie/commerce/businessregulation/index.htm  These results have been combined with measurements conducted on behalf of the High Level Group and by the European Commission to present a comprehensive picture of administrative burdens in these areas.  Following the inclusion of these additional measurements, as well as some consolidation of related Information Obligations (for example, there are three closely related requirements associated with Annual General Meetings), there are now thirty-three priority Information Obligations included under Company Law, Employment Law and Health &amp; Safety Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_6920">The total Administrative Burden for the three areas, following this consolidation of results, is €831 million.  The consolidated results are also available on my Department's website.  These results are in line with expectations, as compared with the results obtained by the UK in their measurement.  Business workshops have already been held to identify ideas for simplification in the areas of Company Law and Employment Law.  A Health &amp; Safety Law workshop is scheduled for 9 November 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_7096">The work to reduce red tape in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts. The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business; and an Inter-Departmental Group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, coordinates the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognized Standard Cost Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_7097">The Inter-Departmental Group has met to coordinate and drive the process on nine occasions to date as follows: 18th July 2008, 26th September 2008, 6th November 2008, 10th December 2008, 26th January 2010, 23rd February 2010, 22nd March 2010, 13th April 2010, 12th May 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_7098">The measurement of administrative burdens using the Standard Cost Model is an exercise that was called for by business, as a baseline for the 25% administrative burden reduction programme, and is being carried out across all Departments with any substantive regulation that affects business. My Department and the Central Statistics Office have already measured burdens arising from regulations under their responsibility, and all other relevant Departments will shortly measure the current red tape costs on business arising from their regulation. Measurement is expected to be completed in 2011 and, following this, a report on the measurement process will be published.  Also following the measurement process, simplification plans will be developed in consultation with stakeholders, for implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_7102">The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in April 2003, to the end of September 2010, the transfers to the DAF have totalled some €587.5m, which includes interest earned of some €34.4m.  Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to approximately €202m.</p>
            <p eId="para_7103">Allocations from the DAF — in accordance with Part 6 of the Acts, as amended by the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005 — are focussed on programmes or projects to assist:</p>
            <p eId="para_7104">1. the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged;</p>

            <p eId="para_7106">3. persons with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_7107">The value of the DAF at the end of September 2010, net of liabilities, was some €62.4m.  This figure excludes €44.4m maintained in a Reserve Account to meet future reclaims by account holders and to cover expenses associated with the operation of the DAF.   Further details of projects to which funding has been allocated to date and a summary of the status of the DAF are available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie/en/DormantAccounts  .</p>
            <p eId="para_7108">As regards the annual expenses of the Dormant Accounts Board (DAB), the figure of €1.7m referred to by the Deputy is presumably the 2009 outturn for Dormant Accounts Administration (Subhead B.6 of my Department's Vote). This expenditure covered Pobal's administration fee for administering the various Dormant Accounts measures across all Government Departments, as well as the administrative budget for the DAB itself. That administrative budget amounted to €210,465, broken down as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_7135">In excess of €31 million is being made available to fund the activities of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces in 2010. The table at Appendix 1 details the expenditure by the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) for 2006-09 inclusive, as well as the 2010 allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7136">Sustained incremental funding up to 2008 facilitated, amongst others, the strengthening of existing projects in the LDTF areas, the rolling out of projects and initiatives in the RDTF areas, the introduction of new initiatives and responses to address cocaine usage, measures to support rehabilitation and the ongoing investment in capital projects.  These are recognised by Government as key areas to support communities to address the harm caused by problem drugs use and to deliver meaningful solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7137">In the main, each Drugs Task Force (DTF) has a Co-ordinator, a Development Worker and an Administrator. Detailed information concerning on the breakdown of staff and salary scales is currently being collated and I will arrange to send the information requested directly to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_7138">Membership is comprised of representation from Departments and statutory agencies, the voluntary sector, the community sector and elected representatives. Representatives of Departments and statutory agencies are nominated by their employer, with community sector representatives nominated by local Partnerships and community groups.  Voluntary sector representatives are nominated following consultation between the DTF and the voluntary drug treatment sector.  Elected representatives are nominated through the relevant local authority, though DTFs may agree alternative arrangements if they wish.  Generally, tenure should be such as to ensure continuity and consistency in the approach of the DTF in responding to the drug problem in its area.</p>
            <p eId="para_7139">Funding and accounting for DTF projects is channelled through Channels of Funding, including HSE, FÁS, Local Authorities and VECs.  Liaison members of the Drugs Advisory Group, which meets monthly, provide a liaison, reporting and representational role between the Task Forces and the Office of the Minister for Drugs. It is also intended that, starting in 2011, Drugs Task Forces will additionally report on a six-monthly basis to the Office of the Minister for Drugs on their activities, including their broader strategic and co-ordination work.</p>

         the persons or bodies in receipt of subventions or grants from his Department; the amount paid to each recipient in the year such payments commenced; the amount paid to each recipient in the current year; to place in the Oireachtas Library the latest two sets of accounts for these payments furnished by such persons or bodies to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7325">As the Deputy is aware, my Department administers and delivers a wide range of programmes and measures, descriptions of which are available on our website at www.pobail.ie  . In addition, details of payments made from subheads part-funded from the National Lottery are listed on my Department's website.  My Department's gross expenditure outturn for 2008 was €540.421m and for 2009 was €458.863m. The Further Revised Estimate gross allocation for 2010 is €440.864m. The table provides a breakdown for each of my Department's programme areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7326">The number of individuals and bodies in receipt of subventions or grants from my Department under these programme areas, either directly or through agencies and other intermediary bodies, would be considerable.  In view of the wide range of my Department's schemes and programmes and the large volumes of applications received thereunder on an ongoing basis, I am not satisfied that the work involved in compiling and collating the breakdown of expenditure sought by the Deputy would be feasible or justified. However, if the Deputy has any specific queries relating to a particular scheme, I would be glad to seek to provide him with the relevant information.</p>

            <p eId="para_7400">The issue of improving both the frequency and nature of access to the island of Inis Bigil, County Mayo has been addressed by my Department in recent years by way of significant current and capital investment.  A daily ferry service which provides two return sailings per day between Inis Bigil and Doran's Point on the mainland and a connecting bus service to Ballycroy are subsidised by my Department. The cost of subventing these services in 2010 amounts to €36,859.</p>
            <p eId="para_7401">Improvements to piers on the island and the mainland have also been carried out with assistance from my Department.  Between 2002 and 2010, more than €1.4m has been allocated to Mayo County Council to carry out improvement works on the piers at Gob na Dumhaí and Beal an Bhulláin on Inis Bigil and at Doran's Point and Dún Ibhir on the mainland. In relation to matters raised by the Deputy in ‘the details supplied', my officials have had discussions with the island's community representatives in regard to those matters that come within the remit of my Department.  Other matters referred to come within the statutory remit of other agencies.  While recognising the constraints imposed by a ‘details supplied' Question, I would be pleased to provide further clarification to the Deputy directly if he so wishes.</p>

The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is coordinating the overall process to measure and reduce burdens on business across Government.  I can advise the Deputy that a screening process was undertaken in my Department to establish whether any domestic legislation for which my Department is responsible gave rise to administrative burdens on business and to identify any information obligations on business.  Following this process, no such information obligations were identified in my Department and accordingly since December 2008 my Department is no longer represented on the Inter Departmental Group on Administrative Burden Reduction.</p>

This is an operating system and has been in use for over 7 years on our MIF (Management Information Framework) servers. It is not possible to quantify how much of a saving has been made through the use of this software.  The Department does not currently use generic consumables. The use of generic toner cartridges has been tried in the past, however the results were mixed and consequently there were no reportable savings.</p>
