          <p eId="para_2">I answered a similar question in the House on 15 October last year and I refer the Deputy to the comprehensive answer I gave on that occasion. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, as Chief Whip, is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and the Government's programme for Dáil reform. She also oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme and is responsible for the Central Statistics Office. She also has special responsibility for information society development with particular regard to advancing strategic priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The other Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, has a pivotal role in advancing preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union next year. In addition, he has a heavy workload within the Department of Foreign Affairs representing the Government at meetings in a wide range of contexts related to European affairs and representing Ireland at EU meetings at Minister of State level on European Union affairs. He is also extensively engaged in his role as the Government's representative on the Convention on the Future of Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">Does the Taoiseach accept that Ireland's low ranking at 25th among OECD countries in the international information society index and in the e-rankings as published by <i>The Economist Intelligence Unit, </i>underlines the need for a more aggressive approach to the e-commerce brief by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin?</p>

          <p eId="para_8">The responsibilities of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, do not impinge on the specific functions assigned to individual Ministers or Departments relating to the infrastructural issues around commerce in the telecommunications infrastructure. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has the functional responsibilities but the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, is responsible for co-ordinating the continuing development of the information society, ensuring that information society issues are prioritised across all Departments – from monitoring implementation of the new connections action plan to co-ordinating the implementation of the e-Europe action plan up to 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The key structures are in place to deal with that – the Cabinet committee on the information society is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin; there is a strategy group at Secretary General level and there is the information society implementation group of assistant secretaries. Other Ministers have responsibility for different areas. Numerous reports with differing criteria address various IT infrastructural issues. In some of these reports, Ireland is at number one; in others, at the bottom; and in yet others still, in the middle. Through various Departments and agencies, we are constantly trying to achieve as much as possible to be among the higher level groupings.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">Given that it appears Ireland has slipped in the international pecking order in this vital area of development, does the Taoiseach agree that it is necessary to take specific initiatives to retrieve the situation which prevailed ten years ago, when our world ranking in e-commerce and IT was among the best under every heading? Does he further agree that, unless we return to this situation, our international position will get worse?</p>

          <p eId="para_12">It is our intention to stay up the pecking order. Many of the technologies and the work with which the Minister for State is involved, in trying to keep us to the forefront, were not invented three years ago. The rate of change in the area is immense. I assure the  Deputy that we are trying to keep ourselves at the front line in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, has tabled a comprehensive paper, on which he acted as <i>rapporteur,</i> on the institutional issues of the Convention on the Future of Europe. He has also submitted other papers along with other Members. He is gaining support for that and trying to pull together the views of the smaller countries on the institutional issues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_14">Most of the proposals put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, are voluminous. With regard to the e-commerce responsibilities allocated to the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, it is her responsibility to co-ordinate e-commerce services between Departments and agencies of the State. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for providing the engine for that, the roll-out of broadband. Is it not a fact, therefore, that the Minister of State's brief is constrained by the lack of action in the provision of broadband? The Minister recently announced the roll-out of broadband around certain towns but it is virtually impossible to dig up every lane and road in the country to provide that cable. Will the Minister of State be facilitated, in respect of her e-commerce brief, by an additional emphasis on wireless technology to facilitate the physical provision of e-commerce?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_10">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_15">It should be clarified that e-commerce is within the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. Broadband is in the brief of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Neither of them is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_17">Technology applies across practically every area. Broadband is being rolled out and the first 17 areas are under operation at present. It is a short procedure. Wireless technology has been examined. Wireless technology is grand if it is within a complex. The technology is constantly advancing and changing, even in the last 18 months. At the last committee meeting I saw a brief on some of the latest technology. Wireless technology works fine in an area such as Government Buildings but it would not work in an area of the west of Ireland away from a centre. It would still be necessary to roll-out broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The plan in the short-term is to roll-out broadband to the 17 towns. Over the next few years, there is a progressive plan to bring it to 123 towns. The resources have been provided for that in the national development plan. It is not possible, and will not be possible in the foreseeable future, to have it in every village and town in the country. I agree with the Deputy that as wireless  technology improves we should use it where possible. However, it is limited. There was a theory a couple of years ago that wireless technology would work anywhere but, like the operation of mobile telephones, telexes and so forth, the same difficulty arises. It has a use and a value but it is limited. In the areas where one would wish it to work, it is more limited than broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">It is not a case of either one or the other. The broadband roll-out provided for in the five year programme must take place and the resources are available for it. Wireless technology can then be used in a more focused and limited area.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">When Senator O'Rourke was the Minister in that Department she initiated a pilot project in parts of the west of Ireland and some other areas using satellite facilities.

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_22">Is that experiment likely to be continued? In areas that neither wireless nor cable will ever reach, it allows e-commerce to be made available across the board and, in that regard, facilitates equality of opportunity. Will the Taoiseach comment on this and assure the House that, in so far as it is possible, the momentum will be maintained?</p>

          <p eId="para_24">The Taoiseach has correctly pointed out that 17 towns are earmarked for what are called "fibre rings", which is part of the strategy to roll-out broadband. Is the Taoiseach confirming that the other towns in phases 2 and 3 of the fibre ring project, making up a total of 123, will go ahead on time? My understanding is that phases 2 and 3 were to be delayed. Will the Taoiseach confirm that after the 17 towns have been completed—</p>

          <p eId="para_29">The intention is to roll-out the first stage of that project. As Deputy Coveney is aware, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has made it clear that broadband remains the top information society priority. It came originally from the Forfás report. The Minister has started rolling out areas and he has the resources to do so in the national development plan. It is the intention to keep on doing that, whether or not we can get to 123 towns within the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Deputy will also be aware that the operational advances in doing this by using rail links and other methods are not nearly as complex as they were when we started the project three or four years ago. There are imaginative ways of doing it that are less disruptive. We were told, for example, that the construction programme for the 17 towns would be quite long. Deputy Kenny will be aware that one of the largest initial projects in Ballina was only announced in February and finished in May. Therefore, it is useful to know the actual construction time and cost involved, and we can gauge them quite quickly in doing this. On the satellite issue, we are moving ahead on some of those in both first and second level education.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I have not yet received the report of the commission of inquiry. The commission is currently engaged in writing its report, which Mr. Justice Barron expects to complete in the near future. It is envisaged that the report prepared by Mr. Justice Barron will be submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, as originally agreed with Opposition parties and the group Justice for the Forgotten. The Government envisages that the committee, in public session, will consider the follow-up to the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">As this matter appears to have been going on forever, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is receiving all the necessary information it requires from the relevant British authorities? If the Taoiseach is happy in that respect, why has the commission's report not yet been published? Why is it only now being written? When I questioned the Taoiseach about this matter on 6 November 2002, the indications were that it would be published early in the new year. As the Taoiseach will be aware, this is a matter of grave personal concern to the victims' families, some of whom are in regular contact with me. If the Taoiseach is not happy with the situation, has he raised it with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in his recent discussions with him? In so far as the British authorities are concerned, extra procedures should be put in place to give Mr. Justice Barron all the information and evidence he requires to complete his work.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">The Government has given Mr. Justice Barron all the resources and assistance he  requires. He is currently writing the report. As Deputy Kenny correctly stated, when we discussed this matter in November, there were delays concerning the level of information the judge required from the British authorities. I raised the matter at that time with the British Prime Minister. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also raised it with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as he had done with the previous Secretary of State. Mr. Justice Barron has been in touch directly with those involved for some time. Contacts were arranged from that process. We now have to wait until the publication of the report to see whether Mr. Justice Barron is satisfied with the material he has received from the British authorities. He will deal with that matter in his report. I hope it will be ready before the summer, and I understand it will be.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that the Victims Commission's recommendations which were published in August 1999 have not yet been implemented? Is there a set of reasons this has not been happened or will the Taoiseach request his Department to examine this matter to ensure that the recommendations, either in their entirety or in part, are implemented as soon as possible?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_47">The intention is that this report, which was undertaken by a former Tánaiste, John Wilson, will be implemented. A major part of the proposal in that regard was announced last month. To fulfil the Government's obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, we are allocating €3 million this year towards addressing the needs of those in this jurisdiction who suffered from violent action arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland. That money is to be allocated by a commission to be known as the Remembrance Fund Commission. It is analogous to the memorial fund in Northern Ireland which has been set up. I answered a question here recently in this regard and outlined that this commission will be established on a statutory basis in the near future. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce the necessary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">For the information of the House, the establishment of the commission follows on from the work of Mr. Wilson and the publication of the commission report. The intention is that this commission will be used to make sure that report's recommendations are implemented. An interdepartmental group has been working on the implementation of the financial recommendations of the Wilson report and some of the other recommendations. We are now well on the way to implementing that report.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">On the matter of co-operation from the British authorities and the exchanges that have taken place in the House previously  about queries the Taoiseach had raised and queries that were raised through the Anglo-Irish secretariat and so on about the quality and extent of co-operation by the British authorities, is the Taoiseach saying he will not know until Mr. Justice Barron reports whether Mr. Justice Barron is satisfied that whatever tardiness was there has now been cleared up and whether the quality and extent of information is what it ought to be?</p>
          <p eId="para_50">With regard to the trust being established to meet the grievances of the relatives, in respect of those who were unfortunately killed and in respect of those who were injured – who have a real sense of understandable grievance, in that compensation, where it was paid out, was very paltry and minimalist – irrespective of the reporting from the Barron inquiry the commission can go ahead and allocate those moneys. How does the Taoiseach propose that the fund set up will be distributed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_51">The Deputy has raised two questions. The House will recall that last year there was a long and protracted discussion about trying to get the necessary information for Mr. Justice Barron. That process came to an end. Mr. Justice Barron received some information and he was in direct communications and had meetings in regard to other aspects of this matter. Mr. Justice Barron operates independently; he does not report to me, but I am aware of some of those connections. He has not asked me since the beginning of the new year to make any further contacts. Deputy Rabbitte has correctly summarised what I stated. Whether Mr. Justice Barron is satisfied with what he got I do not know. I know he has information but I do not know if he has all the information he needs or if that information is satisfactory. We will have to await the report to see how he deals with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Regarding the second matter, I hope the funding the Government has allocated will be allocated by a body to be known as the Remembrance Fund Commission. It will be more or less analogous to the memorial fund in Northern Ireland and will be established on a statutory basis. When I answered a question on this recently I said I would check it and I confirm that this has to be done on a statutory basis. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring in the appropriate legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_53">I know the Taoiseach does not have day to day responsibility for this and that Mr. Justice Barron does not report to him but obviously there must be contact. The Taoiseach says he hopes Mr. Justice Barron will report before the summer; does he have any real expectation that that will happen? Does he have any knowledge about this? There must be contact, so what are the delays? Obviously the relatives are concerned that this is going on interminably. There does not seem to be any end in sight, particularly as we do not know what will be in the report. We do not know the view of the relevant  Oireachtas committee which will examine the report either. However, at least there will be some clarity at that stage. Will the Taoiseach consider the assumption that Mr. Justice Barron has gone as far as he can and that it is now desirable we get a report for consideration by the relevant Oireachtas committee?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_31">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_54">That is the stage we have reached and Mr. Justice Barron is completing his work. He and Mr. Justice Hamilton before him were engaged in an enormous amount of work and they received co-operation from everybody willingly before running into difficulties with different sections of the British establishment. However, to the extent that it can be completed the work is done and Mr. Justice Barron is writing the report. Some officials have been seconded to this work from my Department so there may still be some contact regarding certain aspects of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">In preparing for this question I inquired this morning as to when we would have the report and was told we would have it before the summer break. I hasten to add I was not told by the eminent judge but by officials. I was told we would have it by the summer break.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_32">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_56">Does the Taoiseach accept that while a great deal of work was undertaken by Mr. Justice Barron, the critical issue holding up production of the report was the unwillingness of some elements of the British establishment to respond to Mr. Justice Barron's requests for information? The last time we discussed this I suggested to the Taoiseach that Mr. Justice Barron had sought very specific information under a range of headings from the British authorities and I understood the Taoiseach gave a commitment to try to ensure those specific requests were responded to. Since the last time we raised this matter, have the British authorities responded to the issues raised by Mr. Justice Barron or is he throwing his hands up in desperation and proceeding with a report on the basis that he will not get full co-operation from the British authorities? Are there lines of communication between the relatives' organisation, Justice for the Forgotten, and the Department of the Taoiseach? Are the relatives being kept informed of progress, if we can call it progress, on this issue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_33">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_57">The relatives have been kept informed. Mr. Justice Barron, to his credit, has met the relatives and kept them informed, as have officials assigned to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">My understanding is that Mr. Justice Barron has received the information he sought. I do not know whether it is complete or to his satisfaction but we have stopped seeking information. We asked Prime Minister Blair to help in this matter and he did so. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, has been particularly helpful since he took up his position some months  ago. It remains to be seen if all the information requested has been made available. I put on record my doubts in that regard many months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">I cannot answer the question on whether Mr. Justice Barron is satisfied. We have received much better co-operation and assistance in recent months, particularly the final months of last year, than previously, but we will have to wait for the report to see if this co-operation has been complete. As previously agreed, the report will be passed to the relevant committee of the House as soon as we receive it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_34">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_60">Does the Taoiseach agree with the impression I sometimes have during questions about the 1974 bombings and other bombings in this State around that time, that parties on both sides of the House are all in opposition as we tend to ask questions about a Government in Westminster which is not accountable to this House? We should focus on the role of the Government which is accountable to the House. The Taoiseach stated the report of the Barron commission of inquiry is expected to be published by the summer break. Does this mean the summer break of 2003? Given that he based his statement on the word of officials, does he believe the report will be published on time or has allowance been made for a degree of flexibility?</p>
          <p eId="para_61">If the relatives and victims of the atrocities are to get anything from today's questions, they would appreciate finding out not only when Mr. Justice Barron's report will be published, but whether a date has been set for the publication of the legislation to establish the remembrance commission fund. Is the Government working to a timeframe for establishing the promised fund? The matter has been discussed in the House, yet no date has been given.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_35">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_62">I will take the second question first. A statement on the remembrance commission fund was made on 27 February. The necessary resources have been made available in this financial year and it will be established as quickly as the legislation can be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Regarding the Deputy's first question, which other Deputies also asked, I wish to make the position clear. Since the receipt of the official material from the British authorities last year, further material was received by Mr. Justice Barron related to queries raised with him. As I stated, the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, has been helpful in this regard. Mr. Justice Barron has been in touch with British officials again recently but I do not know the nature of that contact.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Clearly some time was lost last year, but Mr. Justice Barron continued his work on the Seamus Ludlow and Dundalk bombings cases. I am not sure if his report will be composite because these incidents were treated separately at the time we asked him to deal with them. There will probably be separate reports. I do not have control over  the time of publication, but I have no reason to believe Mr. Justice Barron is doing other than his utmost to bring this matter to completion.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_36">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_65">Will the Taoiseach offer his view on the reason the British authorities have refused to co-operate fully with the Hamilton and Barron inquiries and the reason we had to wait until the appointment of the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, before, as he stated, the situation improved? It will task many of the families of the victims and those who are concerned to see a satisfactory resolution of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">In respect of the other cases Mr. Justice Barron has been asked to address, has he received all the co-operation he would require in terms of addressing the 1974 bombing of Castleblayney, which saw the death of Patrick Mohan and the murder of John Francis Green? Does the Taoiseach believe that Mr. Justice Barron will be able to fulsomely report on all those additional areas of inquiry he was requested to address?</p>
          <p eId="para_67">On the question of the Remembrance Fund Commission, I would like to ascertain from the Taoiseach, in a more specific way if at all possible, when he expects legislation to be brought before this House and when the detail of access to the fund that has been indicated for the current year will be advised to victims to effect application? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the €3 million set aside this year is but the first tranche of a fund that will continue and be open to application in subsequent years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_37">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_68">As I have stated in reply to Deputy Sargent, I hope that legislation will be brought forward as soon as possible because the resources are available for this year and the fund will continue until it has completed its remit, which will probably take some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">On the other question, the position at the beginning of the year was that Mr. Justice Barron's intention was to publish his findings on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in one report and to deal with the Dundalk bombing and the Seamus Ludlow case in a separate report. I have no information to show that that position has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">In reply to the Deputy's first question, as he is aware I have put my view on that on the record on a number of occasions when we sought co-operation from different Secretaries of State and officials in the British establishment. We probably got what was contained in the departmental records at an early date because the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, instructed the release of anything contained in those records, but I am sure some of them contain information on how the Northern Ireland Office and the related system operates. That information was in security and intelligence files and, as the Deputy is aware, perhaps more so than myself, it is a hard task to get at those files.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_71">In his reply the Taoiseach referred to the Dundalk bombings and the Seamus Ludlow case. In my question I specifically referred to the 1974 bombing in Castleblayney which resulted in the death of Patrick Mohan and the murder of John Francis Green but the way the Taoiseach responded causes me some concern. Will the Taoiseach confirm that both of those tragic events have also been included in the remit of Mr. Justice Barron?</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_75">If my memory serves me correctly, the investigation was initially set up in January 2000, which is three years ago. Will the Taoiseach agree it is absolutely intolerable that he, as the Prime Minister of this State, is not in a position to tell us that the level of co-operation from the British authorities has been sufficiently satisfactory to enable a complete report to be written by Mr. Justice Barron? In view of the fact that the Taoiseach is supposed to have an excellent relationship with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, who promised the Taoiseach that he would get the information out, will he agree that elements of the security forces in Britain have deliberately obstructed the full information coming out? Is it the case that we have not heard the full truth of the tragic atrocities that constitute the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?</p>
          <p eId="para_76">This is the fourth or fifth occasion on which we have questioned the Taoiseach on this issue, and the information we got has been utterly inadequate. The Taoiseach apparently had a great deal of difficulty dragging anything from the British authorities. Does the Taoiseach agree that it has taken so long to extract information and the information has been so insufficient that if the Irish Government applied to Mr. Blair's tardiness on the matter the same yardstick as Mr. Blair has applied to Saddam Hussein with regard to information on alleged weapons of mass destruction, the Taoiseach might have dispatched an Air Corps Cessna over No. 10 Downing Street to throw a few hand grenades down to wake the Prime Minister so we get the information?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_43">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_77">We have been over this ground before – the questions have been answered – and it is unnecessary to go over it again. The late Mr. Justice Hamilton was and now Mr. Justice Barron is engaged in reconstructing as much of  the data and information as possible that surrounds the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974 and some of the related bombings elsewhere, such as the Dublin bombings in 1972, the Dundalk bombings and the murder of Séamus Ludlow. They went through departmental and Garda files and sought information from the British. I asked Prime Minister Tony Blair to assist and we received all available departmental records. There was a delay with the NIO and some Secretaries of State – I do not think I am being unkind when I say that – but the present Secretary of State, Mr. Paul Murphy, has been very active in assisting us.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Some of the security information was difficult to obtain. Mr. Justice Barron asked questions, held meetings and got information. He is conducting the inquiry, not me, and I will have to wait for his report to find out his ultimate conclusions on the quality of the information he was given and the answers he received. I am not sure if he got all the information but we must wait for the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The House appreciates that we are trying to reconstruct as much of the information as possible, taking into account that the inquiry was set up 26 years after the events. Those were extraordinary times and circumstances, as I mentioned previously. There have been three years of intensive investigation, which has benefited from the work of the victims' families, the Justice for the Forgotten movement and others. We will wait for the report and see what it says.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">There have been enormous efforts to put the report together. I do not want it to be interpreted that the report has concentrated for three years on one small aspect which may or may not be resolved. It is a much more comprehensive job that is now nearing completion. That is how we should view the current position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_44">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_81">It sometimes seems as if there will never be closure on this issue – it is almost 30 years since the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. When the Taoiseach came into the House previously he indicated that there was a new spirit of co-operation from the British authorities on the matter. He gave the impression that there was significant material available to Mr. Justice Barron. Will he state whether that material is of some significance which was not the case previously? Hitherto, the general impression was that there had not been co-operation from the British authorities. Is this the first element of co-operation and is that the reason it has taken so long to complete the report? The Taoiseach stated that Mr. Justice Barron would complete the report before summer. On the basis that spring starts at the beginning of February and we are now at the end of March, are we to take it that the report will be presented by the end of April, or is there a different interpretation of that?</p>
          <p eId="para_82">With regard to matters arising from the report of the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, and the good news that €3 million will be made available,  when will the relevant legislation be introduced? Obviously, all sides of this House will be anxious to facilitate that, as would the relatives of the victims. Given that the matter will be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, is the Taoiseach supportive of the idea that Mr. Justice Barron should come before that committee and that the committee should also receive a delegation from Justice for the Forgotten?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_45">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_83">On the matter of legislation, I am supportive of its being dealt with as quickly as possible. The resources are available and it would be helpful to the relatives to move matters forward. In my previous statements on this matter I referred to departmental information, which is not difficult to obtain, information from the NIO, which did prove difficult to obtain, and information on the security position, which was even more difficult to obtain. We now have support from Prime Minister Blair and, particularly, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, in dealing with the matter. I believe that Mr. Justice Barron is satisfied with that co-operation as I indicated previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Having regard to the long period of time involved, there are difficulties in bringing all the information together. I believe that Deputies will agree it has been a considerable achievement, within a relatively short period of three years, to piece together the events of 27 years ago to complete this report. On the time factor, one of the things I have learned in the course of this job is that it is not a good idea to question the work of judges and, accordingly, that is something which I no longer do. I hope it will be ready soon.</p>

      <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
       her strategy to tackle inflation in view of the commitments to do so as part of the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress 2003-2005, and taking account of the serious deterioration in economic competitiveness, which is resulting in a rising trend of job losses; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
      [8352/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_46">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_86">While the recent trend in job losses is primarily the result of the continued low levels of growth in many of our export markets, the partnership programme, Sustaining Progress, recognises that renewing competitiveness, both within the domestic economy and on the international stage, is central to the overall macroeconomic policy of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth and high levels of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The effective reduction of inflation requires  actions by all social partners. Government has a major role but it requires the active support of the social partners. The Government is already taking measures to improve our competitiveness that will play a critical role in the fight against inflation. These include strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance, increasing investment in research, technology and innovation which will provide the basis for future productivity growth and continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as broadband telecommunications.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Increasing competition and implementing necessary structural reforms is critical to controlling inflationary pressures in the domestic services sector which has been the source of much of our recent inflation. The powers and resources of the Competition Authority have been increased substantially to enable it to effectively tackle cartels and abuses of dominant position and to recommend regulatory reforms to improve competition in key markets. As part of this work, the Authority is carrying out a detailed study of eight professions and only last week published a consultancy study that will serve as the basis for a report and recommendations by the authority on each of the professions in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I am also in the process of implementing a programme to fundamentally reform the insurance market to tackle the issue of high premiums which have had a detrimental effect both on consumers and on business competitiveness. This programme is already having an impact and it is heartening to note the recent reported comments from a number of major motor insurers here, that in one area they have already reduced premiums. I am committed to continuing with the reform programme and bringing about improvements in the functioning of the insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"><i>Additional information</i>In addition to effective competition it is also important to ensure that shoppers have the necessary information so that they can make the best choice to suit their needs. Earlier this year I introduced new regulations, which oblige retailers to display both general price information and a unit price – that is, price per kilogramme or per litre – for all packaged products sold by quantity. This will enable consumers to make accurate and immediate comparisons as between competing products that are sold by quantity. This is part of an ongoing campaign to increase consumer information and awareness.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_47">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_91">Does the Minister share my alarm at the recent finding by a Forfás report that one in five of the jobs within IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have been lost in the past two years? This is an alarming increase in job losses in those sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">At a time when prices for manufacturing goods are falling – they have fallen by 3% in absolute  terms since April – would the Tánaiste agree that the Government's policy of stealth taxes is making it harder for companies to hold jobs? Does she agree that stealth taxes have added 2% to the cost of inflation, as recently estimated in one prominent newspaper?</p>
          <p eId="para_93">She made much publicised comments at Davos that if her colleagues had had their way inflation would be much worse. What exactly would have happened, in relation to stealth taxes and other inflationary impacting measures, if her colleagues had got their way?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_48" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_94">Obviously everybody must be concerned about any job losses and unfortunately in the past 12 months we have seen a huge increase in the number of job losses and notified redundancies over and above previous years. However unemployment remains very low at 4.5%, employment is still growing and since 1997 we have added an additional 307,000 to the numbers employed in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">In the context of the recent budget, we were mindful of the impact that any decisions we might make would have on inflation and a number of decisions that could have been made in order to raise much needed revenue for expenditure in key areas were not pursued by the Government in order to keep to a minimum the impact the budget would have had on the rate of inflation. We kept that impact to well below 1%, as the Deputy will be aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">On decisions of State companies to increase the cost of utilities or whatever, clearly companies must operate commercially. The most important way we can affect inflation is through enhanced competition across the economy. That is why it has been a priority of mine to both increase the powers of, and the resources available to, the Competition Authority and also, where possible, to introduce competition. We need to do a great deal more of it, particularly in the sheltered sector of the economy.</p>

      <b>Mr. Howlin</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
       the number of redundancies notified to her Department during 2000, 2001, 2002 and to date; the steps being taken to deal with the sharp increase in redundancies; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
      [8196/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_107">The numbers of redundancies notified to my Department in the years mentioned by the Deputy are 13,316 in 2000, 19,977 in 2001, 25,358 in 2002 and 4,264 up to the end of February 2003. The increase in redundancies which these figures represent must be seen in the context of the international economic environment in recent years. Even before the current uncertainties relating to Iraq, a sequence of events had acted to produce an international economic downturn, manifested in weak global demand, volatile stock markets, curtailment of investment and a fall-off in business confidence generally. Global economic conditions remained weak in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">As an open economy, Ireland cannot hope to remain unaffected by events in the global market place in which it operates. The increased level of job losses occurring here is a reflection of slower economic activity experienced in Ireland in line with adverse global economic conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">In dealing with closures and major job losses, the State agencies under the aegis of my Department work closely with the companies affected and local interests in addressing the difficulties arising and seek alternative employment opportunities and provide training for the workers affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">In a difficult economic environment, the IDA continues to enjoy considerable success in promoting Ireland as an investment location, with the number of new investments secured in 2002 up by two thirds on 2001. At the same time, its  measures to promote more high value activities by overseas companies in Ireland are bearing fruit, with companies undertaking in 2002 to invest nearly €120 million in research and development activities in their Irish operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development are continuing to work closely with indigenous companies as they seek to minimise the negative impact of a difficult international trading environment. As well as working with existing client companies in improving their competitiveness and in developing their exports, a range of initiatives are being put in place geared towards Irish companies developing export markets for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">In the current global climate of major geo-political uncertainty, the Government will continue its work of addressing the factors necessary to maintain Ireland's competitive position.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_113">I am intrigued that the initial figures given by the Minister vary somewhat from the figures given in answer to a similar question a month or two ago. One would think the historical answers would be firm.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The question focused on the impact of changing circumstances on current employment, not on the Minister's efforts to bring in further jobs which we can analyse in a separate question. Is there a separate unit within the Department for companies at risk? Is there a constant analysis of vulnerable companies?</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Is the Minister aware that small and medium sized industries across the country are highly marginal and feel isolated and vulnerable? What specific steps has she taken to deal with the changed economic circumstances, where the trends before the advent of war were that redundancies are up by more than 6% in the first two months of this year and where for five consecutive months there has been a decline in industrial output? With that in mind, what support mechanisms has she put in place to protect existing employment and give succour, support and practical help to companies who are marginal?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_116">I do not know why the figures would be different. I will check that. Clearly they should be the same. I hope it is not an error but I will clarify that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is one of the most globalised economies. According to a recent survey, it is the most globalised economy in the world, with 60% of our jobs dependent on our performance in export markets. We trade about 160% of our GDP. In that context, it is obvious that conditions overseas to a large extent determine the success or failure of Irish companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">We do not have a specific set of measures to help companies in trouble because the kind of difficulties vary from one company to another, but within Enterprise Ireland there are a range of supports available for companies to up-skill their work forces, to invest in new technology and to  engage in market diversification for research and development, all focused on making companies more sustainable and more competitively effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">There is an early-warning unit in the Department, which seeks to keep an eye on companies that are in difficulties. These tend to be in certain sectors and all of us know the sectors that find themselves in difficulties from time to time. Any company involved in basic manufacturing will clearly have difficulties operating out of an economy such as ours – not in all cases, but generally. That is why a huge focus of our industrial strategy in recent times has been on encouraging companies to introduce new value-added activities, investing in innovation and research and development and raising the skills level of work forces. That strategy is paying dividends. Only last night, I met 72 buyers who had come here from central and eastern European countries as part of Enterprise Ireland's strategy of diversifying our trade into new world markets. That will be an important element in helping small Irish companies to pool with companies overseas and perhaps to out-source some of their activities with a view to keeping the higher-value end of their businesses in Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_61">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_120">Would the Minister accept that it is equally important, if not more important, to sustain existing employment as to win new jobs for Ireland? Bearing this in mind, would it not be desirable to create a one-stop shop for vulnerable companies within her Department to co-ordinate support mechanisms, even if it is only to provide information?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_121">Yes, it is more important to sustain existing employment. As they say, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It is clearly easier to work with existing investors than to try to find new ones. That is done on the indigenous side by Enterprise Ireland and on the overseas side by the IDA. Within my Department, the industrial policy unit is constantly keeping a brief on upcoming trends with a view to warning Government if any decisions would be likely to affect the competitiveness of any sector.</p>

       her views on whether the economic environment for the Irish business manager is currently one of inflation running at 5%, interest rates at 2.5%, pay rises at 7% with public sector benchmarking to come, astronomical insurance costs, poor physical infrastructure, weak and exorbitant electronic infrastructure and problems with housing, transportation and health care and her further views on whether the economy is best placed to put the need for increased competitiveness as the central theme of the forthcoming European Union presidency due to these circumstances.

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_123">Ireland's international competitiveness has contributed in large part to our recent economic success. Now that we are facing a more uncertain and challenging time in the international economy it is all the more important to focus on competitiveness. For this reason it has been my objective to place competitiveness at the core of the new national agreement and this is now reflected in the agreed framework document. The partnership programme, Sustaining Progress, states that "renewing competitiveness both within the domestic economy and on the international stage is central to the overall macroeconomic policy of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth and high levels of employment".</p>
          <p eId="para_124">We have recently seen some deterioration in key competitiveness dimensions at domestic level. The annual competitiveness report produced by the National Competitiveness Council, while confirming many of Ireland's strengths, has highlighted the many challenges we face and the difficult choices we have to make as we face an uncertain economic environment. Renewing competitiveness requires a number of actions and we are committed to taking those actions, as I have said on a number of occasions in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">We are taking steps to strengthen competition across the economy and to implement specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance. We are continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as roads and broadband telecommunications. Of critical importance for our future is our increasing investment in research and development and innovation, which will provide the basis for future productivity growth. Sustaining our competitiveness and taking specific actions in areas of weakness is central to overcoming many of the current difficulties faced by the Irish economy and will be the key to placing Ireland in a position to take advantage of any global economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">At EU level, competitiveness is of no less concern. A strong, competitive EU economy is also good for Irish business. Strengthening competitiveness at EU level requires improving the framework conditions for enterprise so that business can play a full role in seizing new opportunities and creating jobs and wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"><i>Additional information</i>There is a real concern that the EU is losing competitiveness in the global economy, which is hindering progress towards the Lisbon goal for 2010. At the summit in Brussels last Friday, the heads of state and government did not lose sight of the Lisbon goal despite international preoccupations. The EU Competitiveness Council, which I will chair during our Presidency, will play a central role in delivering on these challenges.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I am not sure whether the  rest of the reply will provide an answer to the first part of my question, in which I asked the Minister whether she thought the economy could be characterised as having inflation of 5%, interest rates at 2.5%, a pay rise of 7% and so on. The reason I put that in is that it was a direct quote from Dr. Chris Horn, the new chairman of the IMI. The business community is telling the Government about the real problems in this economy for business people and the Minister should be concerned. Deputy Howlin is exactly right – we are facing an acute crisis and the possible loss of tens of thousands of jobs because of our lack of competitiveness. These problems are not solely due to external circumstances, although the Minister has said that conditions overseas determine the success of the Irish economy.</p>

The tax system is part of it and infrastructure also has a key part to play in maintaining and, it is to be hoped, raising competitiveness. Clearly, higher skill levels in the work force and investment in education are also important because we are becoming a much more knowledge-based economy, requiring a higher level of skill and investment in research and development.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_145">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000. There were 24,991 participants in CE at the end of 2002  and this number will reduce to a projected participation rate of 20,000 by the end of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">FÁS prioritises CE projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and co-ordinates reductions in CE places to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of the programme. Activities of the Drugs Task Force and child care service provision are ring-fenced against any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. Community employment places in the health sector, which includes the personal assistant service, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The Government is very much aware of the important contribution community employment has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context, a cross-departmental group of senior officials has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF-mandated review of active labour market programmes is being advanced under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of community employment and the job initiative programme, which should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.</p>

Does he agree that a scheme that is giving good value should not be cut back by 12,000 as the Minister has done in the past two years? Does he agree that at a time when unemployment has grown by 32,000 in the past two years, to cut back CE by 12,000 is making the options for unemployed people worse? Will the Minister of State consider changing policy on this issue and restoring CE as it is a good value, worthwhile scheme that has a positive impact on unemployment?</p>

          <p eId="para_149">CE was introduced as a labour market tool to deal with long-term unemployment. It also gave people the opportunity of training in employment in order to progress into full-time employment. As a result of that development, almost on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, a significant range of community services were carried out under CE and those services provide good value for money for the communities involved. Some community  employment schemes provide much better value for money than others.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">In view of the reduction in the levels of the long-term unemployed, it is appropriate to review CE and reduce the numbers. We no longer have so many people unemployed and have granted 40,000 work permits. A review is being undertaken. The Minister and I are anxious to put on a firm structured footing the community service provision which has become part of CE and which happened almost on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. That is central to the review we are carrying out. We are confident that with 20,000 people we can provide significant community services. We are also confident we can make CE more effective and better value for money than it has been in the past. All of that is under review, which should carry out a critical analytical examination of the whole programme.</p>

Would he not agree that 1,000 flowers have bloomed all over the country as a result of this scheme? However, the Minister of State is telling us this developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as if this was something bad; this was something good. This is a worthwhile scheme which gave real opportunities to people and resulted in 40% placement in employment. It is needed at a time when unemployment is rising to 169,000, according to the live register, an increase of 32,000. In anyone's language now is a time when we need schemes like this.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">While my Department provides FÁS with an annual allocation to fund the social economy programme, the regional breakdown of this funding and the approval of funding for individual social economy enterprises are day-to-day operational matters for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act 1987.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Allocations for the programme have increased from €6.62 million in 2001, to €20.55 million in 2002 and stand at more than €30 million in 2003. Notwithstanding the considerable pressures this year on current Government expenditure, the allocation to the social economy programme was increased by 50%. This increased allocation to FÁS will enable it to meet commitments under the programme. However, as a result of the extraordinary demand for the programme, this substantially increased allocation is not sufficient to meet all the demands from sponsors for new projects. FÁS is currently meeting promoters of approved projects to agree an appropriate timeframe for releasing funds.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I agree the allocation has increased which is welcome. To re-echo the words of Deputy Bruton, does the Minister of State not agree it makes good sense both socially and economically to fund social economy projects that meet the real needs of people on the ground? An example is the WEE project in north Leitrim which was ready to upgrade the homes of elderly and disabled people. If a cost benefit analysis were to be carried out, would the Minister of State not agree that it would save money in the short and long terms?</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Is the Minister of State aware of the high dependency rates, historically and currently, in the north-west on labour market interventions such as CE and the social economy scheme? While he talked about unemployment, the rate of under-employment contributes significantly to that. How does it make sense that the same constraints should apply in the north-west in areas such as Sligo and Leitrim as in other parts of the country that are not dependent to the same extent on CE and the social economy scheme?</p>

The Department wrote to FÁS on 20 August advising it not to give formal approval to projects which would result in firm financial commitments in 2003 over and above those already committed. FÁS has since confirmed those commitments will be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">While any suggestion of a regional imbalance would be a matter for FÁS, under the current review we are looking at areas of the country that have more significant unemployment problems, such as Sligo and Leitrim, with a view to trying to give further assistance through the various schemes that are in operation. From travelling throughout the country and meeting representatives of FÁS and sponsors of schemes, it is evident that there is considerable room for improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of those schemes. There is considerable room for improvement in the output of schemes. This is now under review and when that review is completed I am confident we will have more effective schemes doing better work than has been the case up to now.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">The area of corporate manslaughter is complex. The Law Reform Commission has carried out some legal research on the subject and expects to publish a consultation paper later this year. The paper will review the current law and consider whether a new corporate offence should be introduced or whether the existing law should be extended to take account, in either case, of corporate practice and intent. It would be pre-emptive to introduce legislation with a provision on corporate manslaughter prior to the availability of this consultation paper.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">Speaking to the annual conference of the Health and Safety Authority on 12 March, the Minister of State said: "Since I became Minister with responsibility for workplace health and safety, I have borne witness to more tragic cases than in my entire life as a public representative."  That being the case, is it not incumbent on him to act? Does he accept that corporate manslaughter is a crime in many EU countries and does he consider it appropriate that it is not a crime here? Does he find the number of deaths occurring in industry, particularly on building  sites, to be of such a scale that it demands an immediate response from Government?</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_187">Yes, it demands an immediate response from Government and the response is currently being made. It does not necessarily follow that the introduction of an offence of corporate manslaughter would cure the ills of the industry – it is a complex area. I have undertaken to examine the whole question and have done this to a significant degree. Given that the Law Reform Commission has carried out quite an amount of research, it would be appropriate to await the consultation paper it will produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The examination I have made of practice worldwide shows it is not successful in other countries. Under current legislation in Britain, the prosecution can only succeed if the controlling mind of a company is identified and that person is found to be guilty of manslaughter. There have been few successful corporate manslaughter prosecutions in Britain.</p>

Even if there are few prosecutions, it underscores the view of the Oireachtas that safety standards are unacceptable. Is the Minister of State satisfied, and will he give an assurance to the House, that a sufficient number of inspectors are currently in place to ensure existing law, inadequate as it is, is properly maintained on every building site in the land?</p>

          <p eId="para_229">I will not refer to the Kyoto Protocol, as that is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Following a 60 day consultation with EU industry late last year, during which firms formally applied to have products removed from the retaliation list, a new revised version of the list was prepared by the EU Commission for agreement and finalisation by member states. Overall, we are pleased with the outcome of this consultation process, except in the case of one firm in respect of one low value imported product. All other products imported from the US by Irish firms, of which the Department was notified, were removed from the original list. The final version of the list is expected to be agreed by member states at an EU trade policy meeting in Brussels next Friday. Irish concerns have been fully catered for and, therefore, on the assumption that the one remaining product will be removed, no Irish company will import products on the final version of the EC retaliation product list.</p>

Will the Minister of State comment on an article written by Senator Maurice Hayes in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> in which he suggested Ireland might have a role in bringing together the EU and the US to heal these rifts? I published a document which seeks the creation of a transatlantic foundation in Dublin to bring about such healing. Will the Minister of State or the Minister consider examining the Fine Gael proposal and taking a pro-active role to establish what can be done to improve understanding between the EU and the US so that contentious issues can be addressed and both can have a better understanding of each  other's position as good neighbours and friendly organisations?</p>

A Progressive Democrats source stated the dial in regard to transfer pricing in corporate tax arrangements could be turned up and down and it was possible for the transfer pricing arrangement to be changed if Ireland did not back the use of Shannon Airport by the US. Has the US Administration indicated that it would review the transfer pricing and corporate tax regime between Ireland and the US?

I hope negotiations will continue so that the problems will be sorted out without the need for the implementation of retaliatory measures.

          <p eId="para_243">In preparation for the recent spring European Council meeting, the Taoiseach and his Dutch counterpart, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, submitted a joint letter to the current President in Office of the European Union, Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis of Greece, seeking urgent progress in the removal of remaining barriers to trade in the services sector. Despite a decade of the internal market, barriers to trade in services remain. The joint letter requested the Commission to speed up the implementation of its "Internal Market Strategy for Services" and to submit proposals for legislation to eliminate the remaining barriers to trade in services before the end of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The "Internal Market Strategy for Services" was launched by the Commission in December 2000 and is aimed at making the internal market more effective by ensuring that service providers can operate as easily throughout the EU as they can in their own member state. The internal market has provided major advantages for the business sector and consumers. There has been improved competition leading to lower prices and increases in trade between our nations as the internal market celebrates its 10th anniversary.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">However, the internal market for services is still often subject to complex rules at national or even regional level. These rules can act as a barrier to trade, especially for SMEs, curbing competition and increasing costs. Consequently, European business and consumers are still losing out by not benefiting from wider choice and better and cheaper services. It is easier for many exporters of services to do business outside the EU rather than within, despite a decade of the internal market and the introduction of the euro. The experience of Irish business supports this view.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">My Department is aware of trading difficulties encountered by Irish service firms in the EU. Early in 2002, my Department convened a workshop for Irish service firms and their representative organisations. Representatives from the European Commission directorates general for the internal market and enterprise were invited to the workshop to "hear at first hand" the experiences of these companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">That is if we can get an answer. This is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"><i>Additional information</i>A better functioning internal market for services should help eliminate the obstacles faced by service providers and improve the opportunity for growth in this area. Removing these barriers to trade will increase competition, speed up economic growth and create jobs. The service sector accounts for 70% of GDP and employment in most member states. Consequently, the sector will be a key factor in economic growth in the future. EU enlargement also increases the need to step up the measures to eliminate barriers and to prevent the creation of new barriers.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Last Friday, at the spring European Council in Brussels, the Council agreed that a dynamic and well functioning internal market is essential for productivity and growth and even more so in an enlarged Union. In addition to calling on the Commission to complete work on its services strategy and to bring forward proposals by the end of 2003 the European Council also called on member states to step up their own efforts to dismantle existing barriers.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">Does the Minister accept the completion of the internal market has been good for employment but not necessarily for workers' rights in all instances? The remaining barriers, according to the Taoiseach's website, included the requirement to vet the private security sector within the member state in which they operate. Is that not good in the current climate? Another barrier is the requirement to pay social security contributions in a member state where, for example, a construction worker is employed to ensure his social security benefits are fully realised and secure. In her push to ensure all services are freely traded within the Union, will the Minister give an assurance to the House that equal regard will be paid to the protection of workers' rights, particularly those involved in agency work, to ensure the rights afforded in one member state will not be diminished if they are employed in a different member state?</p>

          <p eId="para_256">I agree that workers' rights should not be adversely affected by virtue of the fact that some one wants to do service sector business in other member states, neither is this a justification for the remaining barriers. These barriers to trade are there to protect companies in certain member states. Sometimes, worthy considerations such as the environment are cited as barriers to trade even though they are not the real reasons. Ireland, together with other countries, wants to see the internal market in the services sector completed as quickly as possible.</p>

There are disputes from time to time in relation to some 2% to 4%.</p>

However, the main direct costs will relate to the cost to the State of hosting a gala dinner for summit participants and security costs outside the summit venue. We estimate the dinner might cost in the region of €50,000.</p>

I am happy with normal, peaceful protest as part of our democratic system but there is a group of international anarchists which travels from one country to another, whose sole objective is to create mayhem.

Does the Tánaiste agree that the policies she and her Government avow, concentrating on competitiveness, symbolise the Washington consensus approach to economic development, which is the focal point of criticism at so many of these demonstrations? Does she agree that the Taoiseach was perhaps correct at the weekend when he said at the world summit that he was suspicious of the single application of something like the Washington consensus on economic matters?

          <p eId="para_275">The world is witnessing what is potentially one of the most catastrophic wars for some time. Given the history of involvement of this country in humanitarian issues, did the Taoiseach raise the importance of urgent humanitarian relief for the citizens of beleaguered towns and cities in Iraq at the summit meeting last week? Can he confirm that aid given by the European Union will be in addition to existing programmes, rather than diverted from existing programmes in Africa or elsewhere?</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Will the Taoiseach outline what arrangements have been made to protect Irish aid workers who wish to work with the various agencies in Iraq? According to the Taoiseach, we are not part of this war. In that context, will Ireland take a real lead in terms of Irish and EU-sponsored humanitarian relief, given that President Bush today sought sanction from Congress for $63 billion in military aid, $8 billion for humanitarian relief and $4 billion for other safeguard measures? It is important that Ireland contributes as it has always done. Will the Taoiseach spell out the implications of the €5 million announced by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_162">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_277">The Thursday night session of the summit issued a statement agreeing to fully support the United Nations' humanitarian effort. As the Deputy knows, the UN has – in recent months and particularly since the start of the year – operated in the hope there would not be a war. However, it did not adopt an irresponsible line – it made an assessment of the resources that would be necessary and built up significant stocks of these in a number of neighbouring regions from which they could be moved into Iraq. The UN will continue to play this role. The European Union gave its commitment to this in the resolution agreed last Thursday night, which is part of the conclusions of the summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Now that we are in this situation, all our efforts, thoughts and work must be towards trying to help the civilian population. We have already allocated resources to the mainline agencies. GOAL personnel are already in Basra and we  must assist them in whatever way we can. We have made additional resources available. The situation will have to be monitored closely. The Red Cross is providing essential services to the vulnerable population in Iraq in extremely dangerous circumstances. UN workers will do all they can to assist in that but that does not remove the dangers. It is a dangerous operation for aid workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met the NGOs today to discuss the humanitarian situation. He has made a statement on it and there is no need to add to that. He has made the resources available. There is agreement within the United Nations to work closely with the NGOs. We will keep in touch through our officials in the UN and give every assistance we can with regard to the issue of protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">That does not deal with the entire situation. There are many difficulties, crises and uncertainties about some of the aspects but all the people involved, such as UN officials and staff, Red Cross staff, NGO staff and the GOAL organisation, are doing their best in this situation. We will continue to assist them.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">UNICEF has warned that 100,000 children in the city of Basra are now at risk of dying from dehydration. It has also warned of serious consequences for hundreds of thousands of other children. How many Irish citizens are in Iraq at present and have there been attempts to contact them through the Department of Foreign Affairs? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the European aid will be in addition to existing programmes and will not be diverted from other programmes?</p>
          <p eId="para_282">My party accepted the decision of the House last week in regard to the issues that confronted us then. I offer the Taoiseach my party's support in taking a vigorous approach in leading Irish and EU sponsored humanitarian aid programmes. This country has had a huge reputation in this area for generations. The Taoiseach will have our support in taking a proactive and vigorous approach to ensuring that our aid gets into Iraq and is directed where it will give the most benefit to those who need it in this unfolding catastrophe.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">I appreciate the Deputy's remarks. The UN, even though it was working for many months to avoid war, made a detailed and careful assessment of what the conflict would cost in terms of problems such as population movements and lack of water supply – much of the water supply in Basra is gone. It has already moved through the Red Cross to bring in generators to deal with that problem. It moved quickly and is endeavouring to do that in a host of areas which are listed in a briefing note I was given by UN officials today.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I am anxious that we stay consistent in this situation so we will work through the UN system in doing everything we can to support the urgent task of humanitarian relief. Kofi Annan and the  EU are dedicated to working together to resolve this. Whatever other differences exist, and there are differences, there are no differences on the humanitarian issue. There is an opportunity, as the Deputy said, for everybody to work together on this. We are glad to play our part and I will keep the House informed of what is happening in that regard.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_285">Has the Government had contact with the United States Government since the conflict began? President Bush said that 30 countries are supporting the coalition of the willing and 15 countries are also supportive and providing overflight facilities and so forth but do not want to go public. Will the Taoiseach clarify whether Ireland is included in that <i>in pectore</i> list of 15? With regard to the Taoiseach's earlier position that a second UN resolution was imperative, what will be the position of the Irish Government if Russia proceeds, as it has stated, with requiring the United Nations to rule on the legality of the war?</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Is the Taoiseach aware of President Bush's announcement a few minutes ago that he will go to Congress to seek $74.7 billion to prosecute the war, on the assumption that it will last for 30 days? A total of $500 million of that sum will go towards humanitarian aid and $1.7 billion will go towards the reconstruction of Iraq. Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is an obscenity that $75 billion will be used to destroy Iraq and $2.2 billion will be spent on reconstruction and humanitarian aid? In light of the withdrawal by Kofi Annan of the non-Iraqi UN personnel dealing with UNICEF, who will manage the programme in the absence of the normal structures? How will it be structured? Will the delivery of aid be compromised? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that it will not be compromised by the military involvement?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_166">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I have had no contact with the American Administration since the war started. I have had no contact with the American embassy either. The Government has made it clear that it is not supporting any state in this crisis. We have consistently supported the Security Council, as Ireland is obliged to by virtue of its membership of the United Nations. Ireland strongly supports, and will continue to support, the system of collective international security, with the UN Security Council exercising primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">With regard to the legal position, the members of the Security Council were unable to agree on the best course of action to achieve the objective set out in Resolution 1441. The legal position will remain uncertain. If Russia seeks a determination, we will not know the position until that determination is made by a court of justice or the UN. Ambiguity about it will continue until then. That has been the difficulty since 8 November last. The argument was about who would determine whether the resolution had been satisfied.  Should it be the UN or individual countries on the basis of earlier resolutions? That will remain the dilemma.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Our efforts will be, as they have been for some weeks, made through the UN officials working on the humanitarian issue. We will do everything we can to assist. The only NGO organisation in Basra – I am open to correction – is GOAL.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">GOAL is certainly there. I understand that the UN has already agreed to operate through GOAL and resources and efforts will be directed through its personnel. The Minister of State met the other organisations today. There are other organisations in the region, as well as UN officials. They have already, through the Red Cross, sent in significant amounts of food and clothing as well as heavy duty equipment to try to get the water supply working again. All our efforts will be directed to helping under the auspices of the UN. The EU money is going into that too. In reply to Deputy Kenny's question earlier, they are additional resources. We will continue every hour of the day to assist that effort through our UN personnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">Will the Taoiseach expressly say whether Ireland is on the list of 15 that the Americans think are supporting them? That is a perfectly clear question to which I would appreciate an answer. What does the Taoiseach know about the availability of food and medical supplies and from where will they be distributed? What is the structure of the relief operation? Will the Taoiseach be more explicit about what the Government's influence is as regards delivering the humanitarian relief programme? Does he recall that after the 1991 Gulf war, the cost of reconstruction was $200 million? The cost of reconstruction built into President Bush's figures is now $1.7 billion. If the Government intends to announce the provision of €5 million towards humanitarian relief, it will be entirely inconsequential given the scale of this disaster which is affecting so many innocent civilians, including children.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Are there any circumstances in which the Government would consider it necessary to withdraw the facilities at Shannon Airport that are being made available for this incredible catastrophe that will affect so many innocent civilians?</p>

          <p eId="para_294">The agencies working through the United Nations include GOAL, Concern and Trócaire as well as the UNHCR, Unicef, the ICHR and the World Food Programme. Ireland Aid is co-ordinating the effort through those agencies. In addition to the €5 million announced today, through Ireland Aid we have also committed €6.8 million to the UNHCR and €8 million to Unicef. Additional money has been earmarked for global relief operations and although it has not yet been allocated, it is available. Both last  week and today, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, stated that he will be closely involved in monitoring the work of the relief organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">We have paid our contribution to the United Nations this year, although many other states have not done so. However, additional funding from the EU and the UN will continue to be used for relief operations. The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has wisely put a large humanitarian relief structure in place following a full assessment of the aid requirements.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_322">The humanitarian issue is the reason it is important to pose the questions we are raising. Would the Taoiseach care to correct his statement that the Government does not support any state in this conflict? The Tánaiste was quite clear in saying that we were supporting the United States –"our friends", as she put it. That was very clear to everybody. Would the Taoiseach agree that many eminent people regard Ireland as supporting and participating in the coalition of the willing? Dr. John Pike, the head of the Global Security think-tank in Washington is under no illusion that Ireland is a member of the coalition of the willing. Dr. Niall Gardner of the Heritage Foundation Institute in Washington was quoted over the weekend as saying, "I would certainly include Ireland as a member of the coalition. By opening Shannon it is definitely offering support". Robert Fisk certainly feels the same, writing from Baghdad in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent.</i> In that case, does the Taoiseach accept that these people are basing their views on information he does not have, or are they wrong to disagree with him?</p>
          <p eId="para_323">According to the latest news reports, the American President is seeking $75 billion for extra military operations, not just in Iraq but in Afghanistan and other countries as part of the war on terror. Will the Taoiseach be a member of that coalition, whether it is called a coalition of the willing, of friends, of support or of facilitation? Whatever he might call it, will the Taoiseach continue to be a member of that, regardless of how many Iraqi civilian casualties mount up in  the coming days, weeks and perhaps months? Is there any caveat set down by the Government to say that this has gone too far in terms of legality and the price of human suffering?</p>

          <p eId="para_324">Everybody in this House, and the vast majority of Irish people, would like to have seen this matter being resolved without conflict. They certainly did not want to see war – no one wanted that. It is sad and disturbing for everybody that, 12 years on, this matter could not have been resolved diplomatically. It is unfortunate that four months after UN Resolution 1441 it has not been possible to resolve it by obtaining Iraqi compliance through the United Nations in order to avoid this catastrophe. That did not happen but this country has stuck firmly to its position that we wanted it dealt with under the United Nations. Agreement was not reached on that point, however, and we are not participating in the conflict. We cannot participate in it and will not be doing so. The only coalition towards which we now have to turn our attention is the United Nations humanitarian aid effort. We will do everything we can through our agencies to assist in resolving that problem.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_325">The Taoiseach has not answered the question. He says we are not participating but I think that matter will be resolved in court. Given his definition of support, can the Taoiseach say that we are supporting the US attacks on Iraq through facilitating refuelling and landing at Shannon Airport? Will the Government be pro-active in the humanitarian effort, given that the Taoiseach has been a part of creating the crisis? Will he push for and facilitate a recall of the United Nations General Assembly? UNHCR funding is $25 million, even though it needs $60 million for the coming month for work by UNICEF and the UN environment programme. In addition, the UN chief weapons inspector, Dr. Hans Blix, is on stand-by with his inspectors. The UN General Assembly needs to be recalled to offer some level of constructive humanitarian assistance in the crisis that has been created. Will the Government be pro-active in getting that humanitarian crisis addressed?</p>

Therefore, it is bizarre that it is being redrawn and rowed back.

          <p eId="para_377">For a Second Stage debate, the time allocated is quite lengthy in that more than 11 hours are being allocated for the debate in the House this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I have said this many times, but I will say it again in reply to the Deputies, the FOI Act established new legal rights five years ago to enable each person to access information held by public offices. The Government extended such access by the establishment of an enormous amount of agencies over the past five years, with up to 370 agencies of State now covered in this regard. We have established the right of each person to have official personal information amended where it is incomplete, incorrect or misleading and to obtain reasons for decisions affecting him or her. None of those rights has been changed in the legislation. I can only conclude that those Members who have stood up in the House give the impression they have not bothered to look at the changes. I can come to no other conclusion.</p>

        <heading>European Council Meeting: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_330">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_484">I attended the European Council in Brussels on 20 and 21 March last. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State for European affairs, Deputy Roche. The conclusions agreed by the European Council have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The meeting was productive. We built on the work of the past three years of economic reform and re-committed all member states to achieving the European Union's ambitious ten-year Lisbon agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The developments relating to Iraq are currently dominating the world agenda. In light of global political tensions, the European Council focused its attention on the issue of Iraq during  the Council. I will be returning to this issue later in my statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">We were all agreed that it is at such times as this that the economic and social reforms agreed at Lisbon in 2000 become vital. The current economic downturn makes it more essential to increase the capacities of our economies to grow and prosper. Moreover, an ability to tackle our common economic challenges together will buttress the public's confidence in the European Union's ability to act decisively and in a united fashion. This confidence has been shaken by the divisions within the EU on Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">In advance, I wrote to Prime Minister Simitis outlining Ireland's priorities for the European Council. These included employment, regulatory reform, research and development, social cohesion and sustainable development. I also issued a joint letter and paper with Prime Minister Balkenende of the Netherlands, seeking greater action throughout Europe in relation to the internal market for commercial services. Furthermore, in a joint letter with Prime Minister Persson of Sweden I underlined the role and value of the SME sector in contributing to sustainable economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The Council meeting commenced with an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox. Unfortunately, pressing parliamentary business at home prevented me from attending this part of the Council. I understand that Mr. Cox, with whom I had a brief meeting, confirmed that the European Parliament is fully playing its part in the Lisbon reform agenda. In particular, the Parliament remains on track in its legislative contribution and has pushed forward its own reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The Lisbon agenda is not about making dramatic breakthroughs at European Council meetings. We are now into the fourth year of what is a ten-year project. The Lisbon agenda is the framework within which we in Ireland and European Union citizens everywhere will ensure our future prosperity and achieve a sustainable and fair quality of life for all. These are the bread and butter issues of the European Union. They are important for every citizen and every community here in Ireland and throughout the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">We reviewed progress on the Lisbon agenda, discussed the key issues and set priorities for future work. Since we agreed the Lisbon agenda three years ago, we have made significant progress. Five million new jobs have been created in the EU. Unemployment has also declined by two million. Other areas in which we have obtained results include opening up energy markets, creating a single European sky, putting in place an integrated Europe-wide financial market, agreeing a community patent and an agreement on the taxation of energy. However, the European Council recognised that much more still needs to be done. European leaders have renewed their commitment to pursue sound macro-economic policies to restore confidence and economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">This year provides an opportunity to use the streamlined policy co-ordination instruments – the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines and the internal market strategy – and give them a new three-year perspective. By synchronising these instruments the European Council will be in a better position to review and adjust its policies as a whole. Improving the employment position is central to the Lisbon strategy. The new three-year employment guidelines, which are to be endorsed at the June European Council, will provide a basis for a simplified and more effective employment strategy. In addition, the European Council invited the Commission to establish a European employment task force, which will report in time for the 2004 spring European Council. I am confident this task force will give added momentum to the employment strategy by rapidly identifying practical measures to increase the European Union's employment levels. I welcome the nomination of Mr. Wim Kok to head this task force. I have known Wim, both as Minister and Prime Minister, for many years and I look forward to working with him again.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">We agreed that competitiveness must once again be placed centre stage. In particular, we highlighted the horizontal role of the new Competitiveness Council in enhancing competitiveness and growth in an integrated way across all of its strands. The Council's work will complement the work done by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council to ensure that we deliver economic reform. The European Council meeting was also important for people engaged in small business, the backbone of our economic activity. In this context we invited the Commission to present a European entrepreneurship action plan before the 2004 spring European Council. This will pay special attention to making new business start-ups quicker and easier, as well as facilitating access to low-cost finance. One of the areas in which we called for special attention was that of regulatory reform. We need to reduce administrative burdens, have better consultation procedures and simplify existing regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">On the social agenda, the European Council underlined the importance of solidarity and social cohesion. We reiterated the importance of the interaction between employment, good economic performance, education and social protection policies. We welcomed the joint Council-Commission reports presented on pensions and on health care and care for the elderly. We called on member states to ensure the implementation of further reforms of pension systems, including increasing employment opportunities for older people. The European Council also invited member states, in their new national action plans for social inclusion – to be presented by July next – to set appropriate national targets for significantly reducing the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In the research and development area, we stressed that the momentum behind the Euro pean area of research and innovation and the information society must be maintained. The European Council urged member states to take concrete action to promote increased business investment in research and development, moving towards the ambitious objective set at Barcelona last year of approaching 3% of GDP. We also called for organisations to avail of the full potential of the sixth research framework programme. In particular, the participation of SMEs in research and development must be enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The European Council renewed its commitment to stronger cohesion across the Union and its leadership in promoting sustainable development. The European Council invited member states to accelerate progress towards meeting the Kyoto protocol targets, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in the share of renewable energy. It noted the important role of environmental technologies in delivering the twin environmental and competitiveness goals. The Council also considered maritime safety and called for a comprehensive response on maritime safety in the light of the <i>Prestige</i> accident. Unfortunately we were not able to agree a tax package due to difficulties in relation to milk quotas raised by Italy.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The European Council has agreed to meet shortly with President Giscard d'Estaing to discuss the ongoing work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. This meeting is likely to take place in Athens on 16 April next, to coincide with the signing of the treaties of accession. As I signalled at the start of this statement, international developments dominated much of the agenda at this European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">We are now faced with the beginning of military conflict in Iraq. Our shared hope was that the conflict would end with the minimum suffering and loss of human life. Rather than dwelling on the well-known differences of our partners, we agreed on a forward-looking approach. The EU is committed to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political stability of Iraq. We respect the rights of the people of Iraq, including all persons belonging to minorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">We are all agreed that the UN must continue to play a central role during and after the current crisis. We called on the Security Council to give the United Nations a strong mandate, particularly as regards co-ordinating assistance once the conflict in Iraq is over. The European Council has agreed that the EU will be actively involved in addressing the major humanitarian needs that will arise from the conflict. The EU supports UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's proposals to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq. The European Council invites the Commission and EU High Representative Javier Solana to explore the means by which the EU can help the people of Iraq to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity. An Iraq under a representative government, at peace with its neighbours, is our common objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">We also discussed the implications of the current crisis for the Middle East region. The EU  will actively support regional stability. We are calling on all countries in the region to refrain from actions that could lead to further instability. The importance of progress in the Middle East peace process was underlined. We agreed on the importance of the immediate publication and implementation of the Quartet road map, which has been prepared by the UN, the US, the EU and Russia. We reiterated the importance of dialogue and co-operation with the Arab and Islamic worlds to underline that this is not a clash of civilisations. We also agreed on the need to work for a comprehensive multilateral policy to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Ireland has a long tradition and expertise in this area, and we will actively contribute to this work in the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The European Council gave particular attention to the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and adopted conclusions on the matter. There is a consensus among European leaders that the crisis in Iraq makes it more than ever imperative that this long-standing problem be addressed. Europe remains committed to the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security on the basis of the 1967 borders. President Bush has announced that he wishes to see the Quartet road map for a Palestinian state presented to the parties after the confirmation of the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas. This announcement was welcomed by the Council. I understand that the new Palestinian cabinet will be presented to the Palestinian legislative council in about three weeks. Implementation of the road map will not be easy and will require parallel progress in the political, economic and security fields. Israel's policy of illegal settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitute a significant obstacle to peace. The Council emphasised this and called for a reversal of Israeli policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The European Council regretted the failure to reach agreement on a comprehensive settlement on the issue of Cyprus. It supported the continuation of the Secretary General's mission and negotiations on the basis of his proposals. It urged all parties concerned to work for a settlement of the Cyprus problem and in particular called on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to reconsider its position. The Republic of Cyprus will proceed to sign its treaty of accession to the European Union next month. I regret that this will not be with a view to the accession next year of a united Cyprus. The Council also discussed other items on the international agenda, including the western Balkans and Korea.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">To conclude on an economic note, we made significant progress at the European Council in Brussels. The Lisbon agenda touches the lives of European citizens in a real and material way. The outcome of the Brussels Council clearly demonstrates the importance of pressing ahead, both at EU and at national level, with the reforms needed to restore confidence and stability in our economies. Especially at this time, when there is  a clear concern that the process of economic reform in Europe may be losing momentum, it is even more urgent that we press on with the Lisbon goal. The Lisbon agenda will be central to our Presidency of the EU next year. I am determined to work to ensure that the reforms first set out at Lisbon are advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I intend that our own objectives for next year's spring European Council will be drawn from a number of critically important areas – creating and sustaining increased employment, making Europe more competitive, fostering greater social cohesion, making progress on sustainable development and consolidating all of the experience and good practice by member states in applying the Lisbon strategy over the past four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">While the recent divisions within the EU on the issue of Iraq have been most unwelcome, last week's European Council demonstrated that even at times of deep division on a particular issue, the European Union is both able and willing to address the broader agenda. It is at times like this that the real value of the European Union can be seen. The Union provides a space and a structure where national disagreements can be mediated and placed in perspective. It is a stabilising force in Europe and in the world. It is in all our interests that it continues to be successful, as it has been for the past half century.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">The Taoiseach seems to have given a broader report than was reported in most of the media, which reflected on the European summit as being a meeting of glacial quality with people standing around in various corners not talking to each other as a consequence of the Iraqi situation. I was struck by two quotations from some time ago that I came across. When addressing the League of Nations in 1936, Eamon de Valera said:</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Peace is dependent upon the will of great states. All the small states can do is resolutely to determine that they will not become tools of any great power and that they will resist every attempt to force them into a war against their will.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Speaking in this House in 1946, he said, "Small nations have a particular reason for wishing to have security maintained by combined or collective effort."</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We had a stringent debate here last week on the business of Ireland offering facilities to US military aeroplanes passing through en route to the Gulf region. The collapse and failure of the European Union to agree a position on this speak of a failure of diplomacy in one sense. At a different level the fact that the United Nations failed  to get agreement for a second resolution should not mean that the United Nations should become extinct or be cast aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">For the past six to nine months the European Union failed to achieve a common approach to the Iraqi problem. That has now caused a serious crisis within the Union. The current rift between France and Britain is as great as it was for many years, which must be a cause of concern for European leaders. The fact that Germany and France have a division in so far as NATO is concerned also speaks for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">While the Minister for Foreign Affairs speaks of military neutrality and others will argue for political neutrality and the morality of neutrality, as a small country now defenceless, we now find ourselves in a position where for better or worse the United Nations Security Council is split, NATO is divided and Europe fractured. Given our traditional role as a small heretofore neutral country, there should be an emphasis by the Government on trying to put together a common European approach and speaking with a common European voice on the crisis with which we are now faced.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The Security Council and other United Nations structures set up after the Second World War were based upon a world order which was very different. For instance India, an English speaking democracy, with a population of approximately 1.2 billion does not sit on the Security Council, nor does Brazil or South Africa, except on a rota basis. France, as an allied nation in the Second World War, has a permanent place. The issue of these matters needs to be addressed in terms of how Europe views its foreign and security policy and its defence entity. This has become more prominent in recent times with Germany, France and Belgium calling for views on it. For many years Deputy Gay Mitchell has been proposing the concept of a common defence entity in which Ireland would be a vigorous participant in putting it together. This needs to be considered, given where we are today.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Not only should the European Union speak with a single voice in terms of its foreign and defence policy, it should also make a very strong case that the United Nations should have an overseeing role in the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq. This should not be led by an agenda by the United States alone or with one or two other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I am struck by what the Taoiseach said about the quartet and the road map. Although I am not an expert in international law, it appears that 85% or 90% of the problems of Islamic countries seem to stem from the central crisis of the Israeli and Palestinian problem. The view that I get as a political figurehead, if one likes, is that were this to be sorted out, a great percentage of the controversy and difficulty people living in those countries have towards western countries would dissolve. In his capacity as a Head of Government in the European Union the Taoiseach should  press for an analysis to try to bring a solution to this problem that has existed since 1948.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I was happy to hear the Taoiseach's words about the humanitarian effort to be put in by Ireland as part of the European Union. Obviously, there is an unfolding catastrophe in Iraq. I would have preferred if the United Nations had allowed Dr. Blix to complete his report one way or another and then decide on the unanimity or otherwise of another resolution for multilateral action to sort it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The Taoiseach stated the Council also considered maritime safety on which it called for a comprehensive response. The accident involving the <i>Prestige </i>was genuine as was the one involving the <i>Tricolour.</i> Europe should have a really effective maritime approach. If either of those ships had been carrying biological or nuclear weapons for terrorist activities, there would have been the most serious consequences. Given the expanse of sea we have, there should be increased focus on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">There should be a concentration on unifying our political voice within the European Union. The United Nations should not become extinct. Europe should have a very strong voice in ensuring this. It should oversee in a really effective way the political and physical reconstruction if Iraq when the war is over. As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, $68 billion for military funding and $8 billion for humanitarian aid speaks for itself. The idea appears to be to flatten and build it up again. When the Taoiseach meets the leaders next week, he should bring the humanitarian issue right to the top as this is an unfolding catastrophe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I am grateful to Deputy Kenny for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate. I was very struck by the Taoiseach's comment that the president of the Convention would come to a special meeting of the European Council at Athens in April. From the cold handshakes and the distance between participants at the European Council meeting it is clear that considerable patching up needs to be done. There is a long way to go to improve relations, not just within the European Union but also between the European Union's existing states and the applicant states and between some European Union member states and the United States. There is much upset and division as a result of positions taken on Iraq. The European Council meeting was not as productive as previous European Council meetings because of the diversion into this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">From all that has happened it seems the ambitions of the Convention on the Future of Europe to present a draft constitutional treaty for perhaps 50 years – if it was ever a reality – are now dead. In replying to the debate, the Minister might deal with this issue. Further to the point made by Deputy Kenny, if there is to be a constitutional treaty for 30 or 50 years, the question of common defence has to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">In this House we have come to expect that foreign policy is dealt with in a very indifferent way – an <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> way as stated by Deputy Rabbitte, with words meaning whatever the Taoiseach says they mean. We need to be more clear about issues in this House. If we want to see a European Union defence architecture come about which suits our needs and wishes, we should be one of the architects proposing the entity we want. We can bury our heads in the sand, just as we did for the Iraqi war when the House had gone into recess and the Taoiseach indicated his true thoughts in an interview in Washington, or we can try to influence the agenda. If a European Union identity evolves, either on a treaty or other basis, when others will join it will be similar to those who will join EMU – it will be on the basis of rules made by others. It is time this House debated the need for a proper European Union defence entity. I have called for this debate for a long time. I hope the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to speak to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing when he is here in the coming days. I hope Ireland will take the opportunity to put across its views at the European Council meeting in Athens.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I note that part of the Presidency conclusions state, "The UN must continue to play a central role during and after the current crisis."  Can we not admit that the first casualty of this war has not been truth; it has been the United Nations? No matter what the European Council puts into its conclusions, it needs something much stronger than wording such as this to repair the damage done to the collective security afforded by the UN.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The conclusions continue, "We urgently need to address the major humanitarian needs that will arise from the conflict."  I fully agree with this. It was clear long before now that there was going to be a conflict in Iraq. I asked in this House that the European Union put in place a proactive plan to bring humanitarian assistance to Iraq after the departure of Saddam Hussein. A significant part of the EU development aid budget goes unspent. We should now be trying to direct this towards humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The conclusions also state, "We want to effectively contribute to the conditions allowing all Iraqis to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity under a representative government."  I am sure this House would echo this sentiment and I hope to see it come about. It went on to state, "The Council invites the Commission and the High Representative to explore the means by which the EU might help the Iraqi people to achieve these objectives."  Why is this invitation only being issued now? The Americans put their plans for a post-Saddam Iraq in place months ago. They placed advertisements in newspapers to which friends of that Administration were able to reply. The European Union should have been doing this long before now. It should not be left to the European Council to invite the Commission to do this as late as 20 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Another part of the conclusions state the Council, "will continue to work actively towards  the reinvigoration of the Middle East Peace Process."  As Deputy Kenny put it, this is something that needs to gain momentum. I saw the Taoiseach nodding in agreement as Deputy Kenny said this. We hope the Taoiseach and his colleagues will put every effort into ensuring this momentum is gained. I note that 2005 is now being spoken of. While the date is not too far away, it should not be forgotten, irrespective of what happens in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I was taken aback to see the conclusions state, "In the international field, we reiterate our commitment to the fundamental role of the United Nations in the international system and to the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and stability."  What is being reiterated? Is this the Council that has Britain, France and Germany in it? At least Britain made some effort. This looks like fiction emanating from the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The conclusions also talk about common foreign and security policy and European security and defence. I hope the Taoiseach will take account of the need to bring the issues into the open by having a debate on this. While we may agree or disagree, let us have a debate on the need for a common defence within the EU.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_529">Formally, last week's European Council meeting was the third in the series of annual spring summits to discuss progress on the so-called Lisbon agenda – the European Union's ten-year plan for economic and social renewal initiated at Lisbon in March 2000. The express purpose of the plan is to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world. In reality, the formal Council agenda was overshadowed by the US-led war against Iraq and the divisions within the Union in respect of it. The post summit communiqué might suggest otherwise, with its paragraph after paragraph of turgid economic commentary on the Lisbon agenda and passing reference at the end to Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">However, the real issues were Iraq and the division within the Union arising from the war. The focus of the summit was Iraq and there is little point concerning ourselves to any extent with what the Heads of Government had to say about the Lisbon agenda, since little time was spent at the summit itself around these issues. This is not to imply in any way that the Lisbon agenda issues are not important. Indeed it was one of the small tragedies of the current climate that so little time was devoted to issues that will determine all our futures. The issues of growth, prosperity and jobs, social cohesion, innovation and entrepreneurship, are all vital. That there was no time to make any real progress on these areas has its own implications for Europe's short to medium-term future.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">As the Heads of Government gathered last Thursday in Brussels the External Relations Commissioner, Chris Patten, addressing the European Parliament meeting in extraordinary plenary session on Iraq, stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The challenge that we will face in the coming weeks and months, goes far beyond what Winston Churchill once called "the thankless deserts of Mesopotamia."  I think we face a very clear choice in the coming months. Are we to go back to the way the world was run in the 19th century, a world of rival national sovereignties and balances of power, or do we try to rebuild the institutions and habits of global governance which have been so painfully constructed in the last half century? That is the clear choice that is going to face us. I know which side of the argument I come down on.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">In drawing comparison with the 19th century system of imperialism, sovereign rivalry and shifting alliances and dominated by the British Empire, I do not think that Chris Patten, last Governor of Hong Kong, exaggerates the scale of the current crisis. I also know which side of the divide I come down on. Unlike the Government, I am on the same side as Commissioner Patten, the side that supports "the institutions and habits of global governance . . . so painfully constructed in the last half century."</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I do not intend a replay of last week's debate on the war but the war cannot be avoided in this debate and we are, globally and in Europe, in a crisis as a result of this wrong and dangerous war. While physical casualties are already beginning to mount on both sides, before they can be counted there are other casualties. The multilateral global system has been severely damaged as a result of the American-led, so-called preventative war policy. The United Nations has been blocked, a fact which is being gloated over by senior American policy makers. As the President of the Socialist Group on the European Parliament, Enrique Baron, has put it, the Iraqi people are being punished twice, by suffering under Saddam and now risk being killed in an unjust war. Europe is bitterly divided.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">We now live in the shadow of an American Government composed of men intent on world domination, or as these same men put it, "American global leadership", with war at the heart of their foreign policy. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, referred to this issue in the House last week, when he spoke about how policy towards Iraq was developed and I believe it is a subject to which not nearly enough attention has been paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I do not believe the current policy of the American Government is one that has the support of the American people nor do I believe that it represents the majority view of the US political establishment or the American political system. However, it is a policy passionately advocated and pursued by those who, under the presidency of George W. Bush, currently rule America. These people, Dick Cheney, Elliott Abrams, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, have an imperial agenda. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, their talk is of the new American century. They have been advocating this vision of a <i>Pax Americana</i> with passion and conviction for more than a decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The agenda first surfaced in 1992 with the document known as the Defense Planning Guidance, co-authored by Wolfowitz, then an under secretary in the Department of Defence. The agenda goes under various names such as the Wolfowitz Doctrine and the Project for the New American Century. On the one hand this doctrine talks somewhat innocuously of "America's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles."  On the other, however, the advocates talk openly of making the case and rallying "support for American global leadership"; increasing defence spending significantly and challenging "regimes hostile to our interests and values."</p>
          <p eId="para_538">One of their publications, Rebuilding America's Defences: Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century, outlines two of the main objectives they advocate in respect of defence and foreign policy. One is to "fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater wars" and the second is to "perform the ‘constabulary' duties associated with shaping the security environment in critical regions". There is nothing here about commitment to multilateralism, to the UN, to principles of international law, to peace, to "the institutions and habits of global governance" and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">My colleague, Deputy Higgins, in referring to this ominous group, could have also drawn to our attention a letter they wrote in 1998 to then President Bill Clinton. They urged him then to "turn your Administration's attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam's regime from power" and further stated "We believe the US has the authority under existing [1998] UN resolutions to take the necessary steps, including military steps, to protect our vital interests in the Gulf. In any case, American policy cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council."  Could anything be clearer than that letter to President Clinton—</p>

          <p eId="para_541">—or bear out Robin Cook's question that had Al Gore been elected would we be where we are today? These advocates were out of power then and now they are in power and fully implementing their agenda, which is not the agenda of ordinary Americans or most American politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Ironically, however, it is the Tánaiste's agenda. This is the drum that she would have this country unquestioningly follow. She spoke after me in the debate last Thursday and I was quite shocked at her contribution, which was simple and simplistic. She is the one who advocates America, right or wrong, without in any way referring to the clique which controls its foreign policy, has sundered the UN and has set out clearly its objectives. As  somebody in a letter to the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today stated, her position is the rhetoric of the school yard. It is no more complex that that. If the Tánaiste thinks our new position on foreign policy is supposed to be “right or wrong, we follow America” there is little point in us having this kind of debate in the House. The issues are more complex than that and of more interest to small countries, in particular, than simply saying, “America, right or wrong.”</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I refer to Robert Byrd, who is the longest serving member of the US Senate. He made an interesting speech, with which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be familiar. He stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have isolated ourselves. We proclaim a new doctrine of pre-emption which is understood by few and feared by many. We say that the United States has the right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on terrorism. We assert that right without the sanction of any international body. As a result, the world has become a much more dangerous place. We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance. We treat UN Security Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by lifting their heads from the carpet. Valuable alliances are split.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Senator Byrd's voice is, I believe, the true voice of America, although that for the moment, unfortunately, does not matter, as it is the militants of the project for the New American Century who currently hold power. Ordinary Americans and the rest of us are paying a price for this war-making and the world will still be paying a price long after these men are gone from power. It was stated in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> on 19 March that:</p>
          <p eId="para_546">For two centuries, foreign powers have been conquering Mideast lands for their own purposes, promising to uplift Arab societies along the way. But in nearly every incursion from Napoleon's drive into Egypt through Britain's rule of Iraq in the 1920s to Israel's march into Lebanon in 1982, Middle East nations have tempted conquerors only to send them reeling.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">It was clear, even from the television pictures of the summit, how badly Europe is split on these issues. It was thought that the EU had developed at least the beginnings of a framework of common foreign and security policy and that this had been achieved through the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. We now know how fragile is that framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The original vision drawn up in the early 1970s for a common European foreign policy talked of ". . .  a United Europe capable of assuming its responsibilities in the world . . .  making a contribution commensurate with its traditions and its mission."  That seemed to have been brought to  realisation in the language used in the relevant provisions of the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, language such as "member states shall inform and consult one another"; "whenever it deems it necessary, the Council shall define a common position"; "member states shall ensure that their national policies conform to the common positions"; and so on. Britain's behaviour within the councils of the EU shows this language to be, at best, aspirational and, at worst, empty. It may well be that Tony Blair saw himself and Britain acting as a brake on the present US administration's unilateralism and excess. The extent that that is so will probably be a matter for historians to determine.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">What is also a reality is British commitment to Atlanticism and beneath the surface of the European common foreign and security policy project, there is a fundamental tension between Atlanticism on the one hand and the drive for European integration on the other. Time and again this tension has surfaced and so it has now, again. As a result of British Atlanticism to the point even of joining in the US unilateralist policy and "pre-emptive war", the foreign policy provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties lie in ruins and to its shame our Government is a party to that wrecking: so much for the policy of being "good Europeans".</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Europe does not now speak with the single voice it thought it had achieved through the incorporation of the CFSP into the treaties. Europe is divided and speaking with two discordant voices. It is not in the European interest that this dualism persists or that any formulation, aimed at resolving the problem, simply attempts to paper over and hide the cracks. Equally meaningless will be to attempt to pursue such a policy of dualism and to adopt into the constitutional treaty – as is currently proposed – provisions such as the proposed Article 10.5.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Whatever the shape a reconstructed common foreign policy is to have, it will have to deal with the transatlantic relationship. However, the relationship between Europe and the US must be based on mutual respect and cannot be one of the EU as a vassal – the preferred relationship, it would appear, contemplated by the present rulers of the US. A key aspect of the common foreign and security policy must be in global affairs advocacy of and commitment to the multilateralism represented by the United Nations system, including the Security Council, and the rebuilding of the institutions and habits of global governance – to again use the terminology of the EU Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Where do we stand in relation to that objective? In the eyes of Europe, it appears we have made our choice. We will, it seems, be amenable to those who exert the most pressure on us. We had an opportunity in the last couple of weeks to speak and act as genuine multilateralists and as full and equal partners in the European project, yet we chose to turn our backs on that role.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh agus an Teachta Seosaimh Ó hUigín.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The <i>International Herald Tribune</i> said that no-one could remember a European summit more tense and surreal. I was caught up in the intense security operation in Brussels, as I attended a meeting last Friday of Green Party leaders around Europe to agree a declaration on the invasion of Iraq. It is difficult to believe that this war against Iraq is supposed to be making us feel more secure. It is certainly taking its toll on civil liberties and freedom of movement. It is also taking its toll on consciences. When we hear that some 100,000 children are at risk in Basra because of the bombardment from one of our EU partners, it is a surreal experience with which to deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I hope the EU summit's concerns about the humanitarian crisis will be addressed at this moment and not just in a post-war Iraq. The summit was supposed to be dealing with future economic, social and environmental action for the EU, furthering the objectives of the Lisbon strategy. I am pleased to see that the Presidency conclusions make commitments in the environmental area on such issues as accelerating progress towards the Kyoto Protocol targets, promoting renewable energy, setting targets on bio-fuels for transport, restoring bio-diversity and fish stocks and improving maritime safety. It will be interesting to see how many of these targets the Government will meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">We are in the midst of a war which has not only divided the world, but bitterly divided the European Union and raised many doubts about the EU's common foreign and security policy. What messages did the war on Iraq and the disagreements over it bring to the EU and its future direction? A statement was agreed to at the summit, calling for the UN to have a central role once the war ends. We all know one of the reasons there is such division on this war is that the UN's central role in the conflict has been sidelined and usurped by the British and US Governments. There is an obvious hostility towards British and United States bombers decimating a country and those countries then expecting the EU and or the UN to pay for the damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In whose name are they destroying Iraq? Neither the EU nor the UN have backed this destruction. The British Government tried to get agreement from the EU on the running of post-war Iraq but agreement could not be reached because it is obvious that the Bush Administration intends to bypass the United Nations yet again and administer Iraq itself. The French led the objections to any wording that would seem to legitimise, in the EU's eyes, this illegal and immoral war. The EU must ensure it is not used in any way to offer such legitimacy, while helping to alleviate the suffering of victims of war, sanctions and tyranny.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The reaction of the EU has been interesting – the French, Germans and Belgians have now  decided to have a private summit in April to forge closer defence ties. Will the EU now develop a two-tier defence structure or re-inforced co-operation? What will be the outcome of the fact that the fissures in the EU's common foreign and security policy have been shown up so clearly? The Green Party is particularly concerned about the relationship between the EU and the United Nations. The Greens have constantly criticised the evolving EU defence structures, the rapid reaction force, because the EU does not regard the force as requiring a UN mandate. The Government has insisted, in a political-type debate, that, as far as we are concerned, such a force requires a UN mandate. However, as recent events have shown, Ireland has no problem facilitating a military operation that is not UN-mandated. The EU itself, in its aspiring EU defence structures, is undermining and bypassing the UN. We must bear this in mind in the months ahead as the EU considers its new structures and constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Iraq and the Iraqi war have horrified and divided the EU but that does not mean the EU will throw its weight behind the strength in the United Nations. Instead, I fear it will throw its weight behind EU defence structures which will lead to a further diminishing of the United Nations. We plead that the Government is not a party to kicking the United Nations in the teeth once again.</p>

Cuirfidh an tír seo, Málta, leis an ghúth neamspleách frithchogadh san Aontas.

Tá mé ag súil go tacóidh tíortha eile neodracha an Aontais le seasamh na Slóivéine agus Málta.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Is trua nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag seasamh leis na tíortha neodracha sin. Le tamall anuas tá muid ag déanamh athbhreithnithe ar a raibh le rá ag an Rialtas anuraidh i dtaca le conradh Nice – nach raibh baol ann do neodracht an Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I have come to a better appreciation of what the Government was saying during the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. At the time, it felt free to convince the public that there was no danger to our neutrality. In relative terms, I concede that the Treaty of Nice was not a threat to Irish neutrality, because the biggest threat is the Government's policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">While the EU Council may have avoided discussion on the merits and demerits of unilateral attack on Iraq, I do not intend to do so. The  Council and the Government may be comfortable with only discussing the mop-up operation after the war but it is still ongoing. People are dying and the Government has a moral responsibility. It has brought shame on the Irish people because of its support for an illegal war. It should have done the right thing when it was in the chair of the UN Security Council and done more in Europe to ensure there was full co-operation on the position that Germany, France, Belgium and the neutral states took in trying to ensure that there was a diplomatic solution to the crisis based on UN primacy. However, it has not done so, but rather auctioned-off Irish foreign policy to the highest bidder. It has kept its head down and talked for many months out of both sides of its mouth. It gave bogus commitments on neutrality and many other matters, not just to this House but, it appears, throughout the European Union also.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The Government also claims that it is fully committed to the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. On the contrary, however, it proved how willing it was to turn its back on that policy when it stated it would have signed the Vilnius Group letter had it been approached to do so, contrary to the CFSP. Nowhere is the contrast between what it should and is doing more apparent than when one compares its policy on the use of Irish airports and airspace with that of other European neutral countries. Austria, Finland and Sweden said they considered this war to be illegal and in breach of the UN charter and, therefore, invoked their rights and duties as neutral states.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">We have been told which European states are part of the coalition of the willing but there are another 15 which are not named and wish to keep their support secret. I wonder if Ireland is one of those countries and whether the European Council was told of it's exact position. It is time the Government told the House where it stands. It must come clean.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The Council of EU leaders on 20 and 21 March showed itself to be a pathetic and impotent institution, utterly unrepresentative of the majority of the peoples of Europe in relation to the biggest issue facing the world, the US-UK assault on Iraq. As the Council met, the world was witnessing an obscenity of unimaginable dimensions – the richest countries on earth pouring weapons of death and destruction onto one of the poorest peoples.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Even as EU leaders were meeting, the United States Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, was seen on television screens throughout the world revelling in extreme violence and deserving to be labelled for what he is, a criminal psychopath. He promised that we would see US violence at a level never seen before. While a huge majority of ordinary working people in Europe are vehemently opposed to the prosecution of the US-UK invasion of Iraq, the statement following the summit is, incredibly, silent on the substantive  issue. It says the hope of the Council is that the conflict will end with the minimum loss of human life and suffering and that the European Union is committed to respect for the rights of the Iraqi people.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">How could the Taoiseach, the leader of the people, put his signature to that statement, beside those of Blair, Aznar and Berlusconi? They showed what they thought of the rights of the Iraqi people as their schools, streets, homes and bodies of their children were being battered and broken by the bombs dropped by the same Blair, supported by the same Berlusconi and Aznar. How could the Taoiseach even sit in the same room with those carrying out this incredibly violent assault on the people of Iraq? The beastliness of what they have done is now transforming the beastly dictator Saddam Hussein into a hero among the Arab masses.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The Taoiseach, however, probably felt he was on weak ground since he assisted 30,000 of the bombers and killers on their way, through feeding them at Shannon Airport and refuelling their aeroplanes. Most of the Prime Ministers at the summit stated where they stood on the war but the Taoiseach did not. A national daily newspaper quoted how he approached the question of war at the summit: " ‘We are not cross with anybody, we haven't fallen out with anyone,' Mr. Ahern said before he left Brussels yesterday afternoon". Why did the Taoiseach's adviser not tell him that at a summit of EU leaders, with a catastrophic, murderous and criminal war under way that is slaughtering innocent men, women and children, he should not conduct himself as if he was passing around the hat among the cowboys and speculators who cram the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway races?</p>

          <p eId="para_575">It is incredible that the EU summit could only manage some sentiments on the reconstruction of Iraq, the futility of which has been laid bare today. After starving the people of that country of crucial technology and medicines, with devastating consequences for ten years, the Bush regime shows its utter contempt for every human institution by promising half a billion dollars for humanitarian aid, $1.5 billion for reconstruction and $73.5 billion to blast the country to bits and shred and incinerate its people. A sum of $1.5 billion will hardly build two football sta dia, let alone reconstruct a nation of 23 million people.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">To say the millions of people who make up the population of the European Union are ill served by their leadership would be an understatement. Their revulsion at this war has been unrepresented and unexpressed by EU leaders. As anti-war demonstrators have been saying in Ireland and elsewhere, regime change begins at home.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">The work of the Convention has now become practically full time for those who serve on it. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing will arrive in Ireland tomorrow for a few days to conduct business related to the Convention. How does the Minister for Foreign Affairs envisage its role in the future? How does he see it being progressed through the Intergovernmental Conference and into a treaty in the context of the current crisis? What is the impact of the Convention on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The presidential conclusions refer to North Korea. The world now faces three major problems. The first is the war in Iraq which might last much longer than expected. The second is the ongoing war on global terrorism and dealing with al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. The third is, as the conclusions say, that North Korea's non-compliance with its international obligations regarding nuclear weapons is a serious concern for the international community and detrimental to its own interests. What type of analysis or discussions took place at the summit and the Council about North Korea and are there proposals to deal with it?</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The conclusions say the European Union is committed to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political stability of Iraq, its full and effective disarmament in all its territory and respect for the rights of the Iraqi people, including all those belonging to minorities. Has there been a discussion about the political reconstruction of Iraq after all this is over? Given the numbers of Shiites, Kurds and Sunnis there, it might bring about a different regime when the current conflict is over.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_580">In relation to the convention, the President of the Council, Mr. Simitis, reported to the Heads of State and Government, the correspondence he had received from the president of the convention, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, suggesting that when the accession treaties are signed in Athens on 14 and 15 April, one morning of that two-day session should be given over to an attendance by the president of the convention to update the Council on the latest developments. It was to be held in Brussels but that was deferred and it was agreed to hold it in Athens next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">He has also suggested that a special Council be held on 30 June to discuss and finalise the report of the convention. The EU Presidency is consulting with Heads of State and Government as to whether a majority believes it would be appropriate to hold a special Council meeting devoted  to that issue alone, or whether it should be part of the Thessalonika summit due at the end of the Greek Presidency a couple of weeks before that. That discussion is currently going on and the President of the Council will let us know in due course as to what way he wishes to handle that. We expect a period of reflection after the report has been submitted to the Council. We will then move into an Intergovernmental Conference, the duration of which depends upon the presence or absence of consensus on the key issues to be addressed. The convention is still in the throes of all that work so it is too early to say and no decisions have been taken. There is nothing in the conclusions about that aspect of the arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">We are committed to efforts to find a peaceful solution to the situation in North Korea. The spring European Council provided for a special Council session on North Korea. The format has yet to be arranged but it is expected that EU Ministers may be able to exchange views with countries in the region, notably the Republic of Korea and Japan. While a multilateral solution is essential we are aware that regional security issues are also at stake. From our point of view, the issue certainly warrants referral to the Security Council and, therefore, we welcome the decision of the IAEA board of governors to report this issue to the Security Council. We remain keenly aware of the concerns of other countries in the region that no action should be taken which will further aggravate this already serious situation. The Security Council's decision to take up the matter is a continuation of diplomatic efforts but we also support regional efforts to find a solution to the problem, which include North Korea meeting its international obligations, and which might obviate the need for the Security Council to begin taking measures to enforce such commitments. The Security Council's consideration of this issue is still at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">While we all hope the conflict in Iraq will be brought to an end as quickly as possible with the minimum loss of life, the post-conflict situation there is a matter where, clearly, the sovereignty of Iraq has to be respected. Therefore, the question of an alternative government being put in place which would have the support of the people of Iraq is the long-term objective in the aftermath of this particular phase of the military action.</p>

Does the Minister think this has been damaging to our reputation? Would he agree that a common defence, as has been proposed, will increase military  spending? I specifically want to ask the Minister about the declaration that was made about the role that defence research and development have to play in the EU. We have welcomed the EU defence equipment policy, so does the Minister support Ireland becoming part of the arms industry?</p>
          <p eId="para_586">How do we stand in relation to a common European security and defence policy? Does the Minister agree that if we did have such a policy on Iraq, we would have backed the British, Spanish and Italian stance, and that we would not be in the Franco-German camp?</p>

          <p eId="para_600">The Minister's speech referred to the delivery of EU aid for humanitarian assistance but it is entirely unclear as to whether or not it would be willing to allow such assistance to be militarised. The assistance referred to on page five of the  speech mentions co-ordinating assistance, but it does not say whether it is for humanitarian aid or economic reconstruction. Does this mean that economic reconstruction will be mandated by the UN and only by the UN, or does it mean it will be exclusively offered on contract to Vice-President Cheney's former company and others?</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Will the humanitarian assistance delivered by the EU be under the control of the United Nations?

          <p eId="para_602">There is not agreement within the EU membership regarding the question as to whether one characterises the action that is being taken by the UK and the US as being pre-emptive. The Deputy is aware of the line of argument on that. There is not unanimity and therefore it could not form part of the Common Position.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The Taoiseach has indicated in his response that we were not there at the beginning of the meeting. I am given to understand, however, that it was decided by the Presidency to focus on obtaining a Common Position for the future since there clearly is not an agreement at present. There is no point in it pursuing that matter because the argument could still be continuing and the EU would be no further on. One has to respect the Presidency's direction on how the discussion was to proceed. On the understanding that there is not agreement within the EU as to how the current set of circumstances came about, the Presidency confirmed that we should concentrate on what we would do concerning the humanitarian situation, which is outlined in the Common Position. In the circumstances, there is probably some wisdom in that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The question of the long-term implications for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and so on is one presumably to which Ministers and Heads of State will return in due course. In the context of where we are now, it expresses the hope of an end to military action as quickly as possible with the minimum loss of life and the need to advance the humanitarian agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Regarding what Commissioner Patten had to say on the humanitarian question, he is very strongly of the belief that a strong UN mandate should be obtained. Regarding a mandate by the United Nations to be involved in the future reconstruction of Iraq, an emergency reserve fund of somewhere in the region of €100 million was agreed by him last Friday. Clearly, that is only a precursor to further support.</p>

They respect the military neutrality policy we have conducted consistently over the past 50 years and recognise that it is the preserve of the Government to decide on foreign policy issues as I respect their Governments' decisions in their countries. Therefore, there is no question of us having lost any stature with other member states of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Regarding the question of defence and the implications for wider defence issues for the future, this is probably an issue to which we will revert.

          <p eId="para_609">Regarding the question of increased research and development, I advise Deputy Rabbitte that the summit was called for that specific purpose, in that foreign policy issues were dealt with on the first evening of the summit and economic issues and the conclusions adopted for the Lisbon agenda the next. The Lisbon agenda conclusions set out the need to improve innovation and increase research and development. In the high tech sector this probably involves the question of dual use, materials that can have military application. We do not have an armaments industry. We are not going to find ourselves bereft of research and development potential based on the fact that others may use it for other purposes.

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_638">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his assistance in the publication of this Bill which we are keen to see before the House. Its purpose is to provide for the better integration of transport planning as between public and road transport and also to provide for better coherence between our planning and transport policies. That is the central objective and aim of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I will review some key aspects of our expenditure on roads and public transport plans and deal with some of the planning aspects dealt with in the Bill. My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, will speak on the planning issue tomorrow evening. Another colleague, Deputy Boyle, will address some of the financial aspects of our infrastructural expenditure in the transport area.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">As the Bill clearly outlines, the new authority would replace the existing National Roads Authority and the National Rail Procurement Agency. The National Roads Authority needs urgent review. Many Deputies are concerned about the lack of accountability within it. I would be keen to hear from Deputies who have proposed amendments on how it could be improved. The main aspects of the Bill relate to strategic planning of transport and the lack of a strategic policy within the NRA, particularly the lack of strategic connections in the overall transport area. This lack of strategic planning became very clear to me at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport when the current chairman of the NRA, Mr. Michael Tobin said:</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Our function in law has a narrow focus. We are expected to oversee the improvement and maintenance of national roads. That is our sole function.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">That is not good enough. We cannot spend €3 billion per year on national roads without having a more strategic analysis. The only strategic analysis done was undertaken in 1998 when the NRA published the most extensive review of our roads needs in the national roads needs study which set out plans for the following 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The report came out with a firm recommendation that we should improve the intertown sections of the existing primary road network and provide bypasses to remove the worst urban gridlock black spots. The Government acted against this advice on the basis of no known analysis or public discussion. I was involved from an early stage in public consultations. The Government came up with a completely different plan to provide 800 kilometres of new motorways of dual carriageway grade in addition to the existing primary road network. When Mr. Tobin was asked about this he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_644">We made our input but the Government obviously listened to other bodies that had an interest in the matter. I suspect these bodies included IDA Ireland and perhaps the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">It is deeply disturbing that the NRA, which is responsible for the largest capital investment project in the State, was not listened to when it came to the development of the road system. A roads project originally costed at €7 billion is now estimated at approximately €20 billion. This might have been acceptable three or four years ago at the height of the boom when money was no object but we are in a very different financial situation now. We must carry out a fundamental review of the road and transport policies the Government is pursuing. It seems incredible that at a time of great fiscal restraint we are proposing that, with an existing road network that can carry 20,000 passenger cars per day in many instances, we should build an additional road beside that network to carry an additional 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles per day. The only authority with expertise in the area has predicted that in 20 years' time we will not need such capacity. Our roads programme capital budget is two and a half times the capital budget for health and will provide road capacity two and a half times the capacity we actually need in many locations, even if one projects a 220% increase in vehicular traffic over 20 years, which the NRA did for its national roads needs survey. That does not make sense. A review is required, as is a proper structure for carrying out such a review. My argument and that of the Bill is that the NRA will be responsible for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The Government commissioned Fitzpatricks Associates to carry out an economic analysis of the national roads programme. Its work was very good but was hampered by the fact that its terms of reference precluded it from examining issues outside its terms of reference – to address the topics "principally from the programme management and delivery" perspective. Although it looked at some of the socio-economic issues associated with roads, it did not make a strategic analysis as to whether we needed the roads programme the Government came up with.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Other economists and transport experts are not similarly constrained. I find it hard to meet a transport expert who does not agree with the Green Party that the roads programme is out of scale and unnecessary. Writing in the current issue of <i>Irish Banking Review</i> on the public investment programme and the NDP roads programme, Professor John Fitzgerald of the ESRI says: “It does not appear that these additions have been properly justified and the additional expenditure that they will require may not be warranted”.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Despite its lack of strategic analysis the Fitzpatricks report recognises a fundamental problem – that in current budgetary circumstances we cannot fund the current roads programme before the NRA. Even though we are giving €1.3 billion to it and have promised the same amount for the next three years, there is still a funding shortfall the Minister will have to address. The Fitzpatricks report suggests we should look at new funding – though I find it hard to believe the Government can argue for yet more money for roads in the current economic climate – or rescheduling projects, the national roads needs study and our priorities. That is what should happen. The NRA is not the appropriate body to do so, however. The new Transport Development Authority, in conjunction with the Minister and his Department, would do this job best.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Nobody would argue that we need the capacity which will be provided. In certain locations near major urban junctions we might need a certain increase in capacity but not on the scale planned by the Government. The major argument in favour of this proposal is the safety argument but the evidence for such dual carriageways providing increased safety is very mixed, depending on which country's experience one examines. The way the NRA is developing the network, without proper service stations or proper barriers in the centre of motorways, makes it difficult to credit the arguments being made for increased safety. The real crime is the fact that the NRA spends only 1.2% of the roads programme budget on safety measures. That is a real safety problem. If the amount was significantly increased, we might save lives as the Minister wishes without having to build this new superfluous motorway system.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Safety was an issue which drove public transport expenditure. The Minister's predecessor, then Deputy O'Rourke, spent most of the life of the last Government heralding a new era for rail but in reality very little new public transport capacity was provided. In the main the western, south-western and northern rail lines were made safe, which was welcome, but it was not an increase in public transport capacity. I welcome the arrival of the Railway Procurement Agency, an excellent organisation with some very talented individuals. The skills in the organisation could easily be applied to the NRA. A joint authority would make a lot of economic and administrative sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I have a problem with the way the Minister has handled the first RPA report which deals with a metro for Dublin. It has been on his desk for six months. Monthly leaks indicate the metro has gone from a €2 billion project likely to go ahead to one costing from €3 billion to €6 billion which is stymied by the Minister for Finance. The Department of Finance is not the appropriate body to decide on our transport spending. We need independent transport analysis, not only of the metro but also of the strategic rail study which  is also sitting on the Minister's desk for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The strategic rail study mirrors the NRA's proposal, according to the leaks, by appearing to suggest we need to concentrate on interurban journeys. The same priority is being suggested for the roads programme but we have to analyse these to determine which will give us the best return which would probably come from investment in short distance urban commuting solutions, for which we would need a proper, independent authority to analyse the merits of one case against the other. That is the reason we have proposed this Bill. I trust other parties and the Government will see the merit in our case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_393">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_653">In an era of retrenchment in Government finances strong analysis must be carried out to learn the reason profligate spending has been allowed in the provision of transport infrastructure. This is true of individual projects. There has also been a lack of overall control in delivering the national infrastructure which is undoubtedly necessary. It is not being prioritised properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Regarding the funds set aside by the Government, as Deputy Ryan said, the national road needs survey by the NRA specified an easily provided, low cost road network. The Government appeared to decide subsequently that this needed to be augmented when developing its national development plan, possibly through advice from State agencies which have nothing to do with proper transport planning. Even at that stage the NDP projections for spending on the road network amounted to €5.6 billion. The most recent estimate of the cost of providing the same roads programme is €14.8 billion. Questions have to be asked as to how this degree of inflation has been allowed to occur over a short period and the reason it has not delivered either faster completion of projects or better infrastructure, particularly roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Part of the reason is that the National Roads Authority has been extremely deficient in performing the task for which it was established, namely, to provide a cost effective and geographically widespread roads infrastructure. On any criteria it has failed. It has overspent its available account to a colossal degree –€250 million in the past two years alone – yet most debate on overspending focuses on the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, areas for which the general public perceives a great need. It appears accountability and Government scrutiny, particularly by the Department of Finance, are much more rigorously applied to these Departments than to the provision of transport infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Even when one considers in isolation projects for which the National Roads Authority is  responsible, one finds they have gone significantly over budget. The projected cost of the Dublin Port tunnel, the largest infrastructural project in the country, has increased to €625 million, some €450 million more than the original estimate. The Nenagh to Limerick road is set to overrun the originally projected cost by €115 million, while the overruns for the stretch of the N4 from Kilcock to Kinnegad, the Glen of the Downs and the Kildare bypass are €85 million, €50 million and €35 million, respectively. How can these figures be justified in an era in which the Government is telling the public that belt tightening is necessary and public expenditure on important public services will be less than in recent years?</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Whatever the real cost of the proposed metro link to Dublin Airport, the most recent projections by the Rail Procurement Agency appear to indicate it would cost six times more than a rail line of similar length already completed in Madrid. How could this be possible? Part of the reason is that cost overruns become inevitable if competing organisations, rather than a single co-ordinated integrated agency, are involved in providing transport infrastructure because the remit of each is to provide projects within the system for which it is responsible. The National Roads Authority, for example, would not produce an analysis in favour of getting people from A to B by means other than road. It would choose the road option in all circumstances and, as we know, will choose the motorway option regardless of whether it is justified in terms of traffic volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">With regard to the Government's funding plans for meeting the infrastructural shortfall, the Minister announced with great fanfare the public private partnership for a section of the Dublin to Galway road. While this may provide a completed infrastructure in what he believes is the shortest feasible period, the ultimate cost to the taxpayer will be greater. Public private partnership or the private finance initiative as it is known in Britain is not an effective mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Road tolling should not be imposed to allow the Government or contractor to recoup its investment. Specific strategic reasons are required to justify traffic being directed either in, out or around towns. The Government's policy on PPPs is not guided by such reasons, it is merely an exercise for generating the funding required in the quickest possible time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_660">I welcome the legislation proposed by the Green Party. It gives the House an opportunity to discuss the important issue of transport. Sinn Féin has long been on record as supporting the creation of a national transport authority as a positive step towards the development of an integrated all-Ireland strategy on public transport and infrastructural development. Ireland requires an integrated transport plan that puts the overall  needs of the economy and all sections of society before sectional interests and profiteering. We need co-operation between the different modes of transport, trains, buses and roads. This requires the centralisation of responsibility for transport in one authority. The possibility of establishing a transport police force as part of the overall authority should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The Government's move to break up CIE represents the wrong kind of transport policy. Instead of a public transport system which works in a co-ordinated fashion, the Minister proposes that its various elements compete against each other. At one of his first meetings with CIE following his appointment he told the company he believed the subvention it received from the State should be reduced, rather than increased to a level which would allow it to realistically tackle the problems it faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">We need to address decades of underfunding in our transport system. The most recent comparative study of investment in urban public transport in European cities indicated Dublin had the third lowest subvention rate for urban bus services. While I accept more money has been invested in Dublin Bus since the report was published on which I congratulate the Government, we are still playing catch-up in many other areas following many years during which our public transport service was expected to survive on paltry assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">It is still the case that people returning from visits abroad, especially to such countries as France and Germany, view the prospect of using Dublin Bus again with trepidation. It is the staff of the organisation which ensures this overstretched public transport network operates so efficiently. Ironically, these men and women often bear the brunt of the anger of disgruntled passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Question marks remain over the Government's commitment to maintaining public transport and State ownership of companies such as Aer Lingus. Following his appointment, the Minister said the State should not be involved in commercial activities in which it did not want to be involved. I hope he does not regard public transport as a commercial activity as opposed to a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The legislation before us would play a major part in ensuring the response to the needs of citizens by our public transport system would be more reliable and efficient. The planned development and proper maintenance of our road network are essential parts of an integrated transport strategy. However, a balance must be struck between the development of new, improved roads and the development of a more extensive public transport network. It is Sinn Féin's firm belief that an efficient, effective, reliable, affordable and safe public transport system is the solution to urban traffic congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">In areas outside Dublin and other urban centres across the island, we need to take seriously the need for a much improved rural public transport network. Public transport is vital, especially for groups such as the young, the elderly and the less well-off. For young people the cost of buying and running a car, particularly given the rising cost of motor insurance, is a pipedream. These sections of society can find themselves cut off from employment, education and social opportunities as a result of the poor public transport system. My constituency, in which houses were built without a transport system, has for years been a prime example of this problem. I regularly cite the example of Intel and the fact that young people from Tallaght and elsewhere in Dublin south-west find it impossible to get to Leixlip to take up jobs in the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The reliance in rural areas on private motor cars is a result of the lack of investment in rural transport. In many parts of the country it is impossible to get around. A glance at a map of the rail network provides a perfect example of the effect of partition on transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">It is essential for social and economic development and those reliant on cars to get around that the national roads infrastructure is upgraded and planned projects are commenced and completed on time. While I welcome the investment the Government has made in the construction of new roads across the State and the assistance we have received from the European Union, I cannot but be concerned about the use of public private partnerships and the tolling aspect of yesterday's announcement on the construction of a new stretch of motorway. I oppose the use of toll roads for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the imposition of a charge on a new road often means drivers who face higher tolls, especially drivers of heavy goods vehicles, will use older, narrow roads rather than pay a toll. That means that despite the massive investment in roads, the drivers of many heavy goods vehicles will continue to travel on roads that are unsuitable. The safety-congestion problems the toll roads are designed to put an end to will remain. It is madness that we build roads and then do everything to encourage drivers not to use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The profits made from the tolls on the Westlink and Eastlink routes amount to millions of euro every year and Eurolink will have 30 years to exploit the Irish motorist. Public private partnerships represent a serious failure by successive Governments to use resources provided by recent economic growth for social programmes and infrastructures that serve the population. Instead, big business has been the primary beneficiary of the economic boom of the past decade. Toll contracts are a licence to print money and it is clear from the profits these companies are making that that is what they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Before Christmas, the Taoiseach told the House that it was no secret that the Department of Finance had mixed feelings about public private partnerships, and it has given its views to a committee of the House. The Department believes that an excessive amount of money must be paid to financial institutions as part of the system. The only difference between the public private partnership in this case and the use of it in the construction of schools, for example, is that it is the people who will pay more in the long run, in this case motorists.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Sinn Féin has long suggested other options. For example, public bonds are often used in cities in the United States to fund major projects. In Wales, for example, Glas Cymru, a non-profit public company, issued £2 billion worth of bonds to buy the utility that supplies water and sewerage services to Wales. Public bonds have lower rates of interest which ensures that capital investment projects such as schools remain under public ownership and management.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Public private partnerships are unnecessary and represent the worst kind of short-term thinking. It would be more economically sensible to raise money for the development of our infrastructure through borrowing or increased taxation on the wealthy or big business instead of hitting the ordinary motorist.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I welcome the emphasis in the proposed legislation on involvement with local authorities and communities. It is important that the people who will be most directly affected by planned construction of roads are as involved as possible in the consultation process. Non-national roads are the responsibility of local authorities and the usage of them is often dependent on the construction of motorways nearby.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">An integral approach to this area is clearly needed. Non-national roads are the lifelines of rural communities and small towns. They cannot be merely seen as on-off ramps for motorways. They must continue to receive improved resources for upgrading and maintenance. More open consultation might have averted mistakes such as the farce that developed at Carrickmines where a valuable historic site was damaged by the routing of the M50 through a national monument.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">While we support the development of the authority as outlined in the legislation before the House, and its expansion on an all-Ireland basis, it is a long-standing belief of mine that appointments made to these types of bodies must be more open and transparent and the public better informed about them. The vacancies on the authority should be advertised in the national media, the criteria for the vacancies published and interviews held to ascertain the most suitable candidates for these positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">In the past we have seen State boards and bodies stacked by Ministers with political appointees  and positions handed out to financial backers and long-term supporters. The ordinary people have suffered as a result of that approach. Every effort should be made to make sure that there is worker representation from the various trade unions involved in the transport industry on the authority. The make-up of the authority should take into account the need to achieve the 40% gender balance target on State boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I hope to be given the opportunity of raising these issues on Committee Stage. I call on Members on all sides of the House to allow the Bill progress to Committee Stage so that a fuller debate on transport can take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">I understand the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has announced the first motorway to be built by public private partnership, the 39 km. route between Kilcock and Kinnegad, at an initial estimated cost of €420 million. I hope it will remain at that price through to its completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">A new and welcome feature of the contract is the clause which stipulates that if five or more cars are queuing at the toll booth, the toll gates must be lifted, at the tolling contractor's expense, until the congestion has eased or a heavy fine will be imposed. I foresee confusion arising, with gates being lifted sporadically when congestion arises. I hope that aspect of the contract has been thoroughly thought out by the Road Transport Authority, as it will now be known.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Arguments in favour of toll roads have been laced with references to free market principles, supply and demand and economic incentives. Any motorway of any consequence falls flat from the word "go" when we talk about market principles. Motorway routes are not assembled by willing buyers competing with other willing buyers who must negotiate with willing or unwilling sellers who are also in competition with one another. The National Transport Authority will identify the route it wants, establish what it considers to be a politically and judicially acceptable price and slap a compulsory purchase order on the land involved. Figuratively, this is market principles at the end of a gun barrel.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The number of potential road candidates for tolling is limited, primarily because of public resistance to imposing tolls on previously free  roads. The Minister has attempted to fly a few kites concerning the possibility of tolling existing roads but his suggestions have evoked public outcries due in no small part to public aversion to double taxation, having already paid their taxes many times over for these roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The funds generated by tolling new roads, if set in a way that reflects the cost of congestion, such as the central London congestion charge, could help decrease traffic delays for motorists who place a high value on their time or who are willing to pay. Other traffic would remain on toll free but more congested routes. However, toll roads can have significant social impacts in the manner and location of their construction and operation. These can be positive, providing improved access for some areas of the country, and negative, in degrading the environment around the road, for example, under an elevated urban motorway. Tolls can discourage unnecessary trips and therefore provide environmental benefits. However, traffic which diverts onto roads which pass through residential neighbourhoods will reduce the environmental benefits the new roads will provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The most promising candidates for toll roads in the shorter term are new roads and because these roads are new, motorists should have the alternative option of taking the toll free routes that were used before the new roads were built, thereby diminishing the effects on motorists. The fledgling National Transport Authority should direct its energies towards providing a quality roads infrastructure which would increase this country's attraction as a tourism destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Ireland lags behind some of the EU accession countries. This year, in advance of its forthcoming tourism season, Croatia, which is in the next tier of EU applicants for the year 2007, announced the completion of an extra 140 km. of motorway. In my constituency, both Cavan and Monaghan have been designated as hub towns under the Government's recently announced national spatial strategy. It is vital that local area framework plans be developed involving local authorities, both Monaghan County Council and its counterpart in Cavan, to jointly plan major transport infrastructure projects for these growth areas. Unless the appropriate infrastructure is provided, the spatial strategy will be in severe danger of being derailed and it will be incumbent on the new authority to prevent this from happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The National Transport Authority could also examine the possibility of developing a central or spinal north-south route through the middle of the country to complement the north-south coastal route which links Larne with the port of Rosslare. The NTA has a mammoth task ahead in fulfilling its objectives and I wish it well.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_689">I welcome the Bill. It will broaden the focus of transportation planning and  the provision of infrastructure by amalgamating the National Roads Authority and National Rail Procurement Agency. This makes sense for the transport and traffic areas. We need radical ideas to deal with the existing crisis and the Bill is a major step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Section 1 sets out a sensible and professional approach. We must co-ordinate transport planning and economic analysis of the proposed road and public transport projects to provide the Minister with an advisory priority listing and work schedule for major infrastructural projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">This debate is relevant to the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel and the disgraceful way the people of Marino, Fairview and Santry are being treated by senior management in Dublin City Council and the tunnel company. The port tunnel is causing major problems in the area, with homes being damaged, noise pollution and a complete lack of respect for local residents. Despite many promises and guarantees, trust has broken down completely and the people are sick to the back teeth of the attitude of the tunnel promoters.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">So far six homes have been damaged, with another 309 vulnerable to future damage. The damage to these houses was caused by the tunnel boring machine. Dublin City Council and the contractor, NMI, have admitted to knowing that tunnelling was directly responsible for substantial damage to at least six houses in the Annadale and Marino areas. Despite this, they have no intention of stopping or slowing down the tunnel boring machine and have made no serious changes to their work practices or methods to prevent damage to more houses. They are three to four months behind schedule and have ignored all residents' pleas to stop further damage. Already some residents are considering legal action or direct action, such as blockading or picketing the entrance to the tunnel. The tunnel has gone way beyond budget and that is also unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The section in the Bill that guarantees trade union involvement in the authority is essential. Were it not for the members of SIPTU working on the Dublin Port tunnel, residents would not have discovered what was happening. The workers discovered a lethal mix of poisons, including lead, zinc, mercury, copper and arsenic, along the route of the tunnel, none of which were natural constituents of the soil. They discovered a variety of heavy metals in thousands of tonnes of soil taken from Fairview Park and vast quantities of hospital and domestic waste close to the River Tolka and Dublin Bay. One can imagine the nightmare scenario if such waste got into either the bay or the river. Finally, they came across pipes through the site metres from the contaminated earth that carries water to the East Point Business Park and East Wall community. This information has been confirmed by Cal Limited, a Dún Laoghaire based chemical analysis  company. The consortium heading the €500 million project, NMI, planned to place this contaminated soil back over the tunnel and many people are naturally concerned about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The Minister must act on the question of the Dublin Port tunnel. There should be an immediate investigation by the Department of Health and Children and the health board into the health and safety issues raised by the tunnel. The Minister for Transport must end the secrecy and spin surrounding the project. Many different stories are floating around the northside about the Dublin Port Tunnel and there is serious concern about potential pollution of the River Tolka and Dublin Bay. Yesterday, members of the Minister's own party on Dublin City Council backed my emergency motion which supported the residents of Marino whose homes have been damaged by recent tunnelling. We also demanded that all families receive fair compensation and that concerned residents be given an up to date safety report. The Minister should consider a reduction in the speed of the tunnel boring machine that is causing the problem. The 30 metre zone of influence must also be doubled because many families outside that area are also seeing damage to their houses. The independent consultant, Dr. De Freitas, must be recalled from London to assist, advise and support the residents.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Section 4 states that the authority should carry out regular cost estimates and work programme reviews on the major transport projects being carried out by the State. It is strong on efficiency, professionalism and accountability. This is the way forward because it increases productivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Section 6 states that each member of the authority will be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has wide experience and competence in one or more of the following – railways, transportation, planning, urban development, environmental sustainability, industry and others. This will further introduce a professional attitude to transport planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Section 5 ensures that decisions cannot be made without the approval of Dáil Éireann, ensuring democratic accountability and a progressive way forward in terms of transport and the broader political community.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">This is a sensible Bill that shows a clear vision for transport in the future. It has the potential to change our transport system and old fashioned ideas about transport. We must be more radical and creative in planning for the railways. There must be serious investment to attract passengers and to remove heavy trucks from the roads. Trains are a part of the future and ignoring that reality will spell disaster for transport policy. This Bill will assist that vision and I urge all Deputies to support it. To reject the Bill is to turn one's back on quality and efficient planning for our transport needs in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_699">I acknowledge the work the Green Party has put into this legislation and I have no difficulty with the vision behind it – the better integration of our public transport system. Neither do I have a problem with looking at the balance of the investment between roads and railways as we must always keep an eye on that. Some years it is out of sync and other years it is more favourable, depending on the profile of capital investment, which can vary.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The new Department of Transport, however, was put in place precisely to conduct such policy work. Before the Government was formed, national roads were dealt with by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the railway network was handled by the Department of Public Enterprise. The case could be made that it was difficult to co-ordinate the crucial decisions in investment alternatives between road and rail in circumstances where different Departments were responsible for different areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I accept this idea is good and that we should do more to co-ordinate and integrate. In rejecting the Bill, I do so in the spirit of agreeing with the principle of better integration while pointing out that the new Department of Transport exists precisely for that purpose. Having regard to the position of the State in the context of road versus rail transport, it would be extremely undemocratic to hand over responsibility for those policy issues to an appointed board of individuals, as proposed in the Bill. Accordingly, I suggest, reluctantly, that this Bill is not the way to proceed. I believe it would create a void by abolishing two existing agencies, the NRA and the RPA, which are currently delivering projects. It proposes to replace them with a co-ordinating, advising, liaising role. As it is drafted – I appreciate that the proposers of the Bill do not have the back-up which is available to Government – it is a toothless and limbless Bill which concentrates on advising and liaising.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The Bill does not propose to give the new agency any real powers, such as negotiating and financing contracts or implementing a single piece of transport infrastructure. In many ways, the Bill abolishes essential functions of existing agencies without doing anything to replace them. The functions which it allocates to the new agency are clearly those which should be carried out by the new Department of Transport, in terms of policy issues which should not be handed over to individual appointees of any Minister. Section 4 of the Bill does not assign responsibility for the delivery of projects. In the case of the RPA, the Bill also, effectively, removes very important powers which are necessary for the delivery of metro and light rail. For example, it removes the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land, procure light rail services and negotiate contracts. Similarly, in relation to the NRA, the  Bill does not deal with the practical issues of "who does what".</p>
          <p eId="para_703">While accepting, as it were, the decent thought behind the Bill, the Bill as drafted, in effect, sets out to abolish two organisations which are working flat out to achieve something and to replace them with an authority without authority. The proposed authority is only required—</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_708">The Bill which is now before the House and on which we will be expected to vote seeks to amalgamate the RPA and the NRA into a new authority without transposing that authority into the new legislation. That is a point worth bringing to the attention of the House. What the Deputies opposite are saying is that if they had the power to do so, they would have included sections in the Bill to give the required power to the authority. I accept that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">At a meeting of the Public Transport Forum in November 2002, I set out my proposals for the regulatory and structural reform of public transport in Ireland. My objective in that regard is the delivery of more services of better quality and greater transparency and accountability and to ensure that transport operators, of which I hope there will be a number, will be clear as to what is required of them. I am proposing the establishment of an independent regulator for public transport, not just in the greater Dublin area but also, in due course, outside that area. I have not finally decided on the precise form of that regulation but will soon do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Government must continue to have overall responsibility for policy matters but need not always have responsibility for operational matters. It is vitally important that the procurement and regulation of public transport services is undertaken within a clear policy framework set down by Government. The regulatory framework which I envisage will allocate current capital funding to a regulatory authority which, in turn, will allocate it to operators on a basis laid down in policy and legislation by this House. The new independent regulatory authority which I foresee will procure bus and commuter services in the Dublin area and will allocate State funding on the basis of public service contracts with Dublin Bus,  Bus Éireann and private operators. It will also negotiate multi-annual service contracts, regulate public transport fares, enforce quality and standards and approve the relevant service contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The Bill before the House would take virtually all policy formulation away from the Government of the day. I am opposed to the allocation of such major policy work to an appointed board. It is much more democratic that the Government, the Minister of the day, and this House should retain responsibility for policy decisions as to whether we build roads or railways rather than handing that vital function over to a board nominated by a Minister. Such a board might take an independent course, perhaps without reference to this House. For example, it might decide to build a transport system consisting of 80% railways and 20% roads, or <i>vice versa.</i> That is an unduly onerous policy issue to hand over to an appointed board of that nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Strong and effective action on traffic management is, of course, required throughout the Dublin area. We have to make more progress in developing an effective system of bus priorities, including additional bus lanes which will shortly come on stream. A project team has been established by the Director of Traffic for that purpose. We are also developing a clear and robust strategic land use and transportation planning framework. One cannot develop public transport investment in isolation. There has to be a land use and spatial strategy aspect to the development of transportation policy. All those elements must be properly integrated. My proposals will provide a very clear framework for the future regulation of public transport services.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">While I take the point made earlier by Deputy Boyle, the proposals in this Bill appear to involve a purely advisory role, without any of the powers a regulatory authority should have, outside the financial area. Public transport in this country is obviously in need of reform. I have already set out some of the required reforms and will have more to say in that regard soon. I do not believe the establishment of the type of authority proposed in this Bill would bring about the necessary reforms. The RPA is there to undertake the task of developing the Luas and the metro. The NRA has the task of developing our road system. In my view, those bodies should be allowed to get on with those responsibilities rather than being interrupted by some new reshuffling of deck chairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">I am committed to the creation of a high quality transport service to tackle existing bottlenecks and congestion and to support a vigorous programme of spatial development aimed at rebalancing growth as between the regions. The new, integrated, single Department of Transport was put in place by the Taoiseach at the formation of this Government to give effect to that focus. Communications and other areas of responsibility of the former Department of Public Enterprise  have now been assigned elsewhere, with the result that the new Department of Transport can concentrate on issues such as those brought forward this evening by the Deputies opposite. In the final analysis, I and my Department are responsible to this House for the strategies which we assign to the agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I am opposed to giving an agency the type of powers proposed in this Bill. The role of agencies should be to carry out the policies determined by the Government and this House. They should not be given a broad policy brief which is more properly the responsibility of the Members of this House. The job of the RPA is to develop light rail and metro services, enter into PPP agreements, develop concessions and joint ventures and acquire property where that will contribute to the economic viability of the rail network. The RPA is also developing an integrated ticketing system, which is an important facility for Dublin city and the country in general. It has also taken over the light rail project office of CIE in relation to the construction of Luas. The construction of the two lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green is progressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I recently announced the updated completion dates supplied to me by the RPA – May 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station line and March 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line. However, one should add three months in each case for testing and commissioning. I have conveyed my concerns, privately and publicly, to the RPA about those new dates, insisting that there must be no further delays in delivery of those projects. I noted the Deputies' comments about the costs of the metro system. On another occasion, I will be happy to outline to the House the overall situation in that regard. No decision with regard to the metro has been taken at this time. The RPA is to bring forward an outline business case. The figures which have been published in the newspapers were the figures suggested to me in a presentation from the RPA. I have yet to examine those fully. At an appropriate time, we can have a debate in this House on the metro. I do not accept the costs at the level at which they are suggested and I believe we can make real progress on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The final costs of projects are determined by many factors, including the cost of property, route alignment, construction inflation and CPOs. This House might soon consider proposals from the Government on how we might sort out some of these infrastructural issues. In short, the country is coming down with plans in the transport area. The options have been studied to death. We are overloaded with agencies. Frankly what is required now is delivery on all of these projects. We know what has to be done. Between all of us, we have a habit of taking seven or eight years to do some thing that should be done in three or four years. That will test the belief of this House and of the Government in what types of changes are acceptable to shorten that timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I am looking at the possibility of a special infrastructure Bill which will deal with issues of land ownership for critical infrastructures, both above and below the ground. It will deal with the issues of compulsory purchase orders and who makes them. It will deal with the issues of the role of the local authorities in regard to the NRA, what that role should be and how strong it should be in the future. I hope it will deal with the issues of how we acquire property, and particularly what length of appeals are permitted and how we might bring some finality to appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The delays in projects undertaken do not usually begin from the moment we start digging. They begin from the moment we decide to undertake a project until we start turning the first sod and they can run into years. We have to shorten that cycle. If we do so, we will reduce the cost. If something is down for nine years and one can do it in four, one will do it much cheaper because the sum one factors in for risk will reduce dramatically, as will inflation and other costs. This House must look at the speed with which we deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">There is not that much difference between us in this House on what must be delivered. Nobody in this House is against upgrading the Galway-Dublin railway line, the Luas or building motorways to Cork, Limerick or Waterford. Deputy Eamon Ryan is against building motorways but I would like to hear him say clearly on the record that his party is against building those motorways. I believe we must build motorways to the main cities and we are doing so. We must provide high-speed intercity services and more investment in commuter rail services. While there is not much difference between us on what must be done, we might soon start to look at how quickly we can start to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I saw Deputy Eamon Ryan's press release earlier – somebody does take account of what he says. He stated in it that public spending on roads is six times higher than on public transport. Spending on roads this year is €1.2 billion and the investment in the railway is €400 million. According to my sums, that is a ratio of 3:1. I do not want to get picky about that, but his press release stated it was 6:1 and I would hate the public to hear that on the airwaves when in fact the ratio is 3:1.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The ratio is probably better than 3:1 because he was referring to public transport and buses use these roads. If he only includes rail, then he would get a better ratio. We need to build the roads for the buses and I presume the Deputy is in favour of buses, which are a form of public transport for places where we cannot put down railway tracks for all sorts of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I am opposed to the legislation for those reasons, not for the genuine thinking behind it but for the fact that it would be an administrative mess. It would take away from the NRA and the RPA the focus which they now have to forge ahead. If we were to try to re-scramble this egg instead of letting them proceed, it would set projects back years. I ask the House to reject the legislation on those grounds.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">No, I am quite happy with my boundaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I also congratulate my party colleague, Deputy Brennan, who, in the 292 days he has been Minister for Transport, has moved at great speed and has shown particular tenacity in dealing with the transport organisations listed in his Department's portfolio. Deputy Brennan has shown that improvements can be achieved, that change will be implemented in all transport sectors and that the cultures which exist at all levels within our transport related organisations, must change quickly. It is important that public sector employees and managers remember that they are there to serve their customers and not to maintain their own personal empires. Change is never easy but there must be change. Through internal partnership-style discussions and industrial relations networks, I look forward to seeing all involved embracing change and not holding it back because of vested interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">We now have a Minister who is delivering and who will not become a victim of red tape or the departmental project board syndrome, where the problem goes in this month and comes out in three years when the solution is no longer relevant. I hope he keeps up the momentum. Many colleagues and I will confirm that our constituents support his deeds to date and look forward to enjoying the transport solutions that I believe are on the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">In the past I have mentioned how important the Luas project is to me personally and to my constituents, and I need not remind the House  where my constituents live. However, I want to make a couple of points to which I was glad to hear the Minister refer. While supporting the Minister, I would also say to him that I am not necessarily a fan of the agencies. It is important that we would retain our right to criticise when criticism is due. I have often raised issues with the NRA and, recently, with the Railway Procurement Agency. It is right to do so and we need to continue to do that. In doing so I am not stifled by being a Government backbencher.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">What is the Railway Procurement Agency at? It seems to be engaging in a singular policy to upset and delay Luas, which is clearly a much-needed project. I will, on this occasion, list only three areas where it has undermined confidence in the Luas project in my constituency of Dublin South-West. First, the project, as the Minister conceded, is grossly behind schedule. This is hard to understand when one considers the amount of money spent and available, and the number of contractors involved. One must remember that the bulk of the land covered by the Luas had already been purchased in many parts of Tallaght and Kingswood, and had lain waste for many years. With significant overspends on the project, where is the accountability from the agency for these delays and overspends? Where does the responsibility rest within the agency on these matters? The answer seems to get lost in a mist of silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Second, I find it incredible that communications with householders and community associations along the Luas route appear at face value to have dried up. It appears that the public and community groups are unable to get all the information they require and in many situations are left with no responses to the issues they raise. I and other colleagues have asked a number of parliamentary questions in this regard in recent times. I remind the managers of the railway procurement agency that these same residents pay for the organisation and, as a committed supporter of the Government's strategic management initiative, I want to remind the agency that it states that the customer is to be the main focus of all public sector endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Even on the public relations front, the planning of the interchange at the Red Cow roundabout is a debacle. The commuters who use this area say that on a daily basis it cannot work and that a tunnel or a bridge should have been part of the plan. The excuse that traffic volumes have exceeded estimates only serves to point out that the agency in charge of planning is not on the ball. While on the subject of planning the Luas line, I will state once again that there is both an economic and a social justification for the Luas to be extended, in my area of Tallaght, into Old Bawn, through west Tallaght and on to Citywest. I have said this at every opportunity in the House. It makes no sense whatsoever not to extend the  Luas line through Tallaght and out to Saggart and it should be done now. Otherwise, it will have to be done in the future at much greater cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I do not know about that. If it happens in 20 years, Deputy Naughten will be doing well.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I am not happy to admit it, but I travel to the House most days in my car. I am sorry about that. I would much prefer to do it some other way, but I do not have the energy every day to walk the nine miles – although some nights I feel so invigorated by life in the House that I feel like walking – and public transport is a challenge. Every day as I pass through Tallaght and south west Dublin and watch the work being done, I eagerly await the completion of the Luas. I hope I have the opportunity of making use of what I believe will be a fine part of the city's transport structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">It is important that this debate takes place. I am a supporter of Private Members' Business. That is not to say, however, that I will ever vote against the Government – I have been telling journalists in Tallaght recently, in answer to this routine question, that the answer is "No way". I believe that I have a strong role to play as a Government backbencher, bringing the problems of my constituents into the House and, through the Ministers, to the Government. It is important that we all take the opportunity of doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I complimented the Green Party on its introduction of this Bill earlier on. This discussion is important as it gives all of us the opportunity of raising our concerns. I am not afraid to articulate the problems as I see them. I am glad to acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, and he should know that it is important that we listen to what the communities are saying to us. As I mentioned earlier, even though the Minister for Transport is making progress, there are still challenges out there. I thank him for allowing me to share his time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_414">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_742">I wish to share my time with Deputies Pat Breen and Seán Ryan.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill and I commend the Green Party for introducing it and giving us the opportunity of debating the issue of transport and the lack of action that has taken place since this Government took office nearly six years ago. The personal, abject failure of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to expedite the  solution of the escalating crisis in transport in the Dublin area is a perfect example of the Government's gross inability to manage public projects. We remember the hype over Luas. Its introduction was scheduled for 2003 and, since then, every five minutes. Tonight the Minister has publicly admitted that this project, already late and over budget, is now running a further three months behind schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Luas system in Deputy O'Connor's constituency is a sham. The Red Cow interchange is a joke and will cause traffic chaos as soon as it commences operation. Some genius decided to put a park-and-ride facility at Newlands Cross without putting either an overpass or an underpass in place, so that everyone using the facility will have to cross over to the southern side of the Naas Road. This sort of thing is happening throughout the country. The Minister cannot set costs, control budgets or manage projects. He is confusing public relations with public life. He cannot differentiate between announcing a project and actually delivering on it. His only motto is that a promise a day keeps reality away, and the Minister, based on what Deputy O'Connor said, has made 292 promises in his last 292 days in office. If he stayed in office for another 292 months he still would not deliver on projects planned under the national development plan. I would not inflict that on any country or any constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The Minister's ineptitude has actually reduced the average travel speed on some Dublin city routes to 5 mph. That is slower than travelling by ass and cart a hundred years ago. The gridlock in the capital is costing city businesses more than €650 million per annum. We need, as a matter of urgency, a single transport authority to deal with these grave problems. At the moment there are 23 different Departments, Government agencies and non-governmental organisations involved in traffic management. We urgently need not only a Dublin authority but a national authority with responsibility for transport throughout the country. It should immediately be given responsibility for traffic management, transport infrastructure and public transport and analyse the possibility of integrated land-use planning. This Bill is a positive step in this direction, even though it has some flaws. The Minister has pointed out one of those flaws, namely the lack of accountability to the House. That Bill can be amended on Committee Stage, however, to provide that level of accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Minister spoke about his plans tonight. He has done this <i>ad nauseam</i> since he was appointed. He has never, however, addressed the issue of how to make use of our existing assets, some of which could be utilised tomorrow morning to benefit the people of this city. Grand schemes overshadow practical, inexpensive and short-term solutions. For example, the Phoenix Park tunnel is a double rail line going from Heuston to Con nolly Station, which could provide a metro system through the city centre tomorrow morning. The Minister's solution is to spend €1 billion to sink a new tunnel under the River Liffey. The network is already there, fully signalled and up to date, but Iarnród Éireann is using every excuse in the book not to avail of it. That rail line is an easy, inexpensive way to provide a metro solution in the capital. It would bring people into the city centre, rather than dumping them nearly three miles away, so they could connect with the other public transport systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">In tandem with this, we need to address the issue of a central corridor between Connolly and Pearse Stations. Iarnród Éireann has cancelled the budget for that project, although it recently advertised for tenders. If built, it could increase rail capacity in the city centre, allowing for more trains to pass through.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Iarnród Éireann's advertising slogan is, "We're not there yet, but we're getting there."  It says there are 67 new carriages on the way, but fails to tell us that they are only replacing 67 carriages that are to be decommissioned. There will not be one new carriage on the inter-city network when those carriages come into the system. No additional capacity will be provided. In every other European country, carriages are leased. Diesel multiple units like the Arrow provide commuter services throughout the UK. There is no reason for not doing the same thing here. It would provide commuter services for a fraction of the cost. For example, we have been talking for years about re-opening the Clonsilla-Navan line. A rail line runs today from Navan, via Slane and Duleek, to Drogheda, which could provide a commuter service for the people of Navan tomorrow morning if the political will was there – if the Government was committed to doing it. We could do it by leasing carriages, putting them on the track relatively quickly, but the Government is not prepared to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">On the Atlantic rail corridor, Irish Rail is pulling up more of the rail line every week. Yet there is a group in Galway which through a public private partnership is prepared to open part of that line and provide a commuter service into Galway city. There are other towns and cities along that route where commuter services could be developed tomorrow morning and then services along the rest of the Atlantic corridor could be developed. It would connect the cities, towns and many rural communities along the western corridor to international markets by using the ports at Rosslare, Waterford and Foynes. The rail line to Foynes Port is gathering dust even though the investment is being put in. The state-of-the-art deep-water port, which is the best in the country, is lying idle because Irish Rail is not prepared to use and develop those facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Who honestly believes the Minister when he says the Dublin metro link to the airport will be  completed by 2007? However, we could provide it relatively quickly for a fraction of the cost by way of a spur off the Maynooth line or more logically a spur off the northern line via Swords, a large town with no facilities. The Government is not prepared to prioritise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Roads provide the predominant internal transport in the country, carrying 95% of passengers and 93% of freight. I disagree with Deputy Eamon Ryan's position on the motorways. Nobody could logically say there is no need for a new motorway between Athlone and Ballinasloe in my constituency. The original proposal in the needs study of the National Roads Authority was for a reduced width dual carriageway along that section of road. There would be slaughter every day if that were to go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">There is need for investment in motorways but the Government's budgets have gone crazy. The national roads programme has targeted 800 kilometres of motorway costing more than €22 billion and rising daily. The total budget under the national development plan is €40 billion. There is a huge shortfall in the budget for our roads. Many of those roads will not be completed until at least 2009, which the Minister has yet failed to admit. Only 12 of the 34 roads projects that were to go ahead this year will get the green light. This is a typical sham by Government, trying to fudge the issues and not give the figures, as it should. We have yet to see accurate figures for the costs of those roads projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">In the short-term we should better utilise our existing road space. We should have Operation Freeflow on a 365-day basis to relieve the congestion in this city. We should extend the opening hours of Dublin Port so that we do not have heavy goods vehicles travelling along the quays during rush hour. The Minister's solution is the Dublin Port tunnel, which will not be able to take 10% of the heavy goods vehicles when it opens. The Minister's typical Irish solution to an Irish problem is to ban lorries from the roads. The Minister obviously does not realise the tight margins to which many in the haulage industry are operating at the moment and their need to increase the size of their vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Last year Dublin Bus received 28 extra busses which was about one third of what it received in 2000. Because of the comments of the Minister for Transport the spotlight is now focused on deregulation. However he has failed to provide a comprehensive plan on how deregulation should happen. Unplanned and unco-ordinated public transport deregulation in the capital and outside would lead to a hybrid which would ultimately not serve the consumer who must be king on this. A key element of introducing a deregulated transport system and competition in Dublin is integrated ticketing. The Minister has revealed in answer to parliamentary questions that it will be at least 2005 before there will be integrated tick eting in the city of Dublin not to mention throughout the country. He cannot introduce competition without integrated ticketing and we have yet to see that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Park and ride facilities were initially promised in 1991 and that has been policy since 1993. However, we still do not have park and ride facilities in this city. The quality bus corridors are being let down by the lack of such facilities. It is ironic that the DTO states that park and ride facilities will not work, yet at the Dart stations where they are provided people are using them. Irish Rail has returned funds to the Department to provide park and ride facilities because it cannot utilise them. That is the kind of issue that is leading to frustration.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Everyone on this side of the House and privately everyone on the other side will agree that section 1 of this Bill is probably the most significant element of it. This provides for the abolition of an unaccountable organisation such as the National Roads Authority. I am sure representatives of the NRA will read the report of the debate tonight and I will get a nice little letter next week about it. The National Roads Authority is unaccountable to this House and until that changes we will see legislation like this coming forward. We must ensure that we get the accountability required.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_415">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_757">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I commend the Green Party for introducing it. It is a very important Bill that links the future development plan of transport with local authorities and Departments. Transport, whether rail or road, is the key to the economic development of any town or city. While I welcome the new Department of Transport and the fact that responsibility for roads now rests with the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and not with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, we need much more integration and above all accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Proper planning is needed in today's ever-changing world. We look back at the many mistakes made in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Government policy to close down many of the railway lines in favour of the road network. This was a great error of judgment and as a result many goods vehicles took over our national primary, secondary and regional routes. The large number of vehicles on the roads has led to many fatalities and the need for continual road restoration and repairs at enormous cost to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Today Iarnród Éireann has the same policy and only wants to develop profitable intercity routes. It is not interested in the development of freight transport, which represents another bad judgment and is short-sighted. A national transport authority could address this issue. When the  strategic rail review is published in the near future, I hope it addresses the question of proper regional balance. The railway line between Ennis and Limerick is currently being upgraded and by the end of the year there will be a proper continuous welded railway system in place which will cut the journey time by half and will, I hope, provide a commuter service linking Ennis to Limerick and to the intercity routes. While I welcome this development, it only addresses part of the problem. The line from Ennis to Galway must be completed to open up the western corridor to link Ennis to Athenry, Galway, Claremorris and Sligo. This should be part of any future balanced regional development. Towns like this can only realise industrial and tourism growth with the proper road and rail infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">In recent times, local authorities have prepared local area plans to address proper industrial planning and the housing needs of local communities. While this is again a welcome development it must be done in conjunction with the development of proper access. Recently the road building projects have gone out of control, which will have an adverse effect on future developments. The road building programme is way behind schedule with many important projects not envisioned to be completed for many years. Costs are totally out of control, there is little accountability and the future of important road projects looks uncertain.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">An Ennis bypass was promised 20 years ago, indeed many planning applications were held up as we were told the by-pass was going ahead. The Ennis bypass still has not commenced. While it was to commence in 2001, the tender process was suspended.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_763">The Government made many promises before it came to office that the bypass would commence in 2003. It has not commenced yet and we have had no written confirmation that it will commence in 2004. The Ennis bypass is of central importance to the development of the west, industrial development in the town of Ennis itself and the development of Shannon Airport. While its original cost was to have been €140 million, by the time contracts are signed it will have substantially increased. If we had a national transport authority, priority would be given to projects such as the Ennis bypass.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The Northern Ireland roads authority and the NRA recently addressed the Joint Committee on Transport. The efficiency of the NRA was evident. It has accountability for all roads, even including footpaths. While the NRA is an independent authority, the Minister still dictates the projects that go ahead each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">An independent board to co-ordinate road, rail and all forms of public transport, made up of  people with experience in the field could liaise with local authorities and the Government. It would be a welcome development and could be a watchdog for public spending.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_766">Given the limited resources available to the smaller parties, I compliment the Green Party on its initiative in introducing this Bill. The Bill is imperfect and there are elements on which the Labour Party would differ from the Green Party. I will deal with the broad principles of the Bill. This Bill seeks to introduce a co-ordinated transport authority with a view to prioritising public transport projects and ensuring they will be carried through. There must also be a co-ordinated approach to strategic planning, which unfortunately does not currently exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">In his contribution, the Minister referred to a platform for change. The decision of the Government to withhold funding from Iarnród Éireann for infrastructural improvements along the central corridor between Connolly Station and Barrack Street is scandalous. This is required as it would facilitate the increase from 12 to 16 trains per hour at peak periods. The decision to defer these works to phase two of the DASH programme will have major implications for existing and potential commuters in the new growth areas of greater Dublin as the necessary works will not commence before 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">What is going to happen before then? It is expected that 80 new rail carriages will be brought into operation before the end of 2003. This will facilitate the replacement of old stock and the provision of eight-carriage trains. The net effect of this is the provision of approximately 2,000 places for commuters at peak periods on the northern suburban line. As a result of the decision to withhold funding, this will be the only increase in capacity between 2003 and 2008 at the earliest. This is an outrageous decision that reflects the lack of Government commitment towards the proper planning and development of the rail system.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">We have copies of the strategic planning guidelines which outline major residential developments in existing towns and villages along the rail corridors. This is as it should be. For example, 8,500 dwellings will be built in Fingal between now and 2006. Houses in my constituency are being sold on the basis of the availability of a quality rail service. Such a service is not available and will not become available unless the Government decision is overturned. The problem of chronic overcrowding on trains is causing grief, stress and frustration for commuters. At peak periods commuters, including young children, are literally being squeezed onto trains. Some pregnant women bring their own seats onto the trains. Incidents of people fainting are regular occurrences on trains that passengers call the "Sardine Expresses".</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The net effect of this problem is the people of Fingal and commuters on the rail system throughout the greater Dublin area are suffering deterioration in the quality of their lives. This does not even begin to reflect the implications of the Government strategy, "Strategic Planning Guidelines for the Region", driven by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. While the population of Balbriggan has increased threefold to 30,000 and the populations of Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Baldoyle and Portmarnock have also increased, there are no trains to meet the increased demand from commuters.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Unless these matters are given greater priority in funding, we will face utter disaster. There will be further congestion on the roads as the public transport system will not be able to cater for those who live in new housing developments. There is no point in one arm of Government telling local authorities to build homes on the basis of promised transport infrastructure while not meeting its commitments on this. The Government has failed the people of my constituency. It is scandalous that people are mortgaging themselves to the hilt on the basis of a public service provision that will not be fulfilled. It is telling Iarnód Éireann to move into phase two. I seek a positive response from the Minister tomorrow night.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_859">I am pleased to introduce the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] to the Dáil. I welcome it, in particular, because our debate gives us the opportunity to spell out the Government's position and to chal lenge the unfair and inaccurate claims which have been made in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The Government's position on freedom of information is simple and straightforward. The changes to the legislation proposed in the Bill are based on the need to ensure that the business of Government can be properly and efficiently organised. The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Government to carry out its work, no more and no less. The Government considered the issue carefully and, advised by the report of the high level group, decided to bring this legislation forward. We took this decision because all Governments, both now and in the future, must be able to examine important public issues, to have full and frank debate between Ministers and reach a final collective decision which is taken in the best interests of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I do not accept that it is in the public interest that the Government's consideration of issues should be weakened or that it is in the public interest that records relating to Government decisions should be released in a manner which undermines those decisions or, at least, leads them to being re-opened. It is the Government's firm view that the existing Act affects the way we do our business and it must, therefore, be amended. I will explain to the House why the Government arrived at this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The Government, in this Bill, is not attempting to repeal the Freedom of Information Act or to introduce major restrictions on the public's right of access which could have the same effect. It would have been open to the Government to do this, but we did not do so. We are not proposing repeal or the blunting of the legislation. The Government is aware that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 has played an important part in public service reform in Ireland. This contribution was explicitly recognised in the recent PA Consultants' report on the strategic management initiative. It has also made a wider contribution to Irish public life.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The public now has access to all types of records. People can get papers about a wide range of economic and social policies being implemented by Departments and public sector organisations of all kinds. On the basis of this information, they can find out what the policies are intended to achieve, they can analyse the results of these policies and they can comment and criticise. As a result of the Act, the quality of public debate in Ireland has improved beyond all recognition. Debates on issues are much more informed than they used to be. There is now more and better coverage of public policy and its impact on our society and economy. This has been of major importance in supporting and extending the democratic process in Ireland. All Deputies will welcome this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The legislation has also been of major benefit to individuals. People can now get access to per sonal information held on them by public bodies. This simple, straightforward step has done much to ensure that public organisations improve their services and that they are more aware of the needs of individual members of the public. The Government has played an important part in securing these progressive developments and has been happy to do so. It has made significant extensions to the remit of the original Act. It was first extended to local authorities and to health boards, then to voluntary hospitals and subsequently to numerous other State agencies, bodies and institutions, including those in the enterprise, broadcasting and third level education sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">When it came into force, the Freedom of Information Act covered just 67 bodies. Today, it covers approximately 370. By extending freedom of information throughout the public service, the Government has ensured that it has become a permanent and valuable feature of public administration in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_507" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_867">We have also committed ourselves to a continuing programme of extensions with the aim that by the end of 2005 all bodies, organisations and groups appropriate for inclusion will be covered. The Government has also expanded the scope of the Act. For example, regulations have been made to allow for the release of records to the parents and guardians of minors and persons with a disability and to the relatives and representatives of the deceased.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Usage of the Freedom of Information Act bears out its important role. Since April 1998, tens of thousands of requests have been made to public bodies and the large majority have been granted in full or in part. Of course, the success of the Act cannot be judged solely by such statistics. It was anticipated before the Act was introduced that it would help to encourage the release, on an informal administrative basis, of information which would previously not have been readily available. A recent example of this can be seen in the move by third level education institutions to release students' examination scripts without requiring students to invoke the Act. In summary, the Act has served to improve public administration and to heighten public confidence in public institutions. The Government is happy to see this progress take place and will be working to see that these developments continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">However, we are also committed to effective government. While freedom of information is valuable and important, it cannot be the main factor in deciding how the Government conducts its business. This is why the Government has decided to bring this Bill forward. The central purpose of this Bill is to protect the workings of  Government. It does this by making the protection of Cabinet records mandatory, by protecting communications between Ministers which deal with issues under consideration by the Government, by protecting records relating to the working of committees of officials and advisers assisting the Government in carrying out its work, by extending the period of protection for Government records from five to ten years and by giving Secretaries General the power to certify that a deliberative process is continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">All organisations have the right to decide how to organise their business. The Government is no different. In fact, making certain that the Government has the ability to organise its business properly and efficiently must be, without doubt, one of the main public interests in any society. It cannot be in the public interest to weaken or undermine the Government's ability to take decisions for and on behalf of the people who elected it.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The work of Government is complex. In reaching decisions on economic and social policies, the Government must look at different alternatives and approaches, debate these freely and reach a collective decision on behalf of the community. This is a difficult process. It has to be if we are to take account of the diverse needs and interests of a modern society. Deputies understand how the process works but it is important to be clear about what happens in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The collective responsibility of the Government for decisions is not just established around the Cabinet table after a short discussion. Different Departments prepare memoranda for the Government on the issues which must be decided. These memoranda are circulated for comment to all Ministers and their Departments. Often there is correspondence between Ministers and between officials about issues which affect, either directly or indirectly, what is about to come before the Government. On other occasions, this correspondence is supplemented by bilateral meetings of Ministers or officials to try to get consensus on the issues which need to be settled. When something has been discussed initially at the Cabinet, the Government may, before taking its final decision, refer the matter to a committee of Ministers, who are asked to examine the issues in more detail and report back. These committees of Ministers may be assisted by advisers or departmental officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Of course, what happens at the Cabinet meeting where the final decision is taken is important. That is where the Ministers of the Government elected by the people discuss the issues and collectively reach their final decisions. Many of these decisions, however, can only be taken at Cabinet because this wider process of discussion and consultation between Ministers and their senior officials and advisors has already taken place. Many of the issues are clarified and analysed well before that final decision is taken. Very often, at  least some element of consensus has been established as a result of this preliminary work. Even if a consensus is not established, at least the Government knows what has to be agreed before the decision can be taken. If this process is not protected by the measures set out in the Government's Bill, the workings of Government have the potential to be seriously undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">It is easy to see what could happen if we do not make certain that there is a reasonable opportunity for a full analysis and debate of the kind I have outlined. If Ministers know that their opinions could become public knowledge quite soon, they might well decide that they should only make their views known around the Government table. Ministers who were not directly involved in the issues might decide that it was unwise to express their real opinion. In time, it is likely that senior officials and advisors would take the same approach. Clearly, if this were to happen, it would make it all the harder to develop and establish the real, practical consensus which is necessary for the exercise of collective Government responsibility, especially with complex economic or social issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">There would be other negative effects. The nature and scope of the advice available to Ministers and the Government would become seriously limited. With most if not all the attention being placed on the Cabinet meeting itself, the prior consultation between Ministers and between officials would be reduced in importance and therefore in effectiveness. Not only would it become more difficult to reach agreement at the Cabinet, but the quality of the advice available to the Government would be affected. It is almost inevitable that the people involved in the process would start to confine their views and advice to the safer, middle-of-the-road options to avoid possible criticism later on.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Without the kind of preparatory work which is a central part of the working of Government, there is no reason to think that the actual discussions at the Cabinet would be as wide-ranging and as detailed as they need to be if the Government is to decide on the best possible policies. This has to mean that the whole basis for Government decision-making can be damaged.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_878">It is my strong view that this should not be allowed to happen. Protecting the workings of Government to ensure that the best advice is available, to ensure that Ministers can discuss what should be done freely and thoroughly, and then take and implement their decisions, is very definitely in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I make no apology for the fact that the establishment and protection of an appropriate space  for Government deliberations is what this Bill aims to achieve and this is why the Bill gives mandatory protection to Cabinet records, restricts access to communications between Ministers dealing with matters under consideration by the Government, and protects records relating to the working of committees of officials and advisors assisting the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">To make certain that there is no doubt about the nature and extent of a deliberative process which might be affected by the release of documents, the Government is also proposing to give Secretaries General the power to issue a certificate stating that a deliberative process is continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The framers of the original Act recognised that a period of protection for Government records was required. They included an exemption period of five years in the Act. However, it has become clear that five years is not an adequate period for this purpose. The high level group established by the Government to review the operation of the Act stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_882">As experience is gained in the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, it is evident that a five-year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is too short. It does not give Ministers the assurance that they require to commit views freely to the record if those views are to be divulged in such a relatively short space of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending to the Dáil that the restriction of five years for Government records should be raised to ten years. There is no point in protecting the operation of Government in the way I have outlined, if the records dealing with our decisions are not protected for an appropriate period.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">We have heard a good deal in recent weeks about international comparisons and there are a number of points I want to make on this issue. Despite many of the comments made in recent weeks, it is the case that a ten-year limit still leaves Ireland with a relatively open approach to freedom of information. In other jurisdictions, such limits range from ten to 30 years. Canada, for example, operates a blanket restriction for 20 years on a wide range of records under the general heading of Cabinet confidences.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">There are other important lessons which have to be drawn by looking at what happens abroad. I have heard much about freedom of information in Scandinavian countries. The freedom of information legislation in these countries, particularly Sweden, is often held up as the model that other governments should follow. It is true that the Swedish system is very open. Anyone has the right to request a public body for any record or document that it has, but it is instructive to look at how the Swedish Government actually operates. No memoranda of the detailed kind pre pared in Ireland are submitted to Ministers. No minutes are kept of the discussions held in Cabinet. In effect, the Swedish Government meets formally to endorse what is already an agreed decision. Discussions and consultations take place elsewhere and, as I understand it, they are quite often informal.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">This is not a criticism. I am sure that the Swedish approach meets the needs of its Government and has grown out of the administrative practices developed over the years. However, our system in Ireland is different. A greater emphasis is placed on more formal consultation and debate and it is the protection of this process which is the basis of the Government's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">There are a number of other issues about the Bill which I want to bring to the attention of Deputies. The Bill provides for the introduction of up-front fees to be paid by requesters. I believe that such fees are long overdue. There is a very significant administrative cost to FOI. A recent internal survey in my own Department estimated that, on average, FOI requests required eight hours of working time at a cost of €425 to the taxpayer. I understand that in other Departments similar surveys have produced higher estimates of the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">There are provisions for the charging of fees in the existing Act, but these have not operated as was originally intended. The Act states that a fee must be charged for an FOI request unless the request is for personal information or exceptional circumstances apply. In practice, the opposite has been happening, with charges being the exception rather than the rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">A couple of years ago, one requester sought access to the diaries of a number of civil servants and Ministers. There were hundreds of records. Every diary, comprising thousands of pages of documentation, had to be read through, assessed and considered for release, with personal or sensitive material deleted. The cost of processing that request alone was probably well over €10,000, but the cost to the requester, including photocopying, amounted to around €600.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Deputies may recall a case that came to light within the first year of FOI where an individual made 466 requests, was responsible for 101 internal review applications and 35 appeals to the Information Commissioner. Some 194 of these requests were made to a single public body. As the authors of a technical report on the Act noted in relation to this case:</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Neither those who campaigned for FOI, nor the majority of requesters who make reasonable use of the Act, would have expected that a single individual would, through extreme usage of the Act, cost the taxpayer well in excess of £100,000 or €127,000 in an eight-month period following its introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">FOI does not come cheap. A single FOI request can take many hours to process. This involves the  basics of acknowledging the request, talking to the requester to ensure the request is adequately focused and understood, estimating search and retrieval time required, locating relevant records, examining each record line by line for any exempt matter, and considering public interest arguments for and against release.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Where third party information is involved, the process can be even more complex, with the requirements to locate and contact third parties, issue formal consultation letters, consider submissions and notify appeal rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The Oireachtas recognised that a fee should be imposed for FOI requests as a reflection of this burden. The difficulty, as I have said, is that the fees have not always been charged.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">The true cost of FOI is not therefore recognised.

          <p eId="para_907">Despite media reports the level of fees has not been decided. I will give careful consideration to the setting of these fees and, in doing so, will be careful to strike a balance between the burden and cost of administering the legislation and the need to allow people to continue to have access to information. I should stress that the Government does not favour the charging of an up-front fee for personal information and the Bill explicitly precludes this possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">In the course of the Seanad debate, I also indicated my willingness to look at the section of the Bill dealing with fees so that there would be scope for varying the level of fees for certain categories of requester, for example, disadvantaged people. However, I also made clear my belief that every citizen should make some small contribution, however minimal or nominal. This leads to an appreciation of the service. Where it is absent, the service can be abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">As I said in the Seanad, another area that I will examine with a view to bringing forward an amendment relates to the scope for relatives of minors and disabled persons and the next-of-kin of deceased persons to use the Act fully.</p>

          <p eId="para_912">This would include, for example, giving a right to the parents of a minor or of a disabled person to have personal information amended where the information is incorrect, incomplete or misleading. It would also include giving a right to such persons to have the reasons for a decision taken by a public body which affected the relative explained.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I would also like to address the issue of personal information. Deputies will note that section 4 of the Bill amends section 6 of the main Act by substituting the word "contain" for the words "relate to". The purpose of this section is to bring clarity to an area which is currently far from certain. The need for the inclusion of this provision in the Bill has arisen as a result of the outcome of a High Court case on this issue. The High Court judgment states that the test to be applied to determine whether a record "relates to" personal information is whether there is a "sufficiently substantial link" between the requester's personal information, as defined in the Act, and the record in question. This has led to a certain amount of confusion in public bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Public bodies have records which contain all sorts of personal information about people. Information on record about the person's name, age, address, education, employment history and the person's dealings with the organisation is exactly the sort of information that the requester seeking personal information will want to receive. It is perfectly clear what this means. However, it is not clear what records "relating to" personal information means. As well as records about the person, the public body will have also other records which might or might not be considered "to relate" to those records. It is even possible that general notes or documents about the filing arrangements for the holding of personal records would be covered by the existing section on the basis that they "relate to" those personal records.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">When dealing with a statutory right of access to personal information, we need to be clear about what we mean. In short, we need a formulation that everyone – people seeking the information and those charged with deciding whether there is a right to the information – can understand. Personal information is defined in a clear and comprehensive way in the Act. The change being made by the Government ties the right of access to personal information to this definition, thereby serving to clarify a provision which, if left unchanged, carries significant potential for confusion, inconsistency and dissatisfaction for all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Government has always been, and continues to be, fully committed to the access, by individual citizens, to their respective personal records. I assure Deputies that the position in relation to an individual's right of access to personal information is not being changed by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The Government must be able to carry out its business in an orderly way. All organisations have the right to decide how to carry out their business. The Government is no different. The Government has considered this Bill very carefully. It is not a rushed measure. We set up a high level group of Secretaries General to examine all aspects of the existing freedom of information legislation. The group looked very carefully at the working of the Act and made a number of recommendations now being implemented in the new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Freedom of information is important, but at the same time it cannot be allowed to interfere with how the Government does its business efficiently in the interest of the whole community. The processes of Government are too important for the real public interest of our society to allow them to be undermined. No organisation, particularly a Government, can be expected to accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">As Deputies will be aware, the Information Commissioner, on 11 March 2003, published a report which raised a number of questions about the Government's proposals. This report has  been examined by my officials in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and while the report has been a useful contribution to the debate on this Bill, I am fully satisfied that any concerns raised in it about the Government's Bill are not justified. As regards the technical amendments proposed by the Information Commissioner, these had already been submitted to and discussed with the FOI central policy unit of my Department and a number of them were taken on board in drafting the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">The Freedom of Information Act has made a major contribution to public life in Ireland and will continue to do so. I assure Deputies that the Government will continue to work to extend the benefits of FOI. The Bill is a sensible, practical measure designed to allow the Government to work effectively while maintaining reasonable public access to records. I am happy it gets the balance right on freedom of information. The Government will be able to do its business properly while people will still have access to information, particularly personal information that may be held on them. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

He said that Fianna Fáil believes that the presumption should be in favour of disclosure. He described this as an inadequate Bill. He said that any information that is exempted must be included in a confidentiality list with description sufficient to enable the public to challenge its inclusion in the list. Deputy O'Donnell, who was far-seeing, said about this Bill that she could envisage the Government of the day, which has possession of certain information being determined to plead the public interest to withhold that information. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, usually so garrulous in this House, does not seem to be present to hear about the freedom of information that is being removed.</p>

No effort was made to tap his experience in drafting this legislation. We have had the extraordinary sight of a public official being forced to prepare a parallel submission to the Oireachtas to protect the public interest from ill-considered legislation. What thanks did he get from the Government benches? He was accused of exceeding his rights. There was a crude attempt by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to muzzle an important public official. Fortunately for this House, he was a public official not appointed by Government but independently appointed by the Oireachtas who could withstand that sort of arrogant treatment from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That official could withstand arrogant treatment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister has not come back to the House to withdraw the insults he dished out so freely to those who were not here to defend themselves, but he should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Not one citizens' group has been consulted about this legislation. Deputy McDaid was particularly eloquent on the role of citizens' groups in the freedom of information area and commented on how poor the legislation presented by the then rainbow coalition Government was in that regard. However, he sits side by side with a Minister who has stamped on the rights of ordinary people to have their say on this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">This Bill rebalances the rights enshrined in the original legislation. The only consultation carried out by the Government has been with Ministers and some senior advisers. There has not been one example offered of the existing legislation harming the decision-making process of Government to justify the far-reaching changes now being made. None have been offered tonight either; all we had were speculative comments about potential issues. We have had the Bill for five years  and there is no evidence that decision-making has collapsed, that the Cabinet has had lengthy debates without conclusions or that Ministers have been unwilling to put their views on paper. When officials were asked frankly if Ministers were now unwilling to put their views on papers, they said no – that they had no experience of that happening. However, we are supposed to accept that changes have to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Worst of all, the Bill is being steamrolled through the House. It had only been published three days when it was brought to the Seanad and it has been guillotined every step of the way. The Minister thinks that drowning the Dáil in debating time, late at night and early in the morning, means he is allowing proper, mature reflection on the issue. However, that is showing arrogance and contempt for the House. Those who sat through the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service – none of whom are here, unfortunately – know this shows contempt for the House. Many citizens' groups also attended those committee meetings to have their voices heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The only reason for the blind pursuit of the Bill is that the Minister is convinced the public does not understand it and that it will not cause difficulty for his backbenchers. He is wrong: this will cause profound difficulty for his backbenchers. The Minister fooled the people in the general election. He went to the country on the basis that everything could be done and he made promises to end hospital waiting lists, to provide 2,000 extra gardaí and to provide €10 billion for a health strategy. Those promises were designed to fool people and in June 2002, a fateful month for the Government, he suddenly decided the money was gone. All the partying he had encouraged could no longer continue. His stroke was to pull the wool over people's eyes but they will not forgive him for that, nor will they forgive him for trying to bury the evidence of that deceit.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">That is what the Bill is about. It is about protecting political hides and burying evidence the public has a right to hear. This has nothing to do with giving the country good Government but is intended to protect cliques and cabals in the way Government is run. That should be in the open and information should be available to everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">I was proud to be part of the Government which introduced the Freedom of Information Act, which was the start of a welcome reform of the political orthodoxy in Ireland. The Act threw out the old, secret ways of doing things and it was important to give newly-defined political rights to citizens and to put political obligations on Ministers. That is what the Bill did. It came out of a murky past we all know about, a past which has caused the establishment of many tribunals at significant cost to the taxpayer. Here is a Government going back to those old ways, removing the  pillars of a new political order to protect its position.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The Freedom of Information Act is not a play thing of Government to be changed at the whim of the Minister or his colleagues, including the backbenchers who did not hear a thing about it. The Act should only be changed for grave reasons and potential embarrassment or discomfiture of Ministers is not reason enough to change the legislation. A Government will show this sort of public contempt for people, changing the rules of the game to suit itself, at its peril. That sort of behaviour has brought contempt on people in the House yet here we see it in its grossest form.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">The Freedom of Information Act is not just about giving people access to personal records. It is about the right of citizens to know how decisions are being taken on their behalf and how they are being governed. The Act was carefully framed on its introduction and was designed to usher in a new era which would give citizens greater opportunities to participate in and know of the decisions being taken on their behalf. It was founded on five fundamental pillars, such as the presumption of openness and that records would only be refused if there were compelling reasons against their release. Exemptions would only be allowed where a specified harm was likely to occur. There would be a right of appeal when a head of section exercised his or her rights under law to refuse an application for information and there would be circumscribed opportunities for the assertion of blanket exemptions from the release of information – there would also be built-in checks and balances to deal with such cases. There would also be a right to make requests without a fee upfront, with a person only paying for the cost incurred by his or her request.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The Government proposes to change all of those pillars and the rights of citizens will be fundamentally altered by the proposed changes. Why is this being done? That is the key question. Few Members can believe the changes have anything to do with offering better Government. I doubt Deputy O'Donnell is one of those Members and I will take an interruption if she wants to offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">These changes have a great deal to do with the Government wanting to use a large majority it did not have in the last Dáil to close off information which could be potentially embarrassing to Ministers. That is the agenda being pursued and in June 2002, the Government and its arrogant majority quickly moved to commence this process. It did not begin a consultation process, but a process involving insiders to offer a cover for what it was doing. There was no balanced consultation. A high level group was ostensibly meant to review the operation of the Act but within days of its appointment it dropped all pretence of reviewing the Act's operation, focusing exclusively instead on the protection of Ministers. That became the group's unwritten brief.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">It is wrong for Ministers to push independent public servants of integrity to the fore to defend their actions. Those people have immense integrity but it is clear from the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that they did not expect their advice to be the sole input for the Government. They saw their advice as coming from a partial group, on one side of the argument; the advice might have been in the public interest but nonetheless came from a group which represented public bodies and not citizens. They expected the Minister to have much wider consultations with other interests so that this would be a process of integrity they could stand over, but they were sorely deceived in thinking that would happen. There was no intention of having that wider discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">If evidence were needed for the narrow political motivation behind this measure, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform quickly provided it. He made a blatant attempt to muzzle the Information Commissioner when the issue was first debated in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The Government, in its haste to bounce these changes through the House, does not even know what is in the Bill. It is manifestly untrue for the Taoiseach and the Minister to state that the Bill does not in any way interfere with the right of individuals to access their personal records. Access to records for persons who believe they have been harmed in the past by the State will be fundamentally altered. Such persons will no longer have access to reports related to the activity which damaged them and will only get access to such reports if they make specific reference to their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service heard from the One in Four group, which represents those abused in institutions of the State, that its members' right of access to records is fundamentally altered by the Bill. In his speech, the Minister did not even pay the group the courtesy of addressing the concerns it raised, so little value does he attach to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">A parent seeking access to records regarding an issue which is before any form of legal inquiry will be refused access under the new provisions. These are not trivial changes, but ones which will intimately affect some of the people most hurt by Government and State over the years. If the Minister were to bother consulting some of the Government backbenchers who sat through the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, he would find my points are accurate. He will hear their concerns even if they are not here tonight and he had better respond to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The Bill dramatically changes public access to records. Under the current Act, which will be butchered by the Minister, a record had to fall into one or other of several categories if it was to be exempted. It either had to be submitted to  Cabinet, one from which the Minister's statement in Cabinet could be inferred, put together solely for a meeting of Government or inherent to an ongoing deliberative process. Even then, such records were not given class exemptions and refusals were always open to appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The fundamental changes now proposed profoundly alter the opportunity for citizens to find out how decisions are made on their behalf. Gone is the presumption of openness unless a record is likely to cause harm. In its place a blanket of secrecy is imposed on every record related to the policy of Ministers. In addition, an unchallengeable certification system, which can spread the code of secrecy to every public body in the State, is to be operated by Secretaries General. Gone is the opportunity to appeal decisions of refusal in this area of governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The presumption of openness, the hallmark of the original Act so criticised by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, will be removed in its entirety. It will be removed with no right of appeal for all public bodies in a deliberative process, virtually all ministerial communication on policy issues, all information before tribunals, memoranda to Government, all communication with the diplomatic service and all committees certified as assisting Cabinet. By reversing the onus of proof, it dilutes openness in respect of every request to a public body concerning a matter under deliberation. Instead of needing evidence of harm to refuse the release of a record, a public official will be able to refuse simply on the basis that in his or her view the release of the record in question would be of no public benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Act will also be fundamentally changed by the indiscriminate set of exemptions stretching far beyond Cabinet discussions, which the Minister seeks to introduce. He wants to throw the veil of secrecy wide so the tracks are well covered. The considerations which give rise to a refusal will become more difficult to ascertain under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">The old ways are most certainly reasserting themselves. The Bill offers a new definition of Government which extends secrecy. This definition was described by the Information Commissioner as "much more far-reaching and constitutionally unrecognisable". Once certified, an advisory committee will get all the protection of Cabinet Ministers in protecting the records it generates, an extraordinary measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">None of the tests of reasonableness and no time limits or other measures will be imposed in respect of this new certification process. The head of a public body who decides to release a record will need to be satisfied the public good is served not only in respect of his own agency, but also in respect of every other public body. I have never heard of a more far-reaching pretext for refusal of records. It is unrealistic to expect the head of  one body to be able to recognise the needs of other public bodies and be certain they will not be adversely affected by the release of records.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Minister is taking a profoundly conservative approach to the release of information. I suspect he does not even know the details of many of the provisions of the Bill, which go far beyond the changes recommended by the high level group. This was evident to anybody present at the proceedings of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. In regard to the protection of records other than those directly submitted to Cabinet, for example, the high level group recommended refusal to be used sparingly and only in the appropriate context. None of these qualifications appears in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The high level group explicitly disagreed with the idea of giving groups of officials the same protection as enjoyed by the Government. It did not recommend introducing the obligation on public bodies to anticipate the secrecy needs of other bodies when making decisions on requests. It envisaged that the protection of ministerial communication would be restricted to tightly defined circumstances, not the much broader definition provided by the Minister. It did not recommend that briefings associated with parliamentary questions be exempted from release. While members of the Government have relied heavily on the group, clinging to it as the source of defence for their proposals, the Bill goes far beyond anything the group countenanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform described the members of the high level group as persons of the highest integrity and independence. Persons of integrity they certainly are, but the individuals in question would not even claim to be independent in respect of freedom of information. They are clearly on one side of an important transaction between the citizen and the official bodies which act on the citizen's behalf and cannot, therefore, be regarded as impartial or the sole interpreter of what might be in the public interest with regard to this relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">In a telling sentence on page 12 of his report, the Information Commissioner was forced to observe, "it is clear that my view of the Freedom of Information Act, as originally framed, differs from that of the High Level Group."  In this regard, he was hotly contesting the opinion expressed by the high level group that the overarching policy of section 19 of the Act is that Cabinet records should be exempt from access for a reasonable period and that this is necessary if the Cabinet process and the exercise of collective responsibility are not to be constrained. There was no such presumption in the original Act. The group advocated a system of mandatory exemptions which was not a feature of the Act so roundly criticised by the Minister of State at the  Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The Information Commissioner was right in pointing out that the Bill flies in the face of the whole thrust of the Freedom of Information Act. I note the Minister again contemptuously throws aside the serious critique of the Bill presented by the Information Commissioner. The Minister's contempt for a report provided by the Oireachtas, on which we have had hearings, and the fact that he did not have the decency even to listen to the Information Commissioner augur poorly for the many hours of debate we will spend on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The crucial question the House has to decide is how far should the public rights to information be compromised to protect Cabinet collective responsibility and the obligation of Ministers to properly prepare memoranda for submission to Cabinet. These are solemn duties the Minister undertook on his appointment. It is for Ministers to protect the collective responsibility of Cabinet. It is not a penalty to impose on the public in respect of its rights. Ministers cannot shirk their obligations by saying the only way to enforce collective responsibility is by making sure the whole system is closed down from public view. That is a contemptuous view and there is no evidence to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">In this case, Ministers have known for the past five years that they operated under an obligation to start releasing records on the 21st of next month in respect of the decisions they took and now that the time for examination of the quality of their decisions is coming up under law, and there is an opportunity for the public to see how business has been conducted on its behalf by these Ministers, they are running for cover. Deputy O'Donnell was right. She spoke for everyone in this House and I hope she has the opportunity to do so again during this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">The question that must be asked is who is responsible for policing collective responsibility. Is it Ministers or the public? How far must the public's right to information be compromised in order to bolster these Ministers who will be deflected from their duty so easily? Is it to be totally protected? Is the public to see nothing? Is there to be no appeal? Are they to be protected for a decade? Is it to be extended to every scrap of ministerial communication to any group assembled in the name of a Minister? I believe not. This is bad legislation. What tests should we apply if we are being asked to make such a fundamental change?</p>
          <p eId="para_967">What is remarkable about the testimony of the high level group and the testimony of the Minister in this debate is that not a shred of evidence has been submitted to suggest that the existing Act has damaged Government decision making processes. No example was given of where a Minister failed to submit his or her views. There is no example of evidence that Cabinet procedures had become cumbersome and long-winded, with all decisions being left until the Cabinet meets. Not a single example of any harmful release of information has been cited by Ministers in the course of this debate, yet we will fundamentally change the basis on which citizens have rights to information. How can that be squared with Ministers' responsibilities? They know they are responsible for this but the examination is upon them and they want to change the rules. They are willing to use their big majority to force this measure through the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">I note that some commentators in the press say that the extension of time is perhaps understandable. That case is entirely unproven and it deserves the most careful assessment by this House. The five-year rule was intended as a discipline and was inserted in the public interest.  There was good reason for the presumption of openness in the original Act. It has clear public advantages. It means that the motivation for decisions taken by Ministers must stand up to scrutiny when they are revealed five years later. It means that Ministers must be careful when they make decisions, that they must do so on the basis of the best advice available and that the public will see the advice they used. It means that the public will come to understand how decisions are reached on its behalf. It means that if information comes out, they can still apply for the protections that exist if damage results from the release of that information, and there are ample protections in the legislation to protect memoranda that could be genuinely damaging to the public interest. There are exemptions for security, defence, international relations and umpteen different reasons in the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I am far from convinced by the argument put forward and the picture of quivering Ministers fearing the adverse portrayal of their views. These Ministers are contemptible. The arguments have been made entirely without evidence. They infer that Ministers will make worse decisions if they are mindful of public opinion in five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">This Bill has little to do with delivering better Government. It arises from a view that the public cannot be trusted with so-called arguments and that the Government knows best.</p>

That is what has made this Government afraid of freedom of information and what has made it run for cover. We are living in dangerous times.

          <from>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_986">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue on the  Adjournment. A stand-off has been going on for three weeks at the ADM plant in Ringaskiddy and concern has been expressed to me by families of the workers involved. The stress of being out of work after working non-stop for 20 years without a strike is terrible. It creates an air of uncertainty and a strong sense of unease.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">Some workers feel they have been locked out while others, who have agreed to new work arrangements, feel it is unjustifiable that they have been temporarily laid off. This plant, which produces citric acid, was purchased from Pfizer's. The workers retained the conditions that applied in that company and all agreements were honoured by the new owners. The workers, as a result, gave loyal service so it is understandable that ADM now has an ageing workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">There have been ongoing problems with branch two workers of SIPTU for a number of years. The company, in trying to introduce alternative rosters, is conscious of setting guidelines for a generation of new workers but the "take it or leave it" attitude exemplified was contrary to all human resource procedures adopted by the company to date. The operators who have been locked out are anxious to negotiate – they are willing to discuss new working arrangements, they do not want to be inflexible. They are grateful for the employment they have been given by the company and they are anxious to be involved in normal trade union negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">Unfortunately rumour abounds and there is an undercurrent suggesting that there is over-production of citric acid in the world and that it suits the company to close temporarily to save money while placing workers' families in financial straits.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">I represent most of those workers and my interest is to save their jobs. I exhort all those involved to get back to work and restore harmony in a company that is held in the highest esteem in County Cork. The Minister of State and the Tánaiste have the power and capacity to ensure progress is made to reach acceptable, fair and just solutions to this problem. Given the uncertainty abroad and the fears expressed by the workers and their families, we as a Government must be seen to be actively involved in ensuring people get back to the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">Progress is never made in a stand-off. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State are well aware that unless the parties are brought to the table, 170 jobs could be lost. They must actively seek ways and means where both parties to the dispute can come together for meaningful negotiations to ensure progress is made and people can go back to work in a company that has provided reliable, pensionable employment. That company will then retain the high status it has enjoyed since the plant was purchased in 1990.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_992">The Tánaiste and I are extremely concerned about this dispute, which has resulted in the temporary closure of the company since 10  March 2003. It is particularly undesirable that all 170 jobs at the plant could be at risk as a result of a dispute. The loss of those jobs would be a major blow to the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The company sought agreement to introduce a restructuring plan which involved new rostering arrangements. The new arrangements were due to come into effect in early March 2003. The conciliation service of the Labour Relations Commission received an urgent request to intervene between management and staff representatives due to difficulties in introducing the new arrangements. Accordingly, on 5 March 2003 an officer of the commission met representatives of staff and management. The outcome of these discussions was rejected by SIPTU. The company then announced its intention to close the plant for a temporary period to facilitate a review of plant operations. Operations at the Ringaskiddy plant ceased on 10 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">SIPTU immediately requested the Labour Relations Commission to refer the dispute to a full hearing of the Labour Court. However, in response, the company indicated that it was not in a position to agree to this request at this time. The continuation of the dispute is particularly disappointing in light of the failure of management and unions to achieve a solution to the impasse, despite the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The Tánaiste has stated in this House on previous occasions that it would not be appropriate to intervene in such industrial disputes. Instead, both parties involved in this dispute should utilise the expert services of the dispute settling machinery to avoid continuing disruption and hardship. The experience and expertise of these services are available free of charge to disputing parties and offer them the best avenue for resolving their differences.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">It is ultimately the responsibility of the parties concerned to ensure that agreement is reached. Settlement of industrial disputes requires the goodwill of both sides and often requires compromise by both parties. I take this opportunity to encourage both sides to demonstrate their goodwill and desire to resolve the impasse by renewing dialogue.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_545">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_997">All the information I have about the issue I am about to raise was found under the Freedom of Information Act. The Government decided in 2000 to decentralise the Passport Office. The areas of choice the Department was charged to investigate were south County Louth – Drogheda – and north County Dublin, with the various factors involved being weighed up for each location. The most important factors were proximity to the airport and transport to the city centre. The relocation of more than 200 people from Dublin city centre to Drogheda or north County Dublin would be a welcome addition to my constituency and town.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">The Department was looking for a ready-made 25,000 square foot building. Such buildings were examined in Drogheda, Swords and other parts of County Dublin. The one place that was not looked at was Balbriggan because it had no such building. It was not on the cards that Balbriggan would be the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Reading the minutes of the meetings held in the Department and with other Departments, however, we find out that arising from a political initiative involving the Minister of State at the time, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Balbriggan was brought into play. The Department stated firmly there was no case to be made for Balbriggan, however wonderful that town might be, because there was no facility available for examination at that location. No building existed and, therefore, it could not be considered. Again, the question was posed: why not Balbriggan? The answer was that, even if what was being proposed was a greenfield site, there was no planning permission for such a site. Even if it were to be built with the greatest possible haste, having got that planning permission, it would be delivered one year late. In other words, the Department wanted a building there and then and, since the Balbriggan facility involved a delay of one year, it was not acceptable to Department officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">At that point, the trail goes cold because the documents which have not been released to me relate to the reason the Department decided in favour of Balbriggan. I hope the Minister of State has the answer to that for me and my constituents. The reality is that if the Department ultimately decided on a greenfield site, its brief should have included consideration of greenfield sites in Drogheda and Balbriggan. What would be the difference between such sites, if they existed? The one in Balbriggan had neither planning permission nor any building on it. In Drogheda, we had a building of 25,000 sq. ft. with which the Department was not entirely satisfied. We also had a greenfield site with planning permission for not just one, but two units of 25,000 sq. ft. and one of 49,000 sq. ft.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">However, nobody chose to make inquiries in that regard. There was a political failure on the part of this Government, the Minister from the constituency concerned, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his party colleague, Deputy Kirk. They failed to grasp this wonderful opportunity for the town of Drogheda to secure a magnificent, first class, state-of-the-art passport office involving over 200 jobs and I charge them with that failure. Nobody in the Department or on the political side looked at the issues in relation to Drogheda. That failure in relation to my town rests ultimately with this Government. What have we got from this Government? There is no funding for a swimming pool. The Government has, very kindly, provided toll roads directly at the entrance to our town. It has ignored Drogheda in the context of the spatial strategy. It has given us an incinerator, thanks to the policy of the then Minister for the  Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey. The passport office, apparently, is not for our town. That situation is simply not acceptable. I expect an adequate explanation from the Minister of State for the serious situation which has arisen whereby a town was turned down although it had a choice of buildings and a greenfield site to offer. A passport office and related jobs were lost forever to our town. We are deeply concerned over this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I am not sure whether a contract for the project has been signed as yet. It is my understanding that it has not been signed and that may be the reason further information was not released to me, as it was part of the Department's process. There is still time for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to intervene and secure this office for Drogheda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">The matter raised by Deputy O'Dowd relates to a major project which the Department of Foreign Affairs has commenced to upgrade and modernise Ireland's passport service. There has been a significant increase in the number of passport applications over the last ten years, reflecting the increased levels of prosperity in the country and the existing systems used in the Passport Office are reaching the limits of their capacity. There is, therefore, an urgent need to improve both the technological systems and the business processes. In doing so, the Department intends to take advantage of significant advances in passport issuing technology in recent years to increase the security of the passport booklet and provide a better service to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">The project was launched in August 2001 with the publication of a request for tender in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union.</i> A number of proposals was received and, after a careful evaluation process, the successful bidder was selected last June. Following extensive contract negotiations which reflected both the scale and complexity of the project, work commenced in January of this year. The project is due to be completed in the autumn of next year. A feature of this project is the need for a new passport production facility to house the complex machinery that will be used to print the new passports. The public offices of the Passport Office will continue to operate at Molesworth Street, Dublin, and South Mall, Cork. What is involved, therefore, is the relocation of part of the Passport Office's operation and not the entire office as suggested by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">In the context of the Government's programme on decentralisation, it was agreed with the Department of Finance that the new passport production facility would be located in the north County Dublin/south County Louth area. As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of offices for Departments is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. The Department of Foreign Affairs requested the Office of Public Works to  source a premises in the area agreed with the Department of Finance. On foot of this request, the Office of Public Works, in January 2002, invited estate agents to identify suitable office accommodation in the north County Dublin/south County Louth areas that would be available for occupation by September 2002, which was the best estimate at that time of the date on which the accommodation would be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Many properties and locations were examined by officials of the Department and the Office of Public Works. One was a factory that made telecommunications equipment. The offices attached to the factory were not totally unsuitable but the offices and the factory floor were an integrated whole. The Passport Office required office space but did not need manufacturing assembly space. The factory space could not have been reconfigured to meet the needs of the Passport Office and would, in any event, have been too large.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Some other properties surveyed were located in isolated places without convenient public transport. These were not considered suitable as many of the staff in the Passport Office do not have their own private transport. Some of the office spaces examined were too small to meet the needs of the Passport Office. Others were designed in such a way that it would have been difficult to reconfigure them to make them suitable for the Passport Office. The planned building at Balbriggan had the advantage that it could be custom built to cater for the requirements of the Passport Office. Its location close to Dublin Airport was also considered to be an advantage since the production of all passports, including those applied for by Irish citizens abroad, will be centralised in the new production facility. It was also, importantly, the best value for money of the properties considered for the new office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">At the time of the initial search, the Balbriggan proposal was not considered to be a viable option because it appeared that the building proposed, which had not got to planning stage, would not have been available on time. In the event, because of the complexity of the project and the fact that the successful bidder was leading a consortium that comprised a number of different companies providing different elements of the project, the contract negotiations took longer than expected. As a result, the timeframe for the delivery of the new passport premises was extended to September 2003. The Office of Public Works was informed of this and asked to continue its search for a suitable premises for the new passport production facility. The developers of the Fingal Bay business centre at Balbriggan, a public private partnership of Fingal County Council and Howard Holdings, received planning permission on 27 March 2002 for a building that could meet the requirements of the new passport office and submitted a proposal for a stand-alone building to the Office of Public Works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The Balbriggan proposal, together with a number of others in the north County Dublin area,  was carefully assessed by experts in the Office of Public Works and a report on the suitability of four possible premises for the new passport facility was forwarded to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 2 July 2002. This report was examined within the Department and a recommendation was submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 22 July 2002. This recommendation was that the building proposed at the Fingal Bay business centre was the most suitable for the needs of the Passport Office, subject to the provision of assurances by the developers that the building would be completed on time to meet the requirements of the project. The Office of Public Works was in a position to give such an assurance in September 2002 and the developers of the Balbriggan location, together with the developers at two other locations, were invited to submit costing proposals for supply of the premises and fit-out of the offices. Based on these proposals, the Office of Public Works carried out negotiations on a contract and informed the Department of Foreign Affairs on 29 January 2003 that it had accepted the offer of the developers of the Fingal Bay business park in Balbriggan for the provision of a building and fit-out for the new passport premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The Minister for Foreign Affairs appreciates the Deputy's disappointment that a suitable location was not identified in his constituency. However, the decision making process in relation to the selection of the new passport office was fairly conducted, based throughout on objective criteria and the Minister is satisfied that the result was the correct one. The Minister has full confidence that the building to be supplied at Balbriggan will be a high quality flagship, both for the Government's decentralisation programme and for the process of modernising the public services. He is happy that the Office of Public Works has negotiated the most economically advantageous contract with the Fingal Bay business park developers. He looks forward to the delivery of the fitted-out premises by 1 September 2003, in accordance with the work programme for the passport project which will enable the project to be completed by the planned date of autumn 2004.</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1011">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, for coming into the House for this matter. However, I must express regret that neither of the Ministers directly responsible have bothered to turn up, namely the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, or the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. What is happening in the Finglas children's centre is a scandal. The two Ministers directly responsible stand indicted for their failure to take action on what has been going on there. In spite of the fact that they have been well aware of the situation in  Finglas and the ongoing serious difficulties which exist, they have failed to take obvious action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">Up to four years ago Finglas children's centre was regarded as a centre of excellence which was well managed with progressive policies, low staff turnover, high bed occupancy and an optimistic future. In the past four years it has deteriorated into ongoing crisis, with constant reports of riots, assaults, absconders, <i>ad hoc</i> planning, high staff turnover, low bed occupancy, threatened industrial action and escalating annual budgets. The staff, both individually and through their unions, have made numerous approaches to local management, the board of management, the Department of Education and Science's child care adviser and the many officials in the Department. They also made repeated representations to the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in an attempt to highlight the ongoing crisis and chaos in Finglas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The then Minister, Deputy Woods, ordered an inspection to take place in March 2002. The results of this inspection are detailed in Mr. Mike Laxton's report, which was published in July 2002. That report confirmed the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">It is evident and undeniable that the organisation is in acute crisis. It lacks clear direction, it is not meeting a number of basic requirements . . .  All of these factors mean that the young people are not receiving the level of care, control and education that they require and on occasions, it is not safe for young people and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">It stated that "Huge numbers of staff have left and significant numbers are sick" on a regular basis and that high absconding rates are another indicator of a unit not coping. It stated in the case of the robust unit that "this development gives the impression of evolving rather than being carefully planned" and "the opening of the robust unit was itself born out of crisis for which everyone involved has paid a price, including the young people."</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">This is a fairly damning report on a centre that has been operated under the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. It is also damning in view of the rising problem of juvenile crime. On a regular basis we are seeing young offenders coming before the courts with 40 or 50 charges against them. If such young offenders are given a custodial sentence in one of the detention centres, too often when the Garda take them out to the centres there are no beds available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">In that context, it is inexcusable that the State should preside over the chaotic situation in Finglas, where at present only about one third of the beds are occupied and the place is in complete disarray. The centre, intended to provide  care for young people who are dysfunctional, is truly dysfunctional itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Is the Minister aware that the Finglas children's centre was regarded as a centre of excellence up to four years ago? What has he done to ascertain why this acute crisis has arisen? There is no evidence that the Minister has taken action since July 2002, when Mr. Laxton's report was published. What action, if any, has the Minister taken to ensure that children and staff are now safe? It was found last year in Mr. Laxton's report that the Finglas centre is not a safe place for either young offenders or staff. What has the Minister done about it? There is no evidence that he has taken any action whatsoever in that regard. Has the Minister confidence in the management of the centre? If not, why is he not taking action on that front? Will the Minister clarify the status of Mr. Laxton in relation to the centre and whether he has an ongoing role in the centre?</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">Will the Minister clarify the confusion around this inspection? The then Minister, Deputy Woods, first stated in January 2002 that he was ordering an investigation. When he was queried on that further, he stated it was an inspection. Then he stated it was a run-of-the-mill inspection, but the investigation that was carried out showed a centre in crisis. There is no denying that fact. It is there in black and white in Mr. Laxton's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Eight months later, there is no evidence of the Minister responsible having taken action on it. Will the Minister clarify what exactly is the future of the Finglas centre? There is a huge demand for additional places. The places, because of the bed occupancy rate, cost about €250,000 per year. This is a scandal which the Committee of Public Accounts should examine. Most importantly, it is a scandal that the Minister is allowing the most vulnerable and most harmed children to be left in danger. It is reprehensible that the Minister treats staff like that also. Will the Minister take action?</p>

        <speech by="#SiledeValera" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_548">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
          <p eId="para_1021">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I welcome the opportunity to address the issue of the Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre as raised by Deputy Shortall. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Education and Science commissioned an independent inspector, Mr. Mike Laxton, an internationally recognised expert in the field of residential child care, to carry out an inspection of the Finglas centre. The focus of this inspection was an examination of the centre's systems and procedures and standards of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Mr. Laxton examined and inspected the operations of the centre by reference to draft standards that were drawn up by my Department in consultation with the centres themselves and the social services inspectorate. These standards cover all aspects of residential child care and reflect best practice both in Ireland and internationally. These standards have been reviewed  and were finalised late last year. The standards issued to all young offender centres earlier this year and are available on the Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The inspector completed his work in July 2002. He submitted the report to my Department and referred it to the chairperson of the board of management and to the director of the centre. The report of the inspection is available on my Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The overall conclusion of the inspector is that on balance and subject to a number of conditions, the centre should remain open and be given an opportunity to improve its overall performance. The report found that:</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The organisation is in acute crisis. It lacks clear direction, it is not meeting a number of basic requirements and there are internal undermining conflicts in the organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">The inspector found lack of a strategic plan and a clear sense of how it was to be implemented and managed. In terms of management of the centre, the inspector found that "The management issues are manifold and stem primarily from the need to change the centre's practices, policies and procedures to meet the requirements demanded of best practice."  The inspector found a lack of consensus about key aspects of care or "a common care culture" and concluded that the task of management is to establish such a culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The report identified an urgent need for the external management arrangement for the centre and all the young offender centres to be reviewed by the Department of Education and Science. In this regard, the inspector recognises that the manner in which all the residential centres under the aegis of the Department are externally managed is a major policy issue. The inspector refers to a separate review on the future role of the residential centres which will have an impact in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The review referred to is one which my Department has commissioned Mr. Laxton to undertake of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are sufficient and appropriate residential places available to meet the needs of the target group into the future. The review will also indicate if existing places are being used to best effect. As Deputy Shortall will be aware, the centres are currently governed by the terms of the Children Act 1908 which will be replaced by the Children Act 2001 when the provisions of the latter Act are commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">In September 2002 my Department received the views of the board of management. The appropriate staff unions were then consulted about the future of the centre. My Department has retained Mr. Laxton to monitor progress at the Finglas centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">As was acknowledged in the inspection report, a major programme of capital redevelopment works has been undertaken in the centre over the past three years. These works have reduced the  capacity of the centre and caused considerable disruption for both the young persons in care and the staff. Since 1999, some €2.7 million has been spent on capital redevelopment at Finglas. These works involved the conversion of the old dormitory-style accommodation to meet with modern standards. They also included the provision of a pre-release and step-down facility called the Grove at Finglas. The current phase of refurbishment works involving the upgrading of the education and administration areas and some of the living areas, at a cost of €12.2 million, is due to be completed by June 2003. The Minister would like to record his gratitude to all at the centre for their continued co-operation in this regard. He is aware of the ongoing difficulties and his Department is committed to addressing all the issues facing the centre.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1031">I ask the Minister of State whether the conditions at the Ballyfermot Health Centre are acceptable in this century, because they were not acceptable in the last century. I have with me a number of photographs, which I will pass to the Minister of State when I am finished. The facility is akin to an airport hangar from the Second World War. Anybody who views these photographs will see the dereliction and dilapidation of which I speak. The condition of the facility is visible even from the outside: there is paint peeling from the walls and there are grilles everywhere. This facility is supposed to help people with mental health problems, but the first thing induced by such a facility is depression. This does not help the staff who are doing a tremendous job in the facility. It does not motivate them when they arrive to work in the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The centre is too small for both the client base and the number of staff based there. The canteen facilities are very poor. Recently, one of the staff was seriously assaulted when he tried to prevent somebody from setting fire to the facility, although the staff have been calling for over two years for extra security precautions to prevent such an occurrence. At the very least, the centre should be kept clean, attractive and user-friendly and should reflect the care we give to those who are ill. It should be a centre of excellence. The state of this facility and the lack of resources it receives say a lot about the priority we give to the sick, especially those who have a mental illness and who may not be able to judge properly the world around them or speak up for themselves. Nobody is looking for a four-star facility; the staff and the users are only seeking the bare minimum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Amnesty International has called the state of mental health care in Ireland shameful and has pointed out that services are inadequate and under-resourced. We are seriously out of step with international best practice and have failed to comply with international human rights law. That is an indictment of the State. I ask the Minister at the very least to address the problems faced by  this centre, but he should also deal with the many other centres that deal with this affliction. One in four Irish people suffer from mental illness and require some type of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">I asked related questions earlier in written form and the answer I received was that responsibility lay with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Minister still has an overall responsibility to ensure that the health authorities make sure that such facilities are of the best standard in the world. We should set a standard of excellence that other countries look to mirror. We have ratified a UN convention recognising the right of everybody to enjoy the highest attainable standard of mental health and the best available mental health care. Looking at these pictures and talking to some of the users and staff of this facility, one can tell that this is not available in the Ballyfermot Health Centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">The Government has failed to act on a serious of reports, both international and national, critical of inaction on the human rights of people with mental illness. We have failed to meet the standards outlined by the World Health Organisation and in the UN principles for the protection of persons with mental illness. It is not good enough to say that there is a problem with funding in all sectors of the health service. The crisis in this facility has not just emerged in the last couple of weeks. It has been an ongoing problem and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible, before another staff member is attacked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">As I said, the facility resembles an airport hangar. There are grills on every window. It would be interesting, if the Health and Safety Authority were to visit the site, whether it would pass muster. I doubt it. I am asking that adequate resources be put into the health sector, particularly towards addressing the problems I have identified, and that the health authority urgently address these problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_1037">The Minister for Health and Children has asked me to take this debate on his behalf and he wishes to thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for raising this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Advancement in the standards of care for psychiatric patients, following the recommendations of the report, Planning for the Future, remains at the heart of developing and improving psychiatric services. Planning for the Future recommended the establishment of a comprehensive, community-oriented mental health service as an alternative to institutional care for persons with mental illness. The shift in the delivery of services from predominantly hospital-based care to care in the community has been extremely successful in Ireland and undoubtedly the quality of care for persons with a mental illness has been enhanced by this development. It has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients, with a corresponding increase in the range of care facilities based in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The building the Deputy refers to houses the sector headquarters, the day centre and the day  hospital for the Ballyfermot area. The Minister has been informed by the South-Western Area Health Board that, in spite of a programme of refurbishment, involving redecoration, alterations and on-going maintenance, the building remains sub-standard in its prefabricated state. However, the board will endeavour to acquire suitable premises to replace this facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The building comprises myriad small offices. Overcrowding is not necessarily an issue, but it is acknowledged that there is a lack of natural light and ventilation in the waiting areas. While it is not ideal that the day centre and the day hospital are housed in the same building, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals assures the Minister that the service provided by the multidisciplinary teams to service users at this location is one of the best within the service generally. In their role as advocates for service users, staff have consistently raised the issue of conditions at this centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Every effort has been made by the South-Western Area Health Board to make the building as secure as possible for staff and clients. The incident to which the Deputy refers took place on Friday, 7 March 2003. As this case is <i>sub judice</i> and the matter is currently being dealt with by the Garda in Ballyfermot, the Minister is not in a  position to comment further on the matter at this time. In 1998, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals published guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in mental health services and these guidelines were issued to all service providers. The guidelines recommend that all staff should be trained in the techniques of management of violence and aggression through participation in a recognised training course.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Approximately €190 million capital will be provided over the lifetime of the national development plan for mental health services. While a significant part of this funding will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals, it will also provide for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences, which will accelerate the phasing out of the old psychiatric institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Substantial progress has been made in recent years to ensure that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. However, it is accepted that much remains to be done and the Government is committed to the provision of quality care in the area of mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 March 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1047">In May 2001 the Competition Authority decided, on its own initiative, to undertake a study of competition in a number of professions under section 11 of the Competition Act 1991 as amended. Following a public consultation process, the authority decided that the professions to be studied in detail were medical practitioner, dentist, veterinary surgeon, optometrist, solicitor, barrister, architect and engineer.</p>

I understand that the Indecon report will provide the main research basis for the remainder of the authority's study which will now move into the next phase, profession by profession, starting with engineers. Using the Indecon findings the authority will soon publish a public consultation paper on competition in each of the eight professions. I understand the authority will finalise its first report before the end May and subsequent reports will be produced later in the year and into 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1050">The Companies Registration Office is not in a position to provide accurate data on the number of children who have been appointed as company directors without carrying out a detailed examination of CRO records. This issue was raised by representatives  of the CRO with the company law review group. The CRO informed the CLRG that it had identified a number of companies where the age of the directors fell below 18 years and that CRO had no legal basis to refuse to register such persons as directors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">The CLRG in its first report dated December 2001, noted that Ireland is not alone in not having a minimum age for directors. Most European countries, including the UK, do not have a minimum age. In view of the serious responsibilities and potential liabilities of company directors, the CLRG gave consideration as to whether there ought to be a minimum age for appointment as a director. The group recommended that no person be allowed to become a company director until the person has reached 18 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The reasoning for this is that being a director carries responsibilities and duties and it is necessary that those who are accountable and answerable are of an age that will understand those duties. Furthermore, persons under 18 have no contractual capacity and it would be anomalous if this could be circumvented by a minor setting up a company. The legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the CLRG is currently being drafted by my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1058">A total of 16 investigations into company law matters have been initiated by me since I first took up office. In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Section 8 inquiries into the affairs of National Irish Bank Ltd and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are continuing. I understand that the final report is likely to be submitted to the High Court towards the end of 2003. One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the DPP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. A further report was recently completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Three investigations under section 19 are ongoing. The report in respect of one of these investigations is at a very advanced stage of completion. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June 2002. These inquiries are the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this has been referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_19">The costs incurred since 1997 on company  investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to €9.76 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this €9.76 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 – National Irish Bank, €4.9 million, and Ansbacher, €3.5 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_20">The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. The issue of recovering costs in relation to the Ansbacher inquiry is now before the courts. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Bill 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1066">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000. There are currently in the region of 23,682 participants on the programme and this number will reduce to a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_21">FÁS prioritises CE projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality, and co-ordinates reductions in CE places so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of the programme. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced  from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_22">The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1073">I am aware of the survey referred to by the Deputy. It was carried out by the European Commission in November 2002 and published last month. The consumer survey provides detailed information on the extent to which pre-tax prices for cars vary between member states. The methodology employed was to ask 18 European and eight Japanese manufacturers to supply the Commission with the recommended retail prices, as of 1 November 2002, of 84 of their best-selling models. The reference price for the calculation of differentials for any model is that of the cheapest country within the euro zone.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_24">In so far as Ireland is concerned, I understand the survey shows that car prices before taxes varied from being the cheapest in relation to three models to being up to 34% higher in relation to one model. Of the 84 models in the survey, 71 are available in the Irish market and Ireland is in the cheapest 33% bracket in relation  to 29 models. In overall terms, pre-tax prices of cars are 9.53% higher in Ireland than corresponding prices in the countries where prices are lowest. No doubt factors such as transport costs and right-hand drive are contributing to this divergence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25">Overall, the report showed that the divergence between prices in Europe has narrowed since the previous survey of May 2002 and that there was a decline of 0.2% in car prices generally. I expect that when the new competition rules for the motor vehicle sector come into force in October of this year there will be an even narrower divergence and that consumers will benefit from the new competition rules in this sector which are designed to give the consumer more choice.</summary>

By strategically increasing our spending in these key areas, this will increase future national competitiveness and lead to the creation of higher standards of living. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government has made provision for €1.5 billion in investment in RTDI for industrial development activities. This research and development investment is targeted at increasing innovation and raising the competitiveness levels within Irish companies in order to add economic value to their activities; increasing output and employment levels and moving up the business value chain. Underpinning many of the programmes being delivered by Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, is the promotion of closer co-operation and linkages between industry and Irish third level education institutions.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_28">I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing for many people, including young drivers, enterprises and schools. On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The pro gramme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">The key measures include the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB report – this committee meets on a monthly basis; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe – this report was published last October. A number of the recommendations have already been implemented, some by the insurance industry and some by the relevant Government Departments. Progress on the other recommendations is continuing; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB – this report was published last October; and establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, on an interim basis – the chairperson and ordinary members of the interim PIAB board were appointed on 27 November 2002. Agreement on the initial drafting of legislation to put PIAB on a statutory basis has been reached and the general scheme of the Bill for the establishment of the PIAB on a statutory basis, is intended to be published around the summer of 2003, after Government has given approval for drafting.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a joint study into insurance. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, I have made it clear that I expect aquid pro quo from the insurance industry, in the form of reduced premiums, in response to the reform programme. The insurance industry's response will be carefully monitored. The acid test will be the impact felt in the consumer's pocket. In this regard, it is heartening to note the recent reported comments from a number of the major motor insurers here, that further increases in premiums may not be necessary at present and, in one case, that they have already reduced premiums since the beginning of this year. As implementation of the measures contained in the reform programme continues, I expect this trend to continue.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1083">My Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are proceeding with the drafting of the employment permits Bill as a priority item and it is hoped that it will be published shortly after Easter. In the interim, I published a short Bill, entitled the Employment Permits Bill 2003 on 24 March with a view to its consideration by the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency. The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative basis necessary to grant full access to the labour market to the nationals of the Accession States after accession takes place on 1 May 2004. It also provides a safeguard mechanism if the labour market should suffer a disturbance after EU enlargement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">However, I am also availing of this opportunity to address an anomaly in the existing legislative basis governing the employment of non-EEA nationals in the State. This will have the effect of creating a specific offence for both an employer and an employee where one engages the services of the other in the absence of an employment permit, where such a permit is required. It is widely known that there is effectively no charge that can be brought against an employer who employs a person not entitled to work in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">This new provision, which should reduce illegal employment and the associated opportunities for exploitation, was originally introduced as an amendment to the Immigration Bill 2002, which has been passed by Seanad Éireann. As it is the intention that the employment permits Bill will be enacted first, the provision can be removed from the immigration Bill at the appropriate stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 141 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The latest Central Statistics Office quarterly industrial employment release gives preliminary estimates of industrial employment for September 2002. These estimates point to a decrease of 18,100 in industrial employment from 271,400 in September 2001 to 253,300 in September 2002. Given the fluctuating and uncertain world economic climate, it is not possible to provide definitive forecasts of numbers employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">According to the latest NCB Survey of Irish manufacturing, the purchasing managers index fell to 48.3 in February – a reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing compared to the previous month. This compares to the 48.1 index reading recorded in January, indicating that the rate of decline in manufacturing output eased slightly in February. Nevertheless, conditions in manufacturing remained soft in February, especially in respect of exports. The underlying employment position, however, remains very strong, with overall employment having increased by around 22% in the four years to August 2002, and the unemployment level continuing at a very low level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The Government and the industrial development agencies remain committed to implementing policies which will assist firms in sustaining and improving their overall competitive position. Continued implementation of the provisions of the national development plan and of the outcome of the recent partnership negotiations will be very important in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_32">The economic progress made by many Irish firms over recent years has placed them in a solid position to shield themselves somewhat from unfolding events and risks. In particular, recent efforts to improve domestic productivity, tackle cost pressures, invest in firm-level skills and education, and encourage innovation and new product development through increased research and development have resulted in many Irish firms being able to place themselves at a higher level of the value chain compared to major competitors.  Manufacturing will, therefore, be in as strong a position as possible to reap the maximum benefit from any future global economic improvement.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1098">It is not possible for the industrial development agencies to determine the number of jobs which have been relocated to low wage economies in any particular period due solely to lower labour costs, as the reasons for relocations are varied and complex. Factors contributing to a decision to relocate all or part of an enterprise may include consolidation, merger or acquisition, or changes in product or market focus, in addition to relative wage rates and other costs and available incentives. However, in the context of maintaining Ireland as an attractive and competitive location for investment, my Department and its agencies are continuously monitoring the position of firms in the manufacturing and services sectors to identify both opportunities for, and threats to, employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Ireland gains more than it loses from its status as an open economy, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years with any job losses being counteracted by firms choosing this country as a location for certain higher value added business functions. We have been remarkably successful at attracting long-life investments, with a number of foreign-owned companies successfully operating here for more than two decades.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_33">To facilitate enterprise development, we will continue, through active implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to focus on strengthening our research and development capacity, enhancing our skills base, implementing infrastructural improvements, and shaping the regulatory environment for enterprise. These measures will complement the efforts of capable companies to move up the value chain from basic production subsidiaries to strategically valuable  nerve centres of their parent multinationals. Competitiveness in world markets is a key factor which is also being addressed in the recently negotiated partnership arrangements and through policies at European Union level.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_34">The proposed introduction of carbon tax is in response to our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Taxation is one of the measures included in the Government's national climate change strategy, which sets out a framework of mechanisms to help Ireland meet its international  commitment. The Department of the Environment and Local Government brought forward proposals for the introduction of a carbon tax to the Department of Finance, in advance of the budget last December and the tax strategy group considered this proposal. Papers relating to this issue are available to view on the Department of Finance website. Agreement was not reached on the proposal at that time, however, the Minister for Finance signalled the introduction of a general carbon tax from the end of 2004, in his budget speech. The tax framework has not yet been developed. The Minister made it clear that given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultation with interested parties on the design of the tax. This commitment to consultation is reiterated in the draft social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which states that, in keeping with Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the announcement in the budget regarding the development of a general carbon tax, there will be full consultation with the social partners having regard to the potential implications for jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35">I expect that the Minister for Finance will initiate consultations to develop a framework for the tax shortly. My Department will be fully involved in the development process, where important issues with implications for industry are likely to include, the level at which the tax will be set, the question of exemptions or reductions for companies engaged in other greenhouse gas reduction measures such as emissions trading and negotiated agreements and the question of recycling the tax. In developing the tax framework, a crucial consideration will be minimisation of any impact on competitiveness.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">In relation to competitiveness, Forfás, in conjunction with my Department, has commissioned studies to assess how best to achieve the reduction targets specified for the enterprise sector in a way that would minimise the effects on competitiveness. These studies focused on taxation, negotiated agreements, emissions trading and investment in international greenhouse gas reduction projects. Industry representatives participated in the steering group for these studies. This work has been contributing to the development of policy for emission reductions in the enterprise sector and will be useful source of information in developing a framework for carbon taxation.</summary>

The reasons for such relocation are many, varied and complex and, on balance, Ireland continues to benefit from movement due to the underlying strength of our economy despite the recent world downturn. Companies cannot be competitive in all types of industrial activity and the agencies continue to seek to secure worthwhile employment in areas where Ireland has a competitive advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">The Government's strategy in facing the challenge of job losses to lower cost economies is to focus efforts on an embedding programme for existing overseas owned companies in this country. Through development programmes which IDA Ireland operates, it is aimed to have capable companies moving systematically up the value chain – from being basically-mandated subsidiary operations to being strategically-independent operations within their corporate structures worldwide. In order to maximize the potential of the existing base of overseas companies and to minimize job losses, IDA Ireland is encouraging them to add strategic functions including research and development, technical support, software development, e-commerce, logistics and shared services.</p>

There are other positive developments in South Tipperary – the ALZA Corporation is currently building a 60,000 square foot facility in the IDA business park in Cashel.

        <summary eId="sum_41">South Tipperary has a good range of foreign direct investment companies in the growing pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Companies such as Guidant, Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme and Clonmel Healthcare in Clonmel and now ALZA Corporation in Cashel provide a solid base of employment. These are complemented by another significant employer – SRAM Ireland in Carrick-on Suir.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_42">IDA Ireland will continue to promote Tipperary to potential investors, and the agency will also develop its business park in Tipperary town as an additional attraction. Planning permission has recently been secured to carry out an upgrade of the park by improving the entrance road and landscaping the site. An advance technology building of 16,000 square feet will be built on the park this year. Additionally in the town, the former Namco building of 60,000 square feet is available and is being actively marketed by the agency. I assure the Deputy that the State agencies under the auspices of my Department will continue to strongly promote the regions in the attraction of inward investment and the development and expansion of indigenous industry, including small industry.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1111">The recent closure of Technicolor and pending closure of Artesyn in Youghal are a major disappointment and I fully recognise the impact on the local community. However, the issue of job creation is a statutory function of the enterprise agencies under the aegis of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have a direct function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">IDA Ireland has responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment to individual areas and towns and is working closely with Enterprise Ireland in helping Artesyn and Technicolor prepare a profile of their buildings, which is vital for the successful marketing of these properties to potential investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">While east Cork has suffered job losses in recent times, it has also been extremely successful in terms of attracting new overseas investments to the area. Over 600 new jobs are expected to come on stream in the years ahead at Schlumberger, Fournier, RF Integration, Dow Corning and Amersham Health. In particular, east Cork has proved to be a particularly attractive location for the healthcare, pharmaceutical and internationally traded services sectors and IDA is hopeful that this will result in further investments in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The agencies are actively involved with Youghal Chamber of Commerce, and ongoing discussions are taking place with the chamber on developing a profile of the area, which will become an intrinsic part of the marketing material for the region. Earlier on this month, Enterprise Ireland, with the South Cork Enterprise Board, addressed a meeting of approximately 100 staff of Artesyn on supports for small business start-ups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">A similar meeting was held with staff members of Technicolour on the same theme. County enterprise board staff were also available on site for one-to-one meetings for those employees who wished to avail of their services. A follow up meeting is scheduled for 27 March in Youghal between Enterprise Ireland, Youghal Chamber of Commerce and other support organisations to formulate a tailored response to the specific needs of industry in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">FÁS, the national training authority, has contacted both companies to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS will make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and, in that regard, the enterprise agencies will continue to strongly promote east Cork in the attraction of inward investment and the development and expansion of indigenous industry, including small industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1121">Procedures to resolve industrial disputes in situations where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place were considered by a high level group, established under Partnership 2000. The group comprised representatives from IBEC, ICTU, and various Government Departments and agencies and was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. This group recommended a voluntary set of procedures and an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to provide a new dispute settling power for the Labour Court. These recommendations were implemented through Statutory Instrument No. 145 of 2000 – the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000 – and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">During the recent negotiations between the Government and the social partners on the new partnership programme Sustaining Progress, the need to enhance the effectiveness of these procedures was agreed. A number of measures which will result in significant improvements to the existing procedures will be put in place. These measures include the introduction of an overall timeframe of 26 weeks for processing cases under the code and the Act with provision for a maximum of 34 weeks. Effect will be given to these measures through amendments to the code and to the Act. On ratification of the agreement my Department will consult with trade union and employer representatives to develop proposals for enhancing the existing procedures.</p>

The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish.

The Deputy should note that, as the High Court award in this case arose from a civil action by way of a plenary summons, the labour inspectorate of my Department has no role in pursuing this particular aspect of the matter. The labour inspectorate continues to pursue the employment rights aspect of this case. Inspectors have interviewed the employer concerned and have examined some records in accordance with the relevant employment legislation. The inspectorate is not yet in a position to make a decision as to the appropriate next steps in this matter as it is experiencing some difficulties in the investigative process.

        <summary eId="sum_46">No formal assessment of the impact of the war on Ireland has been completed, but my Department and the enterprise development agencies are assessing developments as they unfold with a view to taking any action that can help to mini mise adverse consequences. There is agreement among all observers that no general conclusion can be reached at this time as to the impact of the conflict. Much will depend on its duration, and on the effect of the outcome on factors such as energy prices and confidence in the security climate. I am informed by the IDA that, following discussions with overseas companies, it does not expect any immediate negative effect on its client portfolio in terms of investment projects or employment – of course, the uncertainty of recent times has already for some time been a dampening factor on investment decisions and consumer confidence. In relation to the longer term, IDA points out that the 1991 Gulf War did not result in a decrease in the number of companies or total employment in its portfolio.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">The situation is being monitored and any practical measures that are feasible are being taken. For example, IDA has issued a circular to project executives instructing them to remind companies of the existence of the air cargo security programme, ASCP, introduced by the Government in 2002. This programme grants known consignor status to the air cargo of companies with the required security systems, thus reducing delays in the processing of international air cargo – an important consideration for companies with global supply chains and distant customers requiring just-in-time delivery.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1140">The issue of attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, to individual areas and towns is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland. In relation to the agency's strategy for north Kerry, IDA Ireland is focusing on pro moting the area as a location for investment in international services type projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">Ireland's recent economic success has changed its profile as a location for investment and we are now competing for a different type of business to that which we were so successful in attracting over the past four decades. Basic operative skills are now available at lower cost throughout the developing world. Improving communications facilitate businesses to locate parts of their value chains in distant locations. That is not to say that Ireland does not have a future in manufacturing; it does, but it will be through more advanced, sophisticated and complex processes based on knowledge and skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">IDA Ireland believes that regions need magnets of attraction, some compelling business reason or unique selling proposition that will attract investors. The challenge of achieving high value FDI into regional locations is considerable; nevertheless, progress is being made. In the case of north Kerry, Tralee has been designated a hub under the Government's national spatial strategy. Each region needs a hub of attraction, a location with the investment in world class infrastructure and services to be a magnet for the whole region. Around that hub, for approximately 40-50 kms. in every direction, the region can grow through attracting a wide range of enterprises, both local and international, which emerge because of the integrated competitive strengths of that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">In this regard, IDA Ireland has designated Listowel as a priority town in the mid-west region and the agency is committed to securing a new project for the town. The agency is aiming to attract a project from a complete range of IDA Ireland target sectors in either manufacturing or internationally traded services. Since its inception, IDA Ireland has been actively marketing the BES building in Listowel through its property division and its network of overseas offices. There have been a number of visits by overseas companies to the building, as well as viewings by members of the agency's international services division, who have also met with the promoters of the building. While these efforts have not yet resulted in the securing of a suitable inward investment project, IDA Ireland is continuing to actively market the BES facility and Listowel to potential clients. However, it is the client who makes the final decision on where any project will locate.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_51">In addition, IDA Ireland actively participates on and supports the Listowel development group. This initiative brings together all the resources relevant to the promotion of Listowel and includes the key development agencies for the region, together with representatives of local industry. At present, we are facing slow growth in the world economy, with considerable political and economic uncertainties. This makes it all the more difficult to attract foreign direct investment. However, IDA strategies have proved very successful to date, even in the most difficult of times. I am confident that the efforts and strategy being pursued by the agency and the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional develop ment will bring positive results for the people of Listowel.</summary>

      <b>Mr. O'Shea</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
       the progress made to date in her Department's investigation of a company (details supplied) which has been inviting Irish meat companies to recruit butchers from Nepal on the basis that they are shy and do not cause trouble and will be pleased to earn the national minimum wage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1149">I refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question, No. 165 of 18 February 2003, from Deputy Howlin.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_52">The labour inspectorate of my Department has commenced an investigation into allegations made in respect of the particular company. However, the investigation may be lengthy and time consuming as it may ultimately involve extending investigations to a number of other companies. The terms and conditions of employment for the meat industry are not regulated by the employment regulation order or registered employment agreement system under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946-2001. Accordingly, from an employment rights perspective, wage regu lation will be in accordance with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">However, should any individuals recruited from Nepal or any other country be paid less than their native Irish work colleagues, purely because of their place of origin, this would be a matter appropriate to investigation under the Employment Equality Act 1998 and would be a matter for the Employment Equality Authority and-or the Office of Director of Equality Investigations.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1381">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to review models of participation in social partnership, particularly from the point of view of maximising the efficiency of the process and the potential contribution of the diverse and vibrant community and voluntary sectors. In this context, a number of organisations have applied for inclusion in the social partnership process, including the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">My Department has met with all the organisations concerned. It was stressed at those meetings that, given the nature of the partnership process, any changes would be an outcome of the ongoing negotiations and that it was an inherent part of the process that any proposals for change would be discussed with the relevant pillar, in this instance the community and voluntary pillar. This process is continuing. I envisage that it will be possible to finalise the future participation arrangements in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1475">The future of the Polymer Development Centre in Athlone is a matter for Enterprise Ireland, and is not one in which I have a direct function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">However, I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that in reviewing the future of the Polymer Development Centre the agency came to the view that the work undertaken by the centre, while a valuable industrial support operation, responsive to the technology needs of the sector, should, in the future, be developed as a spin-off commercial entity, operating outside Enterprise Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">Following this decision Enterprise Ireland received an expression of interest in April 2002 from two members of the staff of the centre who have indicated their interest in pursuing a spin-off commercial option.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478">In addition, at the beginning of 2003 a proposal emerged from the Athlone Institute of Technology that would involve the facilities of the centre being absorbed into the institute to carry out a broad research and educational remit, while continuing to provide some level of continuing commercial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">In evaluating these options, Enterprise Ireland's objective is to reach an outcome which will best utilise the resources of the centre in the interests of the development needs of the sector within the Irish economy. Enterprise Ireland expects to bring these discussions to a conclusion as soon as possible, but within a target date of the next two months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1493">The requirement on retailers and other traders to display the selling price and unit price for all pre-packed products offered for sale to consumers was first introduced in October 2001 by the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2001.

          <p eId="para_1494">My Department initiated consultations with IBEC, RGDATA and other trade representative associations during the summer of 2002 about possible amendments to the regulations. A draft of the new regulations was published on my Department's website in November 2002 and sent to trade and consumer representative groups for comment. Some comments were received and the trade representative groups were consulted in relation to further amendments to the published draft of the regulations and the timing of the entry into force of the new regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">When making the regulations in December 2002 I provided that they would come into operation on 1 March 2003 so as to allow a further period of time to traders to make the necessary preparations to be able to comply with the regulations. This was followed up by press releases in January and February and the posting of a frequently asked questions document on my Department website.</p>

          <p eId="para_1501">FÁS and Forfás have recently published, on behalf of the expert group on future skills needs, the results of the national survey of vacancies in the private non-agricultural sector 2001-02. This survey was conducted by the ESRI in early 2002. It found an estimated 800 vacancies for fitters/mechanics out of a total of 40,000 vacancies. This represents a vacancy rate of about 2.1% and is less than the overall vacancy rate found in the survey of 3%. This survey, therefore, does not bear out a contention that the occupation of fitters-mechanics is particularly subject to shortages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">Out of the total of 47,810 work permit posts registered with FÁS in 2002, just 681, 0.014%, related to the mechanical sector which includes motor car mechanics, motor cycle mechanics and HGV mechanics. This figure does not appear to support the suggestion of an acute shortage in the availability of mechanics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">The recruitment of apprentices is an employer driven process. I am advised that the number of new registrants into the FÁS apprenticeship programme in car mechanics has reduced over the past three years by approximately 20% – from 550 in 2000 to 498 in 2001 and 458 in 2002. However, this reduction is common across FÁS apprenticeship programmes and reflects the labour market environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1505">I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing for many people, including young drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board – MIAB – report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board – PIAB – on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507">I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_69">While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, I have made it clear that I expect aquid pro quo from the insurance industry, in the form of reduced premiums, in response to the reform programme. The insurance industry's response will be carefully monitored. The acid test will be the impact felt in the consumer's  pocket. In this regard, it is heartening to note the recent reported comments from a number of the major motor insurers here, that further increases in premiums may not be necessary at present and, in one case, that they have already reduced premiums since the beginning of this year. As implementation of the measures contained in the reform programme continues, I would expect this trend to continue.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1511">The job initiative programme, JI, is an active labour market programme for persons unemployed for five years or longer and over 35 years of age. The primary objective of JI is to assist long-term unemployed persons to prepare for work opportunities available in the open labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">Participants contracts finish and individuals are replaced on JI on an ongoing basis. New participants are taken on based on the identified needs of the project and the priority of the service provided, and subject to an overall limit on funding and availability of places. Funding of €46 million has been provided for the programme in 2003 which will provide for an average participation rate in the region of 2,490. There were 2,525 participants on JI in January, 2003 and the target year-end participation rate is 2,200.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_70">The national employment service is available to assist JI participants and other unemployed persons progress to employment in the open labour market or further education or training opportunities, as they finish their term on the programme. In addition, the new high supports process, which was recently launched on a pilot basis in ten locations countrywide, will provide appropriate supports to meet the needs of those people, who because of age, literacy or other barriers are unlikely to succeed in getting, and keeping a job in the open labour market. The high  supports process will build on the existing guidance and counselling services provided under the dual stranded national employment service to help people to become job ready.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes, including JI, is currently in progress under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market. This committee includes representatives of the community pillar, employers and trade unions, as well as certain Government Departments and FÁS. A key element of the review of ALMPs will be towards reorienting ALMPs more closely in the future to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1514">I am confident that my Department facilitates any person with a new idea for business, regardless of age. However, support for entrepreneurs is a matter for the State's development agencies and, as such, my Department would generally refer representations to the relevant agency. The main agencies involved with the development of indigenous enterprise are Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the city and county enterprise boards. Enterprise Ireland assists small and medium sized Irish companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. Included in the agency's remit is responsibility for supporting high potential start-up companies, HPSUs, which are often high technology companies established by young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515">Shannon Development programmes are open to all age groups, with the determining factor being the business potential, both of the promoter(s) and the business idea itself. Shannon Development has strong links with young graduates, either through its VentureStart programmes, its liaison with various academic institutions and its sponsorship of student awards. The city and county enterprise boards continue to work actively in helping new and existing micro-enterprises in the county. As well as capital and employment grants, there are special strategies in place for entrepreneurs and a comprehensive programme of development and support programmes designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</p>

Some 32 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for legal proceedings, 25 of these arising from the investigative work of the labour inspectorate.

          <p eId="para_1557">I propose to take Questions Nos. 181, 182 and 183 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">Successive Governments have traditionally availed of the period around St. Patrick's Day to capitalise on the goodwill and unparalleled opportunities generated by the celebrations to promote Ireland around the world, including in terms of highlighting Ireland as an attractive tourist destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">I travelled to Savannah, Georgia during the period 16 to 19 March 2003 to attend St. Patrick's Day functions while the Naval Service ship, LE <i>Róisín,</i> was in port there. I was accompanied on the visit by my wife, the Secretary General of my Department and my private secretary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">On St. Patrick's Day, following Mass at the Cathedral of John the Baptist and a breakfast hosted by Bishop Boland, I reviewed the annual St. Patrick's Day parade. Later that evening, I represented the Government as guest speaker at the 191st annual Hibernian Society dinner. During my address to the society, I availed of the opportunity to promote Ireland as a top class tourist destination to a receptive audience of over 850 guests. I acknowledged the role played by organisations such as the Hibernian Society in preserving and promoting Irish cultural pursuits and values.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561">On 18 March 2003, I visited the LE <i>Róisín,</i> which arrived in Savannah on 13 March 2003. As Savannah has long-standing Irish heritage and family connections, the ship's company hosted local religious, civic and military dignitaries as well as members of the local business community during her goodwill visit. The ship's company also participated in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah. On 19 March 2003, I had to cut short my visit to return to Ireland to be present in the Dáil on 20 March 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_74">Prior to my visit, I was provided with an extensive brief on tourism in Ireland by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, which had been prepared by his Department. This brief proved to  be a valuable resource during the course of my engagements. I will brief my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, in relation to my visit to Savannah in due course.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1565">No herds were depopulated for TB based on singleton reactors between 1997 and 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566">The number of herds depopulated for brucellosis, which had a single laboratory positive animal during the same period was as follows: 1997 – ten herds; 1998 – 13 herds; 1999 – 26 herds; 2000 -18 herds; 2001 – 38 herds; and 2002 – 60 herds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567">In the case of brucellosis a number of factors are taken into account when deciding whether depopulation should be undertaken in any particular herd. These include number of reactors, pregnancy status of reactors, reactor titres, that is, high or low readings on blood results, likelihood of abortions or infected calvings having taken place, level of brucellosis in the area and in contiguous herds, and other relevant results, for example, milk ELISA results and gland culture results.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568">In recent years it has been the policy to depopulate infected herds at the earliest possible stage, with a view to limiting the likelihood of spread to neighbouring herds and to reducing the possibility of exposure of the farmer or farm workers etc. to infection. This approach also means that some animals may be removed before they are confirmed as reactors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569">This rapid depopulation policy, allied to a number of other measures introduced since 1998, has led to a significant reduction in the levels of brucellosis in the national herd.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570">The number of new restrictions for brucellosis has fallen from a peak of 1081 in 1998 to 430 in 2002 while the number of brucellosis depopulations has fallen from 328 in 1998 to 217 in 2002. The number of brucellosis reactor animals has fallen from 6417 in 1998 to 1530 in 2002. The improvement is continuing to date this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1572">The extent of the overshoot on the 2002 special beef premium is not yet fully calculated though a significant overshoot will arise. The scale of the overshoot is the result of a surge of applications submitted to my Department in late December 2002. This followed the early publication of a confidential draft legal text of the Commission proposals for the mid-term review, which included 2002 as one of three reference years for the purposes of establishing entitlements to the single direct payment. I have brought the matter to the attention of the European Commission with a view to finding a means of minimising the impact on farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1585">The person named applied for premium on 15 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. Payment of his 80% advance installment issued on 16 October 2002. Under new arrangements introduced by the EU with effect from January 2002 all bovine premia scheme applications must now be processed at producer level rather than application level. This means that before balancing payment can be made all applications under the special beef premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme must be fully  processed and examined together to establish in the case of suckler cow premium and special beef premium if stocking density levels have been complied with. If there is non-compliance under any of the three schemes, any resulting penalty calculation must take into account the total number of eligible animals under each of the schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586">While the producer approach will cause a slight delay in balancing payments for the suckler cow scheme the overall effect will be that any penalties imposed will be more proportional than heretofore. This arises because the number of non-compliant animals is divided by all the eligible animals under the three schemes as distinct from the number of eligible animals for the individual scheme as was the case up to now. The new arrangements have also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of on-farm inspections under the bovine schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1587">An additional factor in the 2002 schemes is that the national quota for the special beef premium scheme has been exceeded with an increase in the number of animals submitted for the premium in late December 2002. It will not be possible to definitively determine the exact percentage overshoot until such a time as all December 2002 applications have been fully processed. Balancing payments are expected to commence in April 2003.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1589">The restriction on stocking levels is the outcome of an agreement negotiated with the EU Commission in 1998, which secured the payments under measure A of REPS, known as supplementary measure A in the old scheme. The agreement was negotiated at a time when, because of significant environmental problems caused by overgrazing of sheep, the European Commission withdrew approval for payment on any commonage land declared in new REPS applications and intimated that it was contemplating compulsory measures  to control overgrazing with no compensation for farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590">My Department instead secured the Commission's agreement to introduce supplementary measure A of REPS, under which it has been possible to make very generous payments of up to €242 a hectare to farmers with commonage land. It was a condition of this agreement that my Department, together with Dúchas, was required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. The framework plans are objective scientific assessments of the environmental state of the commonages and the impact on them of grazing by sheep, and in many cases they recommend a certain level of destocking to allow damaged vegetation to regenerate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">At individual farm level, the destocking calculation is based on the 2001 quota, including any quota that may have been frozen previously under the interim 30% destocking applied in 1998 on six western counties including Mayo. The rules that I have announced for implementing the commonage framework plans are as flexible as they can be within the limits of the agreement with the Commission and no further changes can be made without Commission approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592">In February 2002, in an effort to place as much information as possible in the public domain, the percentage destocking required on completed commonage framework plans was posted on my Department's website on a townland by townland basis. In respect of the area referred to, a clerical error unfortunately resulted in the publication on the website of an incorrect destocking figure of 16.19% instead of the correct figure of 70.68%. When this error came to light it was immediately rectified on the website and letters subsequently issued informing shareholders of the correct preliminary calculation of their individual destocking requirements. In keeping with the rules for implementing the framework plans which I have announced, in 2003 no farmer in the area concerned will be subject to destocking of more than 50% and no farmer will have his or her quota reduced below 25.</p>

Supplementary measure five of the previous rural environmental protection scheme provided for payments to farmers who undertook to give public access to their land for environmentally friendly leisure and sporting activities. There is no supplementary measure of this kind in the new scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000. Unlike the regulation governing the previous scheme, the EU Council regulation under which the new REP scheme is implemented includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme.</p>

However, the Commission indicated that a public access measure was not admissible under the regulation, even as a State aid. Participants in the previous REPS who undertook supplementary measure five may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1671">Under new arrangements, introduced by the EU with effect from 1 January 2002, all bovine premia scheme applications must be processed at producer level rather than application level. This means that before balancing payment can be made all applications under the special beef premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme must be examined together to establish, in the case of the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium, if stocking density levels have been complied with. If there is non-compliance under any of the three schemes, any resulting penalty calculation must take into account the total number of eligible animals under each of the schemes. These new arrangements will be reflected in the next customer service action plan.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_77">While the producer approach will cause a slight  delay in balancing payments, the overall effect will be that any penalties imposed will be more proportional than heretofore. This arises because the number of non-compliant animals is divided by all the eligible animals under the three schemes, as distinct from the number of eligible animals for the individual scheme as was the case until now. The new arrangements have also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of on-farm inspections under the bovine schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">An additional factor in the 2002 schemes is that the national quota for the special beef premium scheme has been exceeded with an increase in the number of animals submitted for the premium in late December 2002. It will not be possible to definitively determine the exact percentage overshoot until such time as all December 2002 applications have been fully processed. Balancing payments are expected to commence in April 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1690">The SSIA scheme was introduced by section 33 of the 2001 Finance Act. It is a statutory condition of section 33 that the investor must make a subscription in each of the first 12 months, subject to the minimum and maximum rules. The legislation is specific that where this condition is breached the qualifying savings manager must terminate the account. The onus is on the account holder to ensure that his or her monthly payment is made on time to the qualifying savings manager. In the cases referred to by the Deputy, no subscription was made for the month of February 2003. In these circumstances, the qualifying savings manager had no option but to terminate the accounts in question.

The taxpayer's standard rate cut-off point has now been increased to €37,000 for the current tax year, which means that his income up to €37,000 is taxable at 20%.

It is estimated that transitional measures for all contracts signed prior to budget 2003 would have cost approximately €40 million, the bulk of which would be in respect of housing contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712">With regard to first-time buyers, in budget 2003 I announced an increase in the tax relief on mortgage interest available to first-time buyers. The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest against which tax relief at the standard rate may be claimed is being raised by over one-quarter from €3,175 single and €6,350 married/widowed to €4,000 and €8,000 respectively. In addition, the period in which this level of relief is available is being extended from five to seven years.</p>

          <p eId="para_1714">It is not my intention to make a subvention to Fingal County Council or, indeed, to any other local authority arising from the recent industrial action in the Valuation Office. While a regrettable effect of industrial action was that the Valuation Office was unable to deliver a full valuation service to local authorities, I understand such action ceased earlier this year and that staff in the Valuation Office have resumed normal duties. I am confident that management at the Valuation Office is  working to ensure that any backlog that might have arisen is being addressed in order to ensure local authorities can maximise their revenue for this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">I understand that all revision requests received by the Valuation Office from Fingal County Council during 2002 were dealt with although 15 properties were not valued. These properties are currently the subject of an appeal by the council to the Commissioner of Valuation. The council's income from commercial rates for 2003 will increase if any of these appeals is successful.</p>

          <p eId="para_1717">Unlike the roads and other open areas within the Sidmonton Court estate, the green area in question – between Meath Road and Sidmonton Court – was not taken in charge by the local authority after completion. The green area became vested in me, as Minister for Finance, under section 28 of the State Property Act 1954 upon the dissolution of Durkan Brothers Limited, later known as DB (Dublin) Limited, the company which developed Sidmonton Court estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">It is the policy of my Department to give consideration to all applications for waivers of the State's interest in property vested in the State under the State Property Act 1954. In this case, an application was received for a waiver in respect of a small portion of the green area in question in order for the applicant to gain access to a site purchased by the applicant for the purposes of building a house.  From a legal point of view, the Chief State Solicitor recommended that a right of way over the green area be granted in this case under section 31 of the State Property Act 1954. This was accepted by my Department and approved by the Government contracts committee.</p>

Individuals who are aged between 66 and 70 also qualify for the telephone allowance scheme if they are in receipt of a qualifying payment and live alone or with certain excepted persons. Qualifying payments include old age contributory or non-contributory pension, retirement pension, blind pension and widow's/widower's contributory or non-contributory pension.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1797">Until 1973, the law required female established civil servants to resign on marriage. Civil servants affected by this requirement did not qualify for superannuation benefits. They did, however, qualify for a marriage gratuity of one month's pay per year of service, subject to a maximum of one year's salary, provided that they had five years' service. A similar situation prevailed elsewhere in the public service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_86">The position of women who resigned because of the marriage bar was not addressed by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, except in so far as the commission dealt with the interest rate applied on marriage gratuity repayment where such women were re-employed in the public service. In its final report, published in January 2001, the commission recommended that compound interest should continue to apply to repayment of the gratuity, but that the current rate of 6% should be reduced to 4%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">In September 2001 the Government accepted the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission, and set up a working group to advise on implementation of those reforms. The operational details of the commission recommendations were to be agreed by Government on receipt of a report from the working group, which comprised representatives of the public service unions and relevant Government Departments. The working group has considered the commission's recommendation concerning the interest rate on marriage gratuity repayment. The report of the working group is currently being drawn up, it is expected that it will be put before Government by the middle of this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">The Government will carefully consider the advice it receives from the working group on the interest rate applied to marriage gratuity repayment. Beyond this, there are no plans to alter thestatus quo with regard to former public servants who retired on marriage.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1804">This question relates to a recent newspaper report which claimed that 3% of GNP is now being invested from this State into British property. The financial flows data available is not compiled in a fashion to enable this claim to be investigated. As a member of the EU, Ireland abolished its last remaining general exchange controls after 31 December 1992. Remaining controls apply only to a limited number of countries and only in situations where UN and EU sanctions exist. It should be noted that as a small open economy with significant foreign investment, there are large capital flows in and out of the country on a continuous basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1805">The post-budget estimate of the yield for 2003 from stamp duty on non-residential property is in the order of €450 million and present indications are that the yield for January 2003 is in line with the targeted projection for that month. Final figures for February 2003 are not yet available. As is the case with all taxes and duties, there is continual monitoring of the monthly target projections with the actual monthly yields throughout the year, and it is not possible at this stage to forecast what the actual out-turn for 2003 will be as compared to the post-budget estimate. I have no plans to alter the new stamp duty rates for non-residential property as set out in the 2003 budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_1807">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that stamp duty property yield figures are maintained on a calendar year basis to mirror the budget targets set annually and that the monthly breakdown yield figures for the non-residential element of the overall property yield figure for the years 2000 and 2001 were not maintained by the commissioners and are therefore not available for the type of comparison sought in the Deputy's ques tion. In addition, it must be said that because transitional arrangements were put in place up to 1 March 2003, the full effect of the revised rates and threshold bands would not, at this stage, have materialised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1808">The Revenue Commissioners have, however, advised that the stamp duty yield from non-residential property in 2002 was €316.9 million and that the projected yield for 2003, taking into account the revised rates and thresholds bands announced in the budget in December last, is in the order of €450 million.

          <p eId="para_1819">There is no specific tax relief available to parents in relation to the costs incurred for child care and there are no plans at present to introduce such relief. There are, however, a number of provisions within the income tax code to assist widowed persons including those with dependent children. In the year of bereavement a widowed person may receive a personal tax credit of €3,040, which is equivalent in value to the married person's tax credit. Following the year of bereavement, a widowed parent with a qualifying child or children may qualify for the one-parent family tax credit of €1,520 in addition to the personal tax credit of €1,520. A further tax credit, the widowed parent tax credit, is available on a sliding scale for the first five tax years following the year of bereavement as follows: Year 1–€2,600; Year 2–€2,100; Year 3–€1,600; Year 4–€1,100; Year 5–€ 600.</p>
          <p eId="para_1820">Therefore, in the first year following bereavement, a widowed parent is entitled to aggregate tax credits of €5,640, comprising a single personal credit of €1,520, a one-parent family credit of €1,520 and a widowed parent credit of €2,600.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_90">For widowed persons with no dependent children, a tax credit of €300, which is additional to the basic personal tax credit, is available after the  year of bereavement.

The Government responds in two ways to the needs of these children. In the short-term we focus on saving lives in the most effective way possible, through direct assistance via the UN system and international agencies, as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In the long-term the Ireland Aid development programmes tackle the structural reasons underlying endemic poverty and food insecurity.</p>

The Government has provided €9 million for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to date this year.

In 2002 the Government intervened to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water and medicine on more than 120 occasions in over 30 countries throughout the world.</p>

On foot of his visits, he communicated directly with his EU counterparts to urge a greater humanitarian response. He has also met with key figures in the EU and UN, including the EU Commissioner with responsibility for development, the deputy executive director of the UN World Food Programme and the Secretary General of the International Federation of the  Red Cross to highlight his concerns and to discuss ways of improving the co-ordination of assistance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">The Government addresses the needs of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), particularly in Africa and the Middle East. Ireland supports a range of Irish NGOs and international agencies providing humanitarian assistance for those displaced from their homes as a result of natural or man-made disasters. This year Ireland Aid has provided over €7 million to the UN High Commission for Refugees. Substantial funding has also been delivered to the International Organisation for Migration, Refugee Trust International and the International Committee of the Red Cross for their ongoing assistance for refugees and IDPs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">If we are to lessen the level of population displacement and food insecurity in the future, the underlying structural problems affecting stability and poverty must be addressed. Ireland Aid has strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through these partnerships Ireland Aid fully engages with governments and donors on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans (PRSPs). The PRSPs outline how each country prioritises resources and policies with the objective of reducing poverty. This comprehensive and African-owned approach by donors, governments and civil societies stands the best chance of breaking the cyclical nature of food insecurity and facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of Africans.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1834">I refer to my reply to Question No. 172 of 5 March 2003. The Government is concerned at the persistence of allegations of police torture and ill-treatment in Serbia and Montenegro. The authorities in Belgrade are aware of our concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1835">The state union of Serbia and Montenegro was proclaimed on 4 February 2003, in succession to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Agreement on the formation of the state union was brokered by the European Union, which has strongly supported the establishment of the new federal institutions and the implementation of wide-ranging political and economic reforms. The improvement of the human rights situation in Serbia and Montenegro is an essential element of the reform process required for the further development of the country's relations with the EU.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_94">There has been progress, especially in recent months. Article 9 of the constitutional charter of the new federal state commits the authorities in  Serbia and Montenegro to ensuring the protection of human rights and minority rights. One of the first acts of the new federal parliament was the adoption of a charter on human rights and minorities. These developments, and the engagement of the EU and the wider international community in support of the reform process, will lead to an early improvement in policing standards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">Following the assassination of the Prime Minister of Serbia, Zoran Djindjic, on 12 March, a state of emergency has been declared in Serbia. The perpetrators of this dreadful act were the enemies of democracy and of human rights. I strongly welcome the determination of the new Serbian Government, under Prime Minister, Zoran Zivkovic, and of the federal authorities to continue to pursue the reform process and the development of closer relations with the European Union. They will have the full support of the EU. I look forward to the early stabilisation of the situation in Serbia and to the lifting of the state of emergency.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">The continued implementation of policing and judicial reforms will be essential to the ending of all torture and ill-treatment by police. The international community is assisting in a number of ways, including an OSCE programme of police training in Montenegro, southern Serbia and Belgrade. Ireland is also playing its part bilaterally as the major donor for a three-year Council of Europe programme of human rights training for all judges and prosecutors in Serbia and Montenegro, and for a number of lawyers and NGO experts. Ireland Aid has committed €500,000 to the programme, which focuses on the development of expertise in international human rights law, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the application of its principles in Serbia and Montenegro.</summary>

From NGO reports it is understood that she was taken from her home late at night in March 2001 by members of the Public Security Bureau. She is believed to have been detained in Sitru, the provincial level police detention centre in Lhasa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1838">The exact reasons for her arrest are unclear, but unconfirmed reports suggest that she was accused of possessing "separatist" material from the Tibetan exile community in India, which had been copied and distributed in Lhasa. She was subsequently assigned to serve three years at the Trisam re-education through labour centre in either October or November 2001.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_97">According to Amnesty International, re-edu cation through labour is a form of administrative detention by which people are detained without charge or trial for periods of between one and four years. It is used to detain people who are suspected of committing offences which are not deemed serious enough to be punished under the criminal law. Over the years many political dissidents and people labelled as "anti-social elements" have been detained in this way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">The Government, in bilateral contacts with China, and through contacts between the European Union and China, has consistently called on the Chinese Government to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">The EU discusses key human rights concerns, including those relating to Tibet, with China in the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which provides a forum for an in-depth discussion of these issues. The last session of the dialogue took place on 5 and 6 March 2003 in Athens. Among the issues discussed were the general human rights situation in Tibet and the continued use of re-education through labour, as well as other issues such as co-operation with UN human rights mechanisms, the continuation of "strike hard" campaigns, the need for judicial reforms, the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, torture and the extensive use of the death penalty. The EU continues to evaluate the results of the dialogue at regular intervals to determine how far its expectations have been met.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">Ireland and the EU will avail of every opportunity to raise their concerns regarding the situation of Tibet through the EU-China human rights dialogue, as well as through appropriate action at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">Last week, I attended the External Relations Council meeting in Brussels, at which the Council issued conclusions on the human rights situation in China, including Tibet. These conclusions restated the EU's concern about the continuing practice of re-education through labour, and called on China to end the practice. They also expressed the EU's deep concern over the deprivation of religious and cultural rights in Tibet, and underlined the need for the human rights dialogue with China to be based on genuine demonstrations of mutual confidence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_102">At the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which is currently ongoing in Geneva, Ireland, along with our EU partners, will make known our concerns in regard to human rights violations in China and, in particular, our concerns in relation to the deprivation of religious and cultural rights in Tibet.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1840">Human rights issues are an important element of contacts at all levels between the European Union and the Government of Turkey. EU embassies in Ankara, including the Irish embassy, and the representation of the Commission, monitor the human rights situation in Turkey and regularly raise with the Turkish authorities formally and informally allegations of torture and ill-treatment in custody. The general issue of sexual violence against women and men in detention and specific allegations have been raised with the Turkish Government as part of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1841">Turkey adopted a series of human rights reforms during 2002 which included legislation aimed at the abolition of torture and ill-treatment of people in custody. I have welcomed these reforms and I welcome the willingness on the part of the Turkish Government to address the issue of torture in all its forms. It is important now that the legislative reforms be fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1842">The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 reaffirmed that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the same political criteria which apply to other candidate countries. These include the political criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 which stipulate that a candidate country must achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1843">As is the practice for all candidate countries, the Commission prepares an annual report on Turkey's progress towards meeting the Copenhagen political criteria. The Commission report for 2002 stated that the adoption of the human rights reforms, "demonstrates the determination of the majority of Turkey's political leaders to move towards further alignment with the values and standards of the European Union."  It noted that these reforms were adopted under difficult political and economic circumstances, and represented a major shift in the Turkish context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1844">The Copenhagen European Council last December strongly welcomed the legislative packages and implementation measures adopted by Turkey and encouraged the energetic pursuit of the reform process. It gave the commitment that if the European Council in December 2004 decides that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations without delay. This decision will be based on a report and a recommendation from the Commission. The eradication of all forms of torture and ill-treatment in custody will be an important element of the assessment of the human rights situation in Turkey in this context.</p>

          <p eId="para_1849">Ireland has continued to work with our partners in the European Union to ensure that our concerns about the human rights situation of Kurds are raised with the relevant Governments in the region. The military conflict in Iraq has heightened the tensions among Kurdish populations in Iraq and neighbouring states. The Government is concerned about the potential impact of the conflict on Kurdish populations and will continue to urge all parties to exercise the greatest care to ensure that the rights and physical security of these populations are fully respected. The European Council in Brussels on 20 March 2003 reaffirmed the commitment of the EU to the territorial integrity, sovereignty, political stability and full and effective disarmament of Iraq in all its territory, as well as respect for the rights of the Iraqi people, including all persons belonging to minorities. It confirmed that the EU will actively engage in supporting regional stability and called on all countries of the region to refrain from actions that could lead to further instability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1850">As regards Turkey, which is a candidate country for membership of the European Union, we have regularly expressed our concerns on issues relating specifically to the situation of Kurds and the general human rights situation. I have welcomed the human rights reforms adopted in Turkey in 2002, which included the abolition of the death penalty, lifting of states of emergency and authorising of broadcasting and education in languages other than Turkish. These measures, if fully implemented, will enhance the cultural and ethnic rights of all citizens, including those of Kurdish origin. I hope the new Turkish Government will take all the steps necessary to adopt the remaining implementing regulations as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1852">As the world enters the third decade of the AIDS epidemic, the evidence of its impact is undeniable. By far the worst affected region, sub-Saharan Africa, is now home to 29.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS. Approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred there in 2002, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans in the past year. The Cuban Government's offer to help fight the epidemic through the provision of medical personnel in places with a high incidence of AIDS, like Africa, is commendable. The spread of HIV/AIDS in Cuba has been curtailed, largely due to the proactive approach adopted by the Government of that country and the implementation of effective prevention and education programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1853">The Irish Government's response to HIV/AIDS is guided by the HIV/AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid programme published in 2000. A growing aid budget and a strong commitment to delivering on this strategy have meant very substantial increases in the volume of financial resources allocated by Ireland Aid to programmes in response to the HIV-AIDS epidemic. This funding is directed at HIV/AIDS activities, primarily in Africa and implemented through international organisations, NGOs, regional initiatives and in programme countries. The focus of Ireland Aid's support is on developing the capacity of partner governments and national AIDS councils to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and to mitigate the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. In 2003, over €40 million has been allocated by Ireland Aid across a number of activities including the global fund for AIDS, TB and malaria; AIDS vaccine research initiatives and prevention, care and support activities implemented by NGOs and UN agencies engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>

          <p eId="para_1858">I propose to take Questions Nos. 248, 249, 252 and 253 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1859">The National and Provincial Assembly elections which took place in Cuba on 19 January last did not correspond to Irish or European definitions of free and fair elections in a pluralist democracy. Under Cuba's one-party system, 609 candidates were nominated for 609 National Assembly seats, and 1,119 candidates were put forward for 1,119 seats in the provincial assemblies. The distinguished Cuban advocate of democracy and recipient of the 2003 European Parliament Sakharov award for freedom of expression, Mr. Oswaldo Paya, described the elections as, "an imposition, not an election."  I agree with Mr. Paya.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_104">Ireland and its EU partners have repeatedly urged the Cuban authorities to respond positively to Mr. Paya's constructive initiative for the development of pluralist democracy in Cuba, known as the Varela project. It is disappointing that the Havana Government has instead chosen to react negatively to the proposal. This disappointment is shared by former United States President, Jimmy Carter, who commended the project to President Castro during his visit to Cuba in May 2002. Last week, Mr. Carter again  appealed to the Cuban National Assembly not to dismiss the project out of hand, but to at least agree to place it on its agenda for consideration and debate. I endorse former President Carter's appeal. Mr. Paya has also been working hard to bridge the gap between those living on the island of Cuba and those in exile. There are encouraging indications that his recent visit to south Florida has had considerable success in this respect, particularly among the younger generation of Cuban-Americans.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">The whole thrust of Irish and EU policy towards Cuba is to encourage an easing of tensions, both within the island itself and between the Cuban Government and the large exile community in south Florida, so that the long-standing state of mutual hostility which gave rise to the sort of incidents for which the five Cuban citizens in question were convicted in the United States would become a thing of the past. It will be recalled that the five Cubans were found guilty on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder, following an investigation into the deaths of two young Cuban-Americans when the planes they were piloting were shot down on their way to drop leaflets over Havana in support of a human rights demonstration in the city. As it is essential that the appeal of the convictions, due to be heard next month, should be conducted in a fair and impartial manner free of political considerations, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the trial. I can, however, say that I understand the US authorities have emphatically rejected as quite unfounded the allegation that the prisoners have been denied access to their lawyers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">As I have mentioned, this kind of incident grew out of the extreme tensions which have existed between the Castro Government and the exile community since the overthrow of the Batista regime more than four decades ago. This long-standing state of mutual hostility has in effect been a kind of cold civil war characterised by constant verbal violence, sometimes erupting into actual physical violence but mainly conducted by means of an unrelenting exchange of polemic between Havana and Miami. Ireland, together with its EU partners, is endeavouring to encourage both sides to transcend the divisions of the past. That is also the reason Ireland and the European Union, while acknowledging and admiring the immense idealism which inspired the Cuban revolution and also respecting its undoubted social achievements, nevertheless strongly believe that it is high time to match those egalitarian accomplishments with similar advances in the sphere of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">It was in that spirit that when, for the first time, a number of Latin American countries sponsored a radically different kind of resolution on human rights in Cuba at last year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Government saw this as a constructive and non-confrontational opportunity and decided that Ireland  would co-sponsor the resolution. Instead of the adversarial indictments of previous years, the resolution took account of Cuba's remarkable achievements in terms of social rights such as health and education – maintained as far as possible in spite of the unilateral economic embargo against it – and invited the Cuban authorities to emulate their own achievements in the field of social rights by efforts towards matching advances in the sphere of civil and political rights by, for example, adhering to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">It is with considerable disappointment and concern, therefore, that just one year later and within weeks of the opening of the first fully-fledged delegation office of the EU Commission in Havana, I have learnt of the mass arrests in Cuba, over recent days, of more than 50 critics of the Havana Government, some of them close associates of Mr. Oswaldo Paya, apparently because they had simply exercised freedom of expression. The EU Presidency is approaching the Cuban authorities to express the Union's deep concern, and to seek an explanation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1867">Successive Irish Governments have traditionally availed of the period around St. Patrick's Day to capitalise on the goodwill and unparalleled opportunities generated by the celebrations to promote Ireland around the world, including in terms of highlighting Ireland as an attractive tourist destination. I carried out a full programme of events and meetings while I was in the San Francisco area. During the course of my engagements, tourism matters were discussed and promoted on many occasions, including in my meetings with the mayors of both San Francisco and Oakland. I also met with representatives of Tourism Ireland and the other state agencies during my engagements in Silicon Valley. I used my speaking engagements as additional opportunities to promote tourism to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1868">Officials of my Department met with their counterparts in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in advance of my visit, and I would like to express my appreciation to those officials who prepared comprehensive briefing material on tourism issues, which was very valuable. No doubt the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism will, in the light of the various ministerial visits and other promotional activities world-wide, co-ordinate, refine and appraise their strategy to maximise the benefits and spin-offs to the tourism industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1870">Successive Irish Governments have used the period around St. Patrick's Day to build the profile and foster the image of Ireland overseas. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, who visited New Zealand between 14 and 19 March, used the opportunity which his meetings and speaking engagements afforded to promote tourism to Ireland. During his visit, as well as attending St. Patrick's Day functions, the Minister of State met with Prime Minister, Helen Clarke, and key political and economic leaders, as well as members of the Irish community.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_109">The Minister of State attended a number of high profile St. Patrick's Day events in both Wellington and Auckland, one of which was a very successful reception hosted by Tourism Ireland at  the Consulate-General in Auckland. New Zealand is a growing market for Irish tourism and the event attracted almost all the key tour providers in the Auckland area, as well as a number of influential travel writers. Tourism Ireland was represented at a senior level by Mr. Jim Paul, director for emerging markets.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1872">I have already expressed my continuing concern at the crisis in the international coffee trade and the problems which this is causing for producers, most recently in answer to Questions Nos. 139 and 230 on 5 March 2003. The international coffee crisis was discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in November last. On that occasion, the Commission undertook to come forward with ideas to address the situation of commodities in general, including coffee. The overall consensus among Ministers is that there is no short-term solution to the problem. It was agreed that initiatives needed to be taken and the issue had to be looked at in the broader context, including with a view to sustainable development. I expect the Council to return to this matter soon on the basis of the Commission's ideas for dealing with the commodities situation. I am sure the Commission's work will address the practical proposals mentioned in the Deputy's question, which are also being advocated by OXFAM as part of its efforts to help alleviate the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1873">I welcome the coffee quality improvement programme which was put in place on 1 October 2002 by the International Coffee Organisation, of which Ireland and other EU member states are members. The launching of the new FAIRTRADE mark Ireland on 3 March 2003 will allow consumers who choose FAIRTRADE marked products, including coffee, to play an important role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner which promotes dignity and self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1876">On 17 December 2002 and again on 5 March of this year, I set out the Government's position with respect to the situation in West Papua. I reported that officials of my Department have remained in contact with the representatives of the West Papua action group. I understand from correspondence received from the Deputy that Mr. Sem Karoba from the Koteka Tribal Assembly in West Papua is in Ireland. My officials are available to meet with him and further review these issues. In my previous replies, I stated that the question of a possible UN review of the Act of Free Choice would be a matter in the first instance for the UN Secretariat and for the UN Secretary General. I also emphasised that the situation in West Papua and, in particular, the human rights situation there were matters of ongoing concern to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1877">At my request, further enquiries have again been made recently through our permanent representation to the UN. Following contacts with the UN secretariat, the mission has responded that the position remains the same – the matter is one in the first instance for the UN secretariat and, for it to be taken forward, the support of UN member states would be required. In this regard, our enquiries have confirmed that, at present, there is no significant support for this approach. There is, moreover, widespread concern that any such review might prejudice on-going efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Government in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1878">In January of this year, I took the opportunity of my attendance at the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting to meet with my Indonesian counterpart, Mr. Wirajuda. I referred to Ireland's interest in the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia. I raised issues of particular concern, such as respect for human rights and the tensions in West Papua and I made the point that these matters impact on our national perception of Indonesia. In reply, Minister Wirajuda referred to the difficult transition process which Indonesia has been undergoing, in terms of political, security and economic matters. With regard to West Papua, Minister Wirajuda commented on what he saw as an improving situation, and the implementation of the special autonomy law for West Papua.</p>
          <p eId="para_1879">EU member states are due to discuss the situation in Indonesia again at a future date. Among the issues we will examine will be the situation of West Papua. Deputies can be assured that the Government will continue to monitor very closely the situation in West Papua and will continue to encourage the Indonesian authorities to act with due regard to the rights and interests of the people of West Papua.</p>

          <p eId="para_1908">As the Deputy will be aware, in May 2002 my predecessor, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 additional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists as identified by the report Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, which was undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001. The announcement followed on the work of an interagency working group, comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, which was established to ensure the provision of these extra places and which considered proposals received from a number of third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and/or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1931">The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses, namely, the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLCs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1932">Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_114">Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the  position may be sent to my Department. The student referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to the student support unit of my Department. The decision of the local authority to refuse the additional grant was upheld, as the reckonable income exceeded the income threshold specified in the scheme. It is not open to me or to my Department to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1934">The position regarding the grant was set out in the 2003 school building programme, published in January. The programme shows that €18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant: €12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of €3,809 to each school and €5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita</i> element at €12.70 per pupil. The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme involving inspections of 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1935">The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</p>

The objective of the fund is to assist those students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.

Foundation courses do not meet the criteria in this regard. The eligibility criteria issued in respect of the 2002-03 academic year confirmed this position.

No appeal has been received in the student support unit of my Department from the student, referred to by the Deputy. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.

          <p eId="para_2230">The secondary teachers superannuation scheme was a voluntary scheme up to 1996 and many teachers did not join it at the earliest date possible. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  introduced a facility whereby scheme members could buy back earlier years when they were eligible to join the scheme but did not do so. More than 10,000 teachers applied to buy service for superannuation purposes under the PCW arrangements. More than half of those teachers opted to pay at retirement. Others, including the person in question, opted for a quotation for up-front payment in which case the buyback contribution is based on pay at the date of application. Work on the processing of these up-front applications is at an advanced stage. The cost of buyback for the person in question will be based on pay in 1998, when the application was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_2231">Prior to the introduction of the buyback arrangements, the only provision available to make up for shortfalls in pensionable service was the scheme for the purchase of notional service. Under this scheme, notional service could be purchased for superannuation purposes at full actuarial cost. The buyback scheme includes provisions for the offsetting of notional service contributions against the cost of buyback. The offsetting calculations are quite complex and take account of the particular circumstances of each teacher. The person in question applied to purchase notional service some years ago and is therefore in a position to avail of the offsetting arrangements. My Department expects to be in a position to issue a detailed quotation to her in the next week or so.</p>

          <p eId="para_2237">My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE schemes, my predecessor secured the transfer of some €58.4 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_131">The availability of this funding, that has been transferred to my Department from FÁS, has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to primary and second level schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. The increases in the  level of the school services support grants will be of benefit to the vast majority of primary and second level schools. The transfer of the money to this Department from FÁS also ensures that this money will now be available on an ongoing basis. My Department has also agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain participants may be entitled to continue working on the schemes in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">I am aware however that the phasing out of CE schemes may result in some schools experiencing certain difficulties. My Department has engaged a firm of consultants to examine the transitional difficulties that may be experienced and to consider how those adverse effects might be ameliorated. All schools will shortly receive a questionnaire from the consultants.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2245">Primary and second level schools are not required to notify my Department of cases where pupils are suspended or otherwise excluded from schools. For this reason there are no statistics currently available in this area. The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. Under Section 21 of the Act, principals of recognised schools are required to maintain, in respect of each school year, a record of the attendance record of each student registered at that school. In the event of a student being suspended from a recognised school for a period of not less than six days the principal of the school concerned is required to inform an educational welfare officer in writing. Boards of management of recognised schools are also required to submit a report to the relevant educational welfare officer six weeks after the end of the school year on the levels of attendance at the school during the preceding school year. The board appointed an interim chief  executive officer in August 2002 and is currently finalising its recruitment of head office staff. A total of 36 former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation were transferred to the board on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford in accordance with guidance issued to them by the board. Proposals for the recruitment of an additional cohort of educational welfare officers have now been received from the board and are currently being examined by my Department. It is intended that the first of the new staff will be appointed later this year. I have allocated a budget of €5.2 million to the new service for the current year.</p>

The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 which came into effect on 5 July 2002, provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service, with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body – the National Educational Welfare Board. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and to foster an appreciation of learning amongst the students. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. The board will also assist schools in discharging their responsibilities under the Act.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_135">Deputies may be aware that my Department introduced a new and significantly expanded programme in 2002 to deal with early school leaving. The school completion programme, SCP, incorporates the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. The SCP is based on an integrated approach to educational disadvantage, involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. Its objective is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project areas were selected, including two SCP project sites in the Dublin 17 area which involves one post primary school and four primary schools and a junior education training centre for travellers, together with relevant local statutory, voluntary and community agencies, the local drugs task forces and county-city development boards. The two projects in Dublin 17 have between them received allocations in excess of €300,000 under the SCP in respect of 2002-2003. This represents a valuable resource in the fight against early school leaving in the Dublin 17 area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2253">The school completion programme is designed to deal with issues of both concentrated and regionally dispersed disadvantage and is a key component of the Department of Education and Science's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach. This is the approach which my Department is now taking to address the problem of early school leaving which replaces the previous process of funding individual second level schools under the stay in school retention initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_2254">The school completion programme recognises that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving. Consequently, strategies designed to address the needs of young people at risk of early school leaving must include a range of actions that impinge on these aspects of young people's lives; these strategies must therefore be holistic and child-centred by nature. This programme aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_136">The school completion programme necessitates the establishment of local management groups to oversee the project at local level, involving both post-primary and primary schools together with relevant local statutory, voluntary and community bodies, the local drugs task Forces and county-city development boards. The local management groups are required to assess the needs of marginalised educationally disadvantaged young people at local level and devise integrated costed focused targeted retention plans that support these young people in their school, home and community life. Representatives of schools and agencies on the local management group must engage school staff and parents in a consultative and planning process in order that the  retention plans support the needs of all young people at-risk.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project sites were selected, including the Dublin 8 school completion project which commenced in November 2002 and consists of three post primary schools, which previously participated in the stay in school retention initiative and seven primary schools together with the relevant local statutory and voluntary agencies. Following the submission of a three year retention plan to tackle early school leaving, my Department allocated funding to the 82 projects to implement their retention plans which offers in-school, after-school, out-of-school and holiday-time supports to young people at risk.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2305">My Department has been working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government on the drafting of the regulations under which the elections to the first teaching council will take place. The drafting process is now nearing completion and I intend to have the regulations circulated to the education partners in the near future for their views before finalising them. Once the regulations have been finalised the next stage of the process in setting up the council will be to conduct the elections. A clear period of up to ten weeks will be required from announcement of the elections to actually holding them. This will enable people to seek nominations and to canvass for election. Since it will not be possible to complete this process before the summer school holidays and it would be inappropriate to carry it on during the holidays, I intend to commence it as early as possible in the new school year with a view to having the council in place early next year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_138">Once the council is in place a process of phased implementation of the Act will commence. The programme of implementation will be determined to a considerable extent on the newly elected council's view of its capacity to take on and carry out functions. Commencement, therefore, will take place against a background of consultation with the council. It is, however, my intention that the entire Act will become operational with the minimum of delay once the council is in place.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2408">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to provide broadband to Drogheda. From the outset, since becoming Minister I have prioritised the delivery of broadband in the north-east.</p>
          <p eId="para_2409">The question of rollout of broadband to the north-east is actively under consideration by my Department on foot of the joint application by the local authorities in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. I am well aware of the case for inclusion of Drogheda in this programme. Notwithstanding this application, Drogheda is already well served with broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_2410">DSL broadband is currently available in Drogheda. Eircom upgraded its exchange in Drogheda as a matter of urgency in 2003 and is now in a position to offer DSL broadband services on 17,000 lines in the town. Esat BT now has all the requisite DSL enabling equipment in place and its DSL service has been available to all customers within three to four kilometres of the exchange in Drogheda since autumn 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2411">The Deputy should also be aware that Drogheda is one of the test locations being proposed by Digiweb for its Louth wireless local area network (LAN) pilot trials.</p>
          <p eId="para_2412">To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_2413">In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-99 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value in both public and private funding of €70 million were supported and are now completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_2414">Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, Government is currently funding two additional projects to bring broadband to Drogheda. These are the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom which will serve Drogheda with high-speed broadband access, and also the Esat BT accelerated rollout of DSL broadband in 40 locations including Drogheda.</p>

          <p eId="para_2452">Data on each hospital discharge from publicly funded acute hospitals are collected by the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system which is administered by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. Clinical information on diagnosis and procedures is classified according to the international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) which is based on the World Health Organisations, WHO, 9th revision, international classification of diseases (ICD-9). The Central Statistics Office, CSO, compiles information on mortality derived from death registrations and uses ICD-9 to code cause of death.</p>
          <p eId="para_2453">The latest comprehensive annual data available from HIPE refers to the year 2001. Data for 2002 is nearing completion and will have close to full coverage by the end of June this year. Since there are many thousands of diagnoses and procedure codes in the ICD-9-CM classification it is possible to provide a wide range of morbidity analyses utilising the HIPE system. In March last year, the ESRI published a report on, Activity in Acute Public Hospitals in Ireland, 1990-1999, available in the Oireachtas Library, which summarises and reports on results over the 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_2454">Table 1 sets out figures on total numbers of day-case and in-patient discharges for major ICD-9-CM diagnosis chapters for the year 2001. It should be noted that patients admitted for treatment more than once during the year are counted separately in the statistics for each episode.</p>

          <p eId="para_2624">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 392 and 414 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2625">As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the provision of health services in Dublin 8 rests with the South-Western Area Health Board. My Department has been informed by the board that at present there are 18.7 vacancies out of board's complement of 45. As a result, there are waiting lists for the services of community occupational therapists.</p>
          <p eId="para_2626">The board has also advised that it is actively recruiting occupational therapists at present and it is expected that additional therapists will be appointed in the near future. Obviously this will help reduce the waiting time for all clients. In relation to the employment of occupational therapists, the board has stressed that provision of accurate information by all parties leads to applications being processed more speedily at every stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_2627">In the South-Western Area Health Board, the occupational therapists are actively examining ways of reducing waiting times for their service. A priority system is operated to determine that those with the most urgent needs are seen as quickly as possible. In the last year, an occupational therapist-hospital discharge facilitator was appointed to help ease the transition for patients from hospital to community. A pilot accident and emergency occupational therapist post was initiated to help prevent hospital admission for non-medical reasons. Discussions are taking place with acute hospital occupational therapists to provide an outreach service. Plans are progressing well on other initiatives to assist in a more timely provision of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_2628">In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, my Department has asked the chief executive of the South-Western Area Health Board to investigate the matter and to reply direct to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_2630">The working group on the role of the mental handicap nurse was established by the Department of Health in July, 1995 to review the role of the mental handicap nurse from a health service management perspective in preparation for the development of a diploma programme in mental handicap nurse training. One of the terms of reference of the working group was to make a recommendation as to the appropriate title under which a mental handicap nurse should register.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_169">The question of the title under which a mental handicap nurse should register was addressed in all of the submissions received by the working  group. All of the submissions requested that the word "nurse" be retained in the title. There were various interpretations of what other words should be included in the title such as Registered Mental Handicap Nurse, Registered Learning Disability Nurse, Registered Nurse for Mental Handicap, Registered Nurse for the Intellectually Disabled or Registered Nurse (Mental Handicap).</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_170">The working group discussed this matter at some length. It concurred with the general consensus that the term "nurse" should remain in the title. It considered that the term "mental handicap" in the title had been accepted by nurses, service providers, persons with a mental handicap, parents and friends of persons with a mental handicap and the general public. If any change in the terminology were to be considered then the opinions of a wide range of people would have to be elicited. In the meantime, however, the working group recommended that the term registered nurse (mental handicap) be used.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">An Bord Altranais has statutory responsibility for the training and registration of nurses in this country and is the regulatory body for the nursing profession.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">Section 27 of the Nurses Act 1985 provides for the maintenance of a register in accordance with the nurses rules promulgated under section 26 of the Act. The Nurses Rules 1988 provide for the division of the register into seven divisions, of which the division for mental handicap nursing specifies the designation, registered mental handicap nurse. The redesignation of the title of a nurse on the register would require a rule change by the board.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">I understand from the board that the question as to the designation of mental handicap nursing and registered mental handicap nurse was raised at their last meeting on 13 February 2003. The board referred the matter to the education and training committee for further consideration.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2635">Action 105 of the health strategy commits my Department to strengthening and expanding provisions for statutory registration of health professionals. In this context legislation is being prepared to establish a system of statutory registration for health and social care professions, including physiotherapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2636">The heads of a Bill establishing this system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals have been approved by Government and submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting a Bill based on the proposals outlined in the heads. As detailed in the health strategy, the target date for the introduction of this legislation is 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2637">Under these proposals, it is intended to protect the title of physiotherapist, that is, only those professionals registered with the registration board for physiotherapists will be legally entitled to use the title, "Physiotherapist".</p>
          <p eId="para_2638">It it also proposed that it will be an offence under the proposed legislation for an unregistered person either to use a protected title or to act in a manner which implies that they are entitled to use a protected title. In such circumstances it will be a matter for the proposed regulatory authority for health and social care professionals to investigate any complaint that a person is misrepresenting themselves in any of these respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_2639">It will also be the responsibility of the regulatory authority to ensure that members of the public are properly informed and guided that a registered professional providing a service is suitably qualified and competent. It will remain the responsibility of every individual practitioner providing health care services to the public to ensure that they are trained and qualified to the level required to work safely within their area of competence.</p>
          <p eId="para_2640">In drafting the legislation, further advice and examination will be required of the many complex legal, competition and public interest issues that arise under the Bill, including in relation to protection of title.</p>
          <p eId="para_2641">I have received correspondence from the Irish Association of Physical Therapists and representatives of this association met with officials of my Department on 21 March last to discuss their concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_2673">I am aware that the home birth pilot project in University College Hospital, Galway, has been suspended by the Western Health Board. There are no plans to curtail the projects in Cork and Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_2674">The number of births in University College Hospital, Galway, rose from 2,830 in 2000 to 3,218 in 2002, with births to non-nationals increasing from 2% to 11.5% over the same period. The home birth pilot project was introduced in 1999 and provided six home births and 21 DOMINO births in year one; 8 home births and 100 DOMINO births in year two; 15 home births and 143 DOMINO births in year three.</p>
          <p eId="para_2675">The service plan adopted by the Western Health Board for 2003 agreed the need to appoint a consultant neonatologist and an additional consultant obstetrician to meet both the volume and complexity of cases presenting at University College Hospital, Galway. The service plan approved the transfer of funding from domiciliary home care services to support this priority development. The home birth scheme was suspended on this basis. The current caseload of patients who have booked for home births will have their service completed and these commitments will be fulfilled. No new patients are being accepted on to the scheme at this time. I am advised that the board's obstetric services will be further reviewed on the appointment of the consultant neonatologist within the framework of priority service objectives and national policy.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_175">The home birth pilot projects have their origin in the report of the maternity and infant care  scheme review group which was published in 1994. Following the publication of this report, the chief executive officers of the health boards established an expert group to consider approaches to providing a home birth service as suggested by the review group.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">The expert group recommended the following three pilot projects which were subsequently established and funded by my Department: a community midwifery service, to be conducted in Cork by the Southern Health Board; a hospital outreach approach to be conducted by the Western Health Board and based at the University College Hospital, Galway; and a DOMINO/outreach project domiciliary care in and out of hospital, based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">At the request of my Department, the chief executive officers group has now established a domiciliary births group with the following terms of reference: prepare an up to date progress report on the implementation of the recommendations from the expert group on domiciliary births 1997; to make recommendations on the long-term approach, arising from the outcome of the pilot schemes, and to establish protocols and procedures; to commission an external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">The group met for the first time on Tuesday, 11 February 2003. The tendering process for the external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects is currently under way. The group expects to make its recommendations to the chief executive officer group towards the end of this year and no later than early 2004. These recommendations will inform the development of future national policies, procedures and protocols for domiciliary births.</summary>

The principal national legislation are the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989, which set out the statutory requirements in relation to food hygiene and the registration of food premises, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998, which provides environmental health officers with much of their enforcement powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2742">In recent years, and in particular since the development of the internal market, almost all food law has been based on legislation agreed by member states of the EU. The EU-based legislation under which environmental health officers operate, includes the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2000, which require food business proprietors to ensure that their business is operated in a hygienic way, and the European Communities (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998, which set out general principles in relation to the official control of foodstuffs.</p>

          <p eId="para_2772">In December 2002, the Irish Medical Organisation advised that its members would not participate in contingency planning for biological threats. More recently, the IMO advised my Department that from 10 March 2003 its members would refuse to co-operate with new work practices and programmes, step down from acting up positions and stop providing cross cover. The grades of doctors involved are directors of public health, specialists in public health medicine, senior area medical officers and area medical officers.</p>

Emergency cover in relation to infectious disease outbreaks is being provided by public health doctors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">On 20 March 2003, the IMO indicated that the public health doctors would defer serving notice for strike action for two weeks in view of the commencement of the war in Iraq. My Department and the Health Service Employers' Agency, HSEA, have met with the IMO in the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, on a number of occasions. An offer has been made to the IMO. In making this offer, my Department and the HSEA again strongly encouraged the IMO to stay within procedures, to call off this industrial action and, failing a resolution of the dispute at the LRC, to have the matter referred to the Labour Court for investigation. The IMO gave a clear indication that it was not disposed to having the matter referred to the Court. The HSEA is continuing its efforts to have a resumption of discussion at the LRC with the IMO.</summary>

The equipping needs of the rest of the new building are being examined at present, and will be agreed as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_2792">With regard to the 23 bed medical ward, shelled-out area, the work carried out under the present contract is to protect the option for 23 additional medical beds. This work allows the board to complete the fit out at a future date without causing disruption to the rest of the hospital. The fit out of these beds is a matter to be considered after the primary development works at the hospital have been commissioned. The roof repairs are regarded as essential and these will be progressed as a matter of priority.</p>

In developing the service plan a considerable amount of detail covering the many  programmes is taken into consideration by the boards-authority, including issues such as the projected outturn for the previous year and the expected demand and needs for the coming year. In that context, as this level of detail is not available to me, I have asked the health boards-authority to provide the detail covered in the Deputy's question. Accordingly, my Department has written to the chief executive officers of each of the health boards-authority and asked them to supply the information directly to the Deputy. Similarly, as St. John's Hospital, Limerick, receives an annual determination directly from my Department, the chief executive of St. John's Hospital has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy.</summary>

In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2887">I met in recent weeks with the New Crumlin Hospital Group, which is composed of parents of children who regularly attend Crumlin Hospital for treatment. It was this group that commissioned the Pollock report into facilities at Crumlin.</p>
          <p eId="para_2888">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin Hospital, last year I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_2889">Many of the buildings comprised within the hospital are approximately 50 years old, and have not been upgraded in any significant way over that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2890">The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. Work on the preparation of the development brief has commenced, and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_194">It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. A phased approach will ensure that services continue to be  provided at the hospital during the redevelopment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_195">A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a €30 million investment in the new operating department which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five major theatres and two minor theatres. Included in this development are new recovery beds, a day surgery unit and a modern central sterile supplies department. This development is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both in-patient and out-patient level.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_196">In addition, on the basis of the volume and complexity of cases being dealt with at the hospital, I have approved the provision of an MRI facility at Crumlin which will significantly enhance the level of diagnostic services provided for children. The project team is currently engaged in the process of identifying the most appropriate location for this service in the context of the overall development plan for the hospital.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2909">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_197">In 2003, further additional funding of €13.3  million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to €340 million over seven years. Of this total, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_198">This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places were provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. The period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_199">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. People with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adapted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health service. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision.</summary>

Membership of the task force includes representatives of the relevant nursing unions, PNA and SIPTU, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. The task force was given the following terms of reference: to investigate the reasons for such assaults with a view to the putting in place of effective preventative measures; to examine the incidence of assaults on nurses and the level of injury therefrom; to put forward proposals for an appropriate compensation scheme for nurses injured through assault at work, such proposals to have regard to the special position of psychiatric nurses and to prepare and present a report of its findings and recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children.</p>

Initial funding for the project was provided under the national development plan allocation for 2000. Capital funding amounting to €754,210 has been committed to this project by my Department, the Southern Health Board and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under its Clár programme.

From the additional funding available to the Southern Health Board in 2003, funding of €78,000 has been provided to the centre for 2003. Officers of the Southern Health Board are in discussions with my Department and the Kilgarvan Community Council and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in relation to the operation of the centre to determine the level of service which can be provided from the level of funding available for this year.</p>

In its report of March 2001, the working group stated that the prevalence of ADD-DHD in Ireland can be estimated at somewhere between 1% and 5% of school age children, those aged 5-15 years, which is in line with the research findings in other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_2983">The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. In 2002, additional revenue funding of €6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003. The health strategy Quality and Fairness contains a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report.</p>

          <p eId="para_3037">The provision of health related services, including home support services, for people with physical and-or sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_3038">My Department has, since 1997, allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector which has resulted in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health related services which are being provided to people with disabilities. Additional funding of €27 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to further enhance the services in the sector. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €288 million which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_3039">Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include, residential, respite, home support services which includes personal assistance services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding, more than €20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further €81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances.</p>
          <p eId="para_3040">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of services across all service programmes including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health board and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</p>

      the reason the draft national standards for disability services which will apply to disability services for children and adults with autism, intellectual, physical and sensory disability, and funded by his Department will not apparently apply to services for people with psychiatric disabilities, in view of the indictment of those services contained within successive annual reports of the Inspector for Mental Hospitals, the recent Amnesty report on conditions for people with psychiatric problems in Ireland and the recent Irish Psychiatric Association survey of psychiatric services.

          <p eId="para_3053">The provision of good quality services, with a greater focus on delivery, value for money and responsiveness to customer requirements are central to my plans and policy for public transport. In recent years we have seen a significant increase in public transport investment and an associated expansion in services. The quality of those ser vices is also improving although much remains to be done. In my statement of 7 November 2002 to the Public Transport Partnership Forum, I set out my proposals for regulatory and structural reform of public transport designed, among other things, to improve service delivery. Shortly afterwards I also published for public consultation a consultancy study containing recommendations on new arrangements for the procurement and regulation of bus services outside the greater Dublin area. I am also currently considering the findings and recommendations of the strategic rail review, which provides a blueprint for the development of our railways.</p>
          <p eId="para_3054">The underlying purpose of all of these initiatives is the delivery of more and better quality public transport services throughout the country to the customer, at reasonable value to the user and the taxpayer. I am confident that the policies which I am pursuing will lead to growth of our public transport system and provide an attractive alternative to the private car. As to the provision of bus stops, this is a day-to-day operational matter for the transport operators concerned.</p>

These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists.

An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. Having regard to these circumstances, and having considered the various views expressed on this issue, it was decided on completion of the review that there should be no change in the existing bus lane access provisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_3084">My Department has been examining the most appropriate arrangements for implementing Directive 2000/30/EC on random roadside inspections of motor vehicles in consultation with the Garda Síochána with a view to determining the most appropriate structures and systems to enable inspections to be carried out in accordance with the directive. I expect to be in a position to transpose Directive 2000/30/EC into Irish law shortly through the making of regulations under the European Communities Act 1972. In the reply to the reasoned opinion on 17 February 2003, the European Commission has been advised to that effect. Inspections in accordance with the directive must await the regulations. However, roadside roadworthiness inspections of vehicles have been carried out by my Department from time to time over the past three years as part of multi-agency road checks.</p>

          <p eId="para_3086">Matters connected with the Dublin Port tunnel are the responsibility of the National Roads Authority and Dublin City Council. However, I am informed by the NRA that the original tender price was €449 million, for construction only, in June 2000. Together with land and property compensation, supervision costs and other mis cellaneous costs, the total estimated project cost was approximately €533 million in year 2000 prices. The total estimated cost of the project in year 2002 prices is €625 million. The increase of 17% is attributable primarily to inflation, with some additions for land cost claims.</p>

          <p eId="para_3088">It is my policy that all bus and rail transport operators, and in particular the State owned transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them. In accordance with the national development plan, all buses purchased by both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann since 2000 for use on urban services are low floor and wheelchair accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_3089">In pursuing this policy almost 35% of the Dublin Bus city fleet and some 35 bus routes in Dublin now have fully accessible services. Following a comprehensive bus replacement programme in recent years, Bus Éireann's entire regular urban fleets in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are low floor wheelchair accessible vehicles. In addition, the company has 20 low floor wheelchair accessible buses on a number of rural routes and has six low floor double deck buses on the Ashbourne-Dublin commuter route. Bus Éireann is continuing to monitor developments in relation to the design and manufacture of long distance coaches, which would improve the company's capacity to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments on their inter-urban services.</p>
          <p eId="para_3090">The DART and Arrow suburban rail services are wheelchair accessible over most of the network. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that all new rolling stock is designed to meet the most up to date accessibility standards. All DART carriages have the same floor height, which is 1,067 mm above rail level. However, depending on platform curvature, door positioning and the location at which the train stops, there can be variation in the height at which passengers transfer between the train and the station platform. Accordingly, some customers may require help in negotiating the gap at some stations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_209">In these cases, portable ramps are available at 28 out of 30 DART stations and Iarnród Éireann  staff will provide assistance. Glenageary and Bayside stations are, at present, inaccessible to wheelchair users and accordingly do not have mobile ramps. However, I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that these stations will be upgraded over the next couple of years and will be made accessible to mobility-impaired passengers.</summary>

The new public order legislation which is currently going through the Oireachtas will greatly enhance the power of the Garda to deal with anti-social behaviour.

          <p eId="para_3127">The purpose of Directive 2000/43/EC is to lay down a framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, with a view to putting into effect in the member states the principle of equal treatment.</p>

          <p eId="para_3129">In the second half of 2002, my Department consulted relevant Government Departments, the social partners, the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and the Labour Court in relation to the implementation of the race directive, the employment framework directive and the framework directive on equal treatment in employment-gender in relation to the Employment Equality Act 1998. Proposals, for submission to Government, are currently being drafted in relation to the 1998 Act. No formal consultation, in relation to the non-employment aspects of the race directive, was considered necessary as the Equal Status Act 2000 is substantially compliant with the race directive. However, written submissions have been received from relevant bodies in relation to the transposition of the non-employment aspects of the directive. Proposals for submission to Government in relation to the 2000 Act are also being drafted. It is hoped to publish the Bill amending the Act in the summer with a view to its implementation at the earliest possible date.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_224">Transposition of the race directive in itself does not place an onus on the Irish Government to amend the existing equality legislation to impose positive duties to eradicate institutional racism on  the private or public sectors. It does, however, require the designation of a body for the promotion of equal treatment of all persons without discriminating of the grounds of racial or ethnic origin. The Equality Authority, which was established under the Employment Equality Act 1998, is this designated body. It has statutory responsibility to work towards the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities in relation to employment and the provision of goods and services on the nine discriminatory grounds included in the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_225">As part of its functions, the authority is empowered to invite businesses to carry out an equality review and to prepare and implement an equality action plan or, where the business does not have less than 50 employees, the authority can carry out such a review or prepare such an action plan. These powers of the authority should ensure the development of a proactive equality conscious approach to equal opportunities in the workplace and in relation to the provision of goods and services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_226">My Department has taken recent initiatives to address racism.

This was an action research and training project carried out in 2002, involving both prisoners and prison officers at Wheatfield Prison in Dublin. An independent evaluation of the project and recommendations for future action then took place. The National Training and Development Institute, in conjunction with Fitzpatrick Associates, made a presentation of findings and recommendations to the Prison Service. This was published to coincide with European Week against Racism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, which is funded by my Department, has recently launched guidelines for developing a "whole organisation" approach to address racism and to support interculturalism. These guidelines are part of a series of publications aimed at supporting the development of appropriate strategies for working in an increasingly diverse society. The guidelines are about promoting good practice and are designed to be consistent with the equality legislation, the development of equality action plans and the equality-diversity aspects of the Government's quality customer service initiative.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3137">As I indicated in reply to a question from Deputy Costello on 25 February 2003, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe, was established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in 1987. The committee is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts, parliamentarians and so on from the member states and carries out its task by periodic and <i>ad hoc</i> visits. During these visits, the committee has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained, whether it be a prison, a Garda station or a mental hospital, and are  entitled to speak in private to any detained person.</p>
          <p eId="para_3138">The CPT visited Ireland for inspection purposes in May of last year and the report to the Irish Government on this visit was received in my Department recently. In line with the provisions of the convention, the Government has a timeframe of six months to respond to the CPT on the findings contained in the report. It is expected that the report and proposed responses to the findings will be brought to Government in the near future. In line with the policy of previous Governments, I expect to publish the report along with the responses to the findings once these have been approved by Government and conveyed to the CPT.</p>

Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.

          <p eId="para_3168">I wish to advise the House that none of the prison visiting committees have formally raised the specific issues referred to by the Deputy with me, my predecessor or my Department over the past five years. The visiting committees, however, from time to time, bring to attention matters which they feel should be highlighted. This is normally achieved through direct contact with the governor of the institution to which they are appointed or through their annual report.</p>

      asked the

      the number of times in the past five years that his Department has asked prison visiting committees to use their power to hold sworn inquiries into disciplinary matters involving prisoners; and the number of times prison visiting committees have used their power to grant prisoners special privileges or impose punishments.

          <p eId="para_3170">As I previously explained to the House, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925. Section (3)(3) of the above Act which provided for the powers referred to by the Deputy was repealed by section 19(5) of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_3171">It is the normal practice of the visiting committees to raise all matters brought to their attention with the governor of the institution to which they have been appointed. In the vast majority of cases, the committee can satisfy itself in this manner that either the complaint is not justified or that the governor will take appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3172">On occasion, prison visiting committees have requested the local prison authorities to grant special privileges to prisoners, such as an extra telephone call or extra time on a visit, which the authorities are normally able to facilitate.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_235">The average cost of keeping an offender is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions. These costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of offenders in custody – for example, utilities, staff salaries, etc.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">In regard to the figures for the individual prisons, I would like to inform the Deputy of the following: Cloverhill Prison became fully operational during 2001 and, therefore, no figures have been included for previous years; Castlerea Prison opened in May 1998 and did not reach full capacity until 1999. This resulted in a higher average cost per prisoner in 1998; the increase in average cost in 1999 for Portlaoise Prison compared to 1998 and 2000 reflected the reduction in average numbers due to prisoners being released under the Good Friday Agreement. The average number of prisoners detained in the prison has increased since this time; the average number of prisoners in Limerick Prison in 1997 was 145 compared to 225 in 1999 and 2000. This resulted in a higher average cost per prisoner in 1997; and the significant increase in the average cost of keeping an offender in Shelton Abbey in 2001 arose from the reduction of the centre's capacity by 50% to facilitate major remedial works, which have now been completed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">The overall average cost of keeping an offender increased by 35.8% over this five year period. The general decrease in 1999 arose because additional staff were recruited in advance of the new prison in Cloverhill opening  in 2000. The additional staff were initially assigned to other prisons which resulted in reduced overtime costs in these prisons. In addition, there was an overall increase in the number of prisoners throughout the prison system. The biggest factor which resulted in the increase in average prisoner costs over this five year period was pay increases resulting from national pay agreements.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_263">Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2 (4) of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. In any proceedings under the 1964 Act,  where the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. The balance struck in the existing provisions is a good one in that it provides that an unmarried father can become the guardian of his child by agreement with the mother or by obtaining a court order and, in making such an order, the court is required to regard the child's welfare as the first and paramount consideration. Similarly, decisions on access must be based on the child's welfare and I would not support any alternative provisions.</summary>

These Acts require the court to have regard in particular to a range of factors reflecting the income, assets and needs of the parties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_265">Under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the court has power to make such orders for the payment of maintenance in respect of a child as it considers reasonable. The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 gives the court power to make such orders for payment of maintenance as is proper in the circumstances.</summary>

Also, an application for an interim barring order must be made either on affidavit or on sworn information and, if the order is made ex parte, a note of the evidence given together with the court order and the affidavit or sworn information must be served on the respondent as soon as practicable.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3662">The Garda Síochána has responsibility for the enforcement of immigration law in this State and it is a matter for it to determine what initiatives are necessary to ensure compliance with that law. The need for immigrant labour cannot simply override the State's obligation to effectively regulate the migration of non-nationals to the State. It is in the interests of both the State and migrant workers alike to ensure that such migration is carried out in a structured and legally sound manner. Although enforcement is only one feature of policy in relation to immigration, it is an important element not only in terms of ensuring the integrity and authority of the State but also to ensure fair treatment of migrant workers. I am sure the Deputy will recognise that without enforcement of regulations governing employment in Ireland we risk exposing non-nationals to dangerous exploitation.</p>

However, the EU commitment to supporting developing countries under its water initiative is not affected by its objectives in the context of WTO negotiations on trade in services to such improved market access for its service sector supplies.</p>

      the standards which apply to the disposal of domestic and agricultural sewage sludge here; the most common toxic substances found in sludge; and the level of testing, monitoring and enforcement that is carried out here.

          <p eId="para_3715">Sewage sludge is an inevitable and potentially useful by-product of  advanced waste water treatment processes. Overall volumes of such sludge will grow as a result of the major investment in waste water treatment facilities under the national development plan. It is therefore desirable, and in accordance with EU requirements, that sewage sludge should be refused wherever appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_3716">The Environmental Protection Agency report on urban waste water discharges in Ireland for 1998 and 1999 advised that, at that time, 44.6% of sewage sludge was disposed of through landfill, 23.2% to agriculture and 31.3% to the marine environment. The route for the remaining 0.9% is unspecified. Disposal to the marine environment, which was principally from the Ringsend treatment works, has now ceased.</p>
          <p eId="para_3717">My Department has taken steps over the past decade to promote improved management of sewage sludge – for example, by providing detailed guidelines and financial assistance to support the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities. Reuse in agriculture is one of the available options. Sludge can be treated to produce a pasteurised fertiliser referred to as biosolid. To further assist the farming sector and local authorities in implementing this approach A Code of Good Practice for the Use of Biosolids in Agriculture has been published. This advises on the appropriate standards of treatment and quality of the sewage sludge.</p>
          <p eId="para_3718">Where sewage sludge is reused in agriculture it is subject to compliance with the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations 1998, as amended, which gives effect to Council Directive 86/278/EC dated 12 June 1986. The regulations specify sampling, analyses and monitoring requirements, set limit values for metal concentrations that may be applied to land and require that the sludge is not used except in accordance with a nutrient management plan. The regulations also place a responsibility on local authorities to plan, control and enforce the disposal and/or reuse of sewage sludge within their functional areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_3719">Sewage sludge and soil must be analysed and sampled in accordance with national and EU regulations. The sewage sludge user is responsible for monitoring. The data produced are provided to local authorities and in turn transmitted to the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency's analyses of sewage sludges are reported biannually. The last published report for urban waste water discharges in Ireland for the years 1998 and 1999 is available in the Library and includes information on the maximum concentration of heavy metals in sludges – table 5.8 – and soils – table 5.9 – where sludge was reused in agriculture.</p>

          <p eId="para_3722">Met Éireann provides tables of extreme rainfalls of durations from one minute to 96 hours with return periods from half year to 100 years for any location in Ireland. This statistical information is based on the methods as outlined in the British and Irish Flood Studies Report – Natural Environment Research Council 1975 – and employs long time series of rainfall data from hundreds of stations around the country, including some which reported at hourly or higher temporal resolution. Due to the high spatial variability of rainfall, this comprehensive countrywide service cannot be based on data from synoptic stations only, of which, at any one time, there are at most 16.</p>
          <p eId="para_3723">All estimates of extreme rainfall are statistically based and, as such, have an associated uncertainty. In particular, they depend on the period covered by the observational data and will thus produce somewhat different results depending on the basic data used. Work is under way within Met Éireann to produce quality assured data up to the end of 2002 from several hundred stations, and to develop some refinements of the methods that were used in the above mentioned publication. This work will update extreme rainfall tables and allow them to be used with increased confidence. No generally accepted method exists at this stage to take into account future climate change in the area of extreme rainfall return periods.</p>

          <p eId="para_3741">Primary responsibility among public authorities for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. The EPA exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_277">Eutrophication or over-enrichment of waters, caused mainly by excess inputs of phosphorus and to a lesser extent nitrates, is the main threat to  Irish water quality. Since 1997 my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive national strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. A catchment-based approach to water quality enables all sources of pollution to be dealt with on a systematic and integrated basis. As part of this strategy, major catchment-based projects were established in respect of Loughs Derg, Ree and Leane – Killarney – and the Rivers Suir, Boyne and Liffey – the three rivers project – for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems. The strategy is also underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations 1998, which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by end 2007.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_278">On 29 November 2002 I launched the final report of the three rivers project, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. This was the culmination of this €6 million project which has put in place systematic monitoring and management systems for water quality in these three catchments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_279">Although water quality in the overall River Suir system deteriorated slightly over the lifetime of the project, it is considerably less polluted than the Boyne and Liffey systems and over 70% of the Suir channel length is classified as unpolluted in the EPA report on water quality in Ireland for the period 1998-2000. The report also found that major capital expenditure on the upgrading of the wastewater treatment plant at Tipperary has resulted in significant improvement in water quality in the River Suir system downstream of this plant. Completion of the major wastewater treatment plant at Cahir, has also contributed to improved water quality in the Suir catchment during the course of the project. These facilities, funded by my Department with 85% support provided by the EU Cohesion Fund, are part of a €46 million investment to date in the River Suir catchment water quality management scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_280">A new waste water treatment plant at Carrick-on-Suir is being progressed as part of the South Tipperary grouped design-build-operate, DBO, waste water treatment scheme which also covers: the design, construction and operation of new waste water treatment plants at Ballyclerihan, Ardfinnan, Clogheen and Ballyporeen; the upgrading, operation and maintenance of existing waste water treatment plants at Clonmel, Cashel, Fethard, Killenaule and Kilsheelan; and the operation and maintenance of existing waste water treatment plants at Cahir and Tipperary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_281">All works will be undertaken under a single contract. When completed the new and upgraded treatment plants will cater for all major current and foreseeable wastewater treatment needs and ensure high standards of water quality protection in the Suir catchment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_282">My Department is now promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water quality and  quantity in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution. These projects will facilitate implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive which requires the maintenance of high status water quality, where it exists, and the achievement of at least good water status, as defined in the directive, generally within a 15 year timeframe. Financial support at a rate of 100% will be provided by my Department for expenditure incurred by local authorities in relation to these projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_283">The work of the three rivers project in the Suir catchment is being continued and expanded as part of the south east river basin management project which began in March 2002. This project, which will cost an estimated €8.25 million, is being led by Carlow County Council on behalf of the ten participating county councils, that is, Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary North, Tipperary South, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow. In addition to the relevant county councils, the project will also include participation by numerous agencies and interests in relation to agriculture, fisheries, flood management and habitat protection, and will involve a programme of activities to promote public information and consultation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_284">The objective of the project is to establish a water quality monitoring and management system in relation to the combined river basins in the south east and to provide the bulk of the baseline information required for the development of a comprehensive river basin management plan for the area. It will identify all significant impacts on water quality and quantity, set quality objectives and identify and put in place the necessary monitoring and management measures to achieve those objectives.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3774">The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, YPFSF, was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_3775">Funding for the YPFSF transferred from the Vote of the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2003. An amount of €15.877 million has been provided for the fund in 2003. It should be noted that there is no involvement of CAB proceeds in funding the YPFSF.</p>
          <p eId="para_3776">The National Assessment Committee, NAC, of the YPFSF, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining the services projects funded under round one of the fund. The intention would be where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed by enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_3777">Qualification for continued funding will be dependent on the successful evaluation of each project, including St. Monica's Youth Centre, by the services steering group, which has been set up to examine the projects, and sufficient funding being in place.

          <p eId="para_3847">The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance opportunity for people to improve their education and to enhance their opportunities to access the labour market. It was decided that the back to education allowance scheme should be re-focused towards people most at risk and who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_328">On the basis that claimants in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects, I decided that the focus of the scheme should be  on persons in pursuit of courses to primary degree level. Giving further support to people to gain postgraduate qualifications is not appropriate and that resources should be directed to those with more pressing needs. Accordingly, from 1 January 2003 students wishing to pursue a postgraduate course of study are no longer eligible for the back to education allowance. Students already pursuing a postgraduate course will not be affected by the change to the scheme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3864">A person with dependent children who has been recently widowed is entitled to: a widowed parent grant, a once-off payment for a widowed parent with a dependent child or children in the immediate aftermath of bereavement. This grant is €2,500; and a bereavement grant of €635 which is based on the PRSI contributions of the person who died or the spouse.</p>
          <p eId="para_3865">Widows and widowers who do not qualify for the widow or widower contributory pension qualify, subject to the means test, for the one parent family payment if they have dependent children. A recipient of the one parent family payment may earn up to €146.50 a week and may still qualify for a full payment. If a recipient earns between €146.50 and €293 she or he may qualify for a reduced payment. If a recipient of this payment subsequently exceeds €293 the payment may continue for one year at half rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_3866">A recipient of either contributory or non-contributory widow or widower pension may also be eligible, in addition, to half the personal rate of certain benefits such as unemployment and disability benefit for a limited period where the conditions of entitlement to those benefits are fulfilled. Recipients of either pension may also apply for fuel allowance or family income supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_3867">Since 1998 the rate of payment of widow or widower contributory and non-contributory has increased by about 38%. Recipients of the contributory pension receive a higher rate of payment –€130.30 for widows or widowers under age 66 – and higher child dependent, €21.60, increases than many other welfare recipients. In the programme for Government, we have committed to implementing further improvements to the widow or widower pension.</p>
